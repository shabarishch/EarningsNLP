Good afternoon, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We had a<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> terrific quarter and a tremendous number of wins in the Cloud with total revenue growth one point above the high end of my guidance and earnings per share $0.05 above the high end of my guidance.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before further discussing our Q4 results, I'd like to comment on updates we've made to our financial reporting so as to better describe our business since we introduced the BYOL license initiatives to our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">BYOL, which is Bring Your Own License, allows customers to move their existing on-premise licenses to the Oracle Cloud so long as they continue to pay support for those licenses. BYOL also makes it cost effective for customers to buy new licenses, even if those licenses are only going to be used in the Cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So some of our customers are buying new licenses and immediately deploying them in the Cloud. In fact, our largest license sale in the quarter was a Cloud license.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Other customers, like AT&amp;T in their release, are moving their existing licenses, excuse me, moving the existing licenses they own to the Cloud while continuing to pay support. Support for licenses that have been moved to the Cloud is Cloud support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, our new license revenue is now a combination of new Cloud licenses and new on-premise licenses. Our support revenue is now a combination of Cloud license support revenue and on-premise license support revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To reflect these changes in our business, we have now labeled new software licenses as Cloud license and on-premise license, and we\u2019ve combined Cloud SaaS plus Cloud PaaS and IaaS plus software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to say it another way, customers are entering into large database contracts where some of those database licenses are to be deployed on-premise, while other database licenses are used in the Cloud. Previously, all of those license and its related support revenue would have been counted entirely as on-premise, which clearly it isn\u2019t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, customers that are in the process of moving their existing database licenses to the Cloud previously had all of their support revenue counted as on-premise. Again, which it isn\u2019t. We have reflected these revenue reporting updates in our expense reporting as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Cloud SaaS and PaaS and IaaS Services are all moving into our new second-generation data centers based on our bare metal infrastructure with a single unified operations team. Data center expenses there are shared across SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, giving us economies of scale and other efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve also consolidated most support functions across our software technologies in the Cloud and on-premise. Sharing our teams across the different offerings allows for improved asset utilization and has a positive effect on our gross and operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now that we\u2019ve built a rapidly-growing multibillion dollar Cloud business, our management team is focused on two principal financial measures to judge our success. First, we expect our overall revenue growth rate to accelerate because our growing Cloud revenue is becoming a larger and larger percentage of our total revenue. While any one quarter\u2019s results may vary, we expect to increase our revenue growth rate this year and beyond. Second, we expect that we will once again deliver double-digit EPS growth for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Turning back to our results, first, I\u2019ll go over Q4 and recap fiscal year 2018 before moving on to my guidance. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As in prior quarters, I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rate, unless I say otherwise. This quarter, currency movements resulted in a 2% tailwind on revenue, which was approximately $140 million less than when guidance was given, and currency movements had a $0.02 positive impact to non-GAAP EPS, which was $0.01 less than the $0.03 which I guided to. Regardless, we exceeded the high-end of both ranges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total cloud services and license support revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, up 5% in constant currency, 7% in U.S. dollars. Under our prior reporting structure, in Q4, what we previously called total Cloud revenues were $1.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I cannot stress enough the stability and growth of our installed base of customers quarter-after-quarter. Our customers are maintaining and expanding their Oracle environments because they have portability to use our licensed software on-premise, in the Cloud or via hybrid environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is largely because our products are capable of doing things others just can\u2019t do, whether that\u2019s security, performance, scalability or the autonomous features that only our database has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As our customers adopt our technologies, whether via licenses or Cloud services, our overall customer base is growing, and that growth is starting to accelerate. The gross margin for Cloud services and license support was 86% and as we continue to scale and grow, I expect this will go even higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total revenues for the quarter were $11.3 billion, up 1% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 billion, up 4% from last year and the operating margin was 47% which was up from 46% last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 19.2%, slightly below our base tax rate of 20% and EPS was $0.99 in USD, up 11% and up 9% in constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% and GAAP EPS was $0.82 in USD, up 8% and up 5% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now moving on to the full fiscal year. Total Cloud services and license support revenue was $26.3 billion, growing 7%. Total company revenues for the year grew 3% to $39.9 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.12 in USD, up 11% in constant currency and up 14% in USD. This was largely driven by the acceleration in operating income growth which was up 9% in USD, 6% in constant currency. This is mirrored in our operating margin for the full year which was up from 43% last year to 44% this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a reminder, our best-ever full year operating margin was 47% and I expect we will surpass that in the coming years as our total revenue growth accelerates and we benefit from greater scale in our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was a record $15.4 billion, up 9% in USD. Capital expenditures for the year were $1.7 billion and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.7 billion, up 13% in USD. We now have approximately $67.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is approximately $6.6 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.4 billion, up 2% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. This quarter we repurchased 106 million shares for a total of 5 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the last 12-months, we have repurchased 238 million shares for a total of 11.5 billion. Since FY 2011, when we ramped up the share purchase program, we have reduced the shares outstanding by more than 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we have paid out dividends of $3.1 billion over the last 12-months and the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to the guidance. First of all, we will be adopting the new accounting standard ASC 606 with a full retrospective view starting in Q1. We will also provide you with the prior-year results reflecting ASC 606 so that you can compare it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Secondly, my EPS guidance for both Q1 and FY 2019 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base rate, but I expect that in normalizing for these onetime events, our tax rate will average around 20% for fiscal year 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, in regard to Q1 guidance, exchange rates have moved from a 3% revenue tailwind to now being a 1% headwind from the last time I gave guidance. That is a 4% negative move, which impacts revenue in Q1 by about $300 million. It also impacts EPS negatively by $0.03.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, for my guidance, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow between 9% and 13%. I\u2019ll do the math for you, that\u2019s between $0.67 and $0.69. And non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 11% and 15%, and, again, doing the math, that\u2019s $0.68 to $0.70.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, we expect to have a higher revenue growth rate than FY 2018 and once again deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. Total CapEx for FY 2019 is expected to be similar to FY 2018\u2019s CapEx of $1.7 billion, but it could be a little higher depending on bookings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark for his comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Hurd</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Safra.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I thought for a change I\u2019d just start by listing off Cloud wins in Q4. Let\u2019s start with ERP. Let me just run through some of these brands. BEA, Baylor University, Cerberus Capital Management, ConEd, Cox Communication, Danaher, Facebook, General Dynamics, Genuine Auto Parts, Intel, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kohl\u2019s Department Stores, Land O\u2019Lakes, Marsh &amp; McLennan, Mount Sinai Health System, Pernod Ricard, Scholastic Corporation, Siemens, Cleveland Clinic, Time Inc., United Parcel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These can be modules. In many cases, we\u2019re replacing in for SAP. Some cases upgrading our user base. This was a fantastic ERP quarter. And not just in volume, but the quality of the brands. Let me turn to HCM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I go into details, let me just say every win is versus Workday, full stop. Akamai, AT&amp;T, Baylor University. As you can tell, that was a dual ERP HCM win. You\u2019ll hear a few of those. City of Jacksonville, ConEd, Delta Dental, First Data, Grupo Televisa, Ingersoll Rand, Juniper, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Manpower Group, Mount Sinai Health System. Again, a multi-dual win, if you will. Noble Energy, Providence St. Joseph Health, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Sherwin-Williams, Time Inc., Toyota Motor, University of Wisconsin, Zebra Technologies. A lot of wins. And I have more, I just don\u2019t have time. It was that sort of quarter for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to platform, two very significant ISVs have gone live in production with us. One, Manhattan Industries. And one of the largest networking ISVs in the world have made significant commitments to production and nonproduction workloads that are now live on our Cloud. We beat AWS head-to-head on price, performance and breadth of services for these wins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s a little bit of mention of AT&amp;T. I thought I\u2019d give you an update on AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T, of course, is moving thousands of terabytes of data to the Cloud. We have begun to migrate thousands of these databases as we speak. We expect within the fiscal year to have the AT&amp;T data centers all connected to the Oracle Cloud, migrating this massive dataset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect this, of course, to be the first of many that we\u2019ve started to sign in Q4. I mentioned a couple of the ISVs, but the importance of the progress is to be noted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a few numbers to close up. In the apps ecosystem, 91% now of our trailing 12-month revenue is recurring. The apps ecosystem is now bigger than $11 billion. It\u2019s up 11% year-over-year, and as I think a year ago, I mentioned that I expected our apps ecosystem to grow roughly double-digits. It did. It did a little better than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re growing faster than the market, and while I list all of these wins, most of these wins that I list are not coming from our user base. Our user base, while heavily now represented in our pipeline - Larry had a very important announcement last week - but it is still not the bulk of what is in our Cloud and that opportunity is yet ahead of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some numbers on SaaS. Overall ERP and HCM revenue was $2.2 billion for the year. Fusion Apps, up 62% for the year. Fusion ERP was up 60% organically, 68% for the year. Fusion HCM was up 72% for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to make sure I say this number carefully. NetSuite bookings in the quarter were up 62% in constant-currency. This reflects the investment we\u2019ve made in go-to-market that we started a year ago that began to reflect itself in performance in the back half of the year. This will lead to accelerated NetSuite revenue in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our tech ecosystem is now greater than $21 billion and up 5% for the year, with the database ecosystem up 6% and accelerating in Q4 with an exit growth rate of 7%. BYOL is clearly resonating with customers. Q4 database new license revenue was up 9%, and autonomous database is now beginning to show up in our pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re pleased to do license revenue for our key database options which are necessary to run the autonomous database. We\u2019re up mid-teens in the quarter. Our next-generation PaaS grew 45% for the year, with now total revenue of $1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll close by just saying I think we\u2019re executing well on now what is a growing pipeline in both apps and autonomous database with 5% top line growth and 14% EPS growth in FY 2018. To Safra\u2019s point, looking forward into FY 2019, revenue growth is expected to be higher than FY 2018 and EPS will grow double-digits for the year again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Ellison</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve just about finished enabling all of our SaaS, PaaS and IaaS Cloud Services to run alongside each other in our new second-generation bare metal data centers. This consolidation of all three categories of Cloud Services, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS, into a single standard data center allows us to share access while giving us significant economies of scale. As a result, we expect continued expansion of our Cloud margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But just as important, to have SaaS, PaaS and IaaS in the same data center makes it easier for our Fusion customers to extend those SaaS applications using our latest PaaS and IaaS technologies and capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As an example, we recently demonstrated how one of our customers used our mobile service, our Cloud mobile service, our Cloud voice service and our Cloud machine learning service to extend our Fusion HCM system with an Amazon Alexa voice interface for vacation requests and vacation approvals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve developed these new technologies, machine learning, voice and mobile, so we could voice-enable all of our applications, and we\u2019re putting those voice systems, a combination of chat box, voice, all machine learning driven, we\u2019re putting those voice interfaces as the next generation of our UI for Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The technologies that we use to add the voice interfaces to Fusion HCM and Fusion ERP are available as PaaS services in our Cloud to our customers. So if there\u2019s something they want to add to Fusion ERP or HCM they could do it using the same tools we use to build the applications in the first place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think that\u2019s a big deal. We think having SaaS, PaaS and IaaS all integrated together in the same data center is the key differentiator between Oracle and our Cloud competitors, most of whom are focused primarily on SaaS only or primarily on IaaS only.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I guess we open it up for questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Larry. Operator, if you\u2019ll please start preparing the audience for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, and congrats on a nice Q4. Mark, I think it\u2019s fair to say everyone\u2019s very surprised by 9% database license growth in the quarter. I want to make sure I heard that right and that overall database ecosystem growth accelerated in Q4, and this is even without autonomous database fully available just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So my question, how much of this is just customers purchasing ahead and buying into the strategic roadmap or are there other factors we should consider?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all, you\u2019ve got those numbers right so I\u2019m glad because that means I said them right. And we did see acceleration in the quarter and I think it\u2019s all of the above. And again, it\u2019s back to the point of we\u2019ve had good demand sort of across-the-board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the other point I tried to make, and I went through the numbers relatively quickly, was the option number. The option number in the quarter was mid-double digits. The necessary options to enable autonomous database and I think, Brad, that\u2019s, again, a key number. And back to the fact that this represents to us whether that shows up in Cloud revenue or license revenue. You see it start to show up in both numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, we had a really cool win in the quarter that I just ran out of time to mention at Ford. Ford was literally a BYOL customer or a BYOL transaction in the context of it was a combination license deal and Cloud deal in the sense of Cloud the way we would have historically reported Cloud revenue at the same time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, you\u2019re just, Brad, beginning to see the beginning of autonomous database. While we\u2019ve been talking about it, we went really GA with autonomous database, data warehouse in the beginning of Q4. So it\u2019s just beginning to show up in our pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to all of your points, the numbers in Q4 show numerically the progress and certainly what we begin to see now in our pipelines now that the technology is literally rolling out. We\u2019re in hundreds and hundreds of trials and proof-of-concepts and those are, of course, the beginning stage of all of this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So yes, we\u2019re pretty encouraged and certainly the fact it showed up in Q4 numbers is encouraging as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just a quick follow up for Safra. Safra, it\u2019s great to see double-digit EPS growth back on the table for fiscal 2019. Can you just remind us what your assumptions are that get you there, particularly on the buyback? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t usually give guidance on the buyback, but we view our stock as very inexpensive and we view it as something in the range of where we\u2019ve been lately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian with Macquarie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sarah Hindlian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is for Larry. Larry, we\u2019re just talking about it and 2018 is clearly rolling out. But the one thing I want to understand better - I\u2019d like to understand a little bit better customer demand and adoption trends too, but I\u2019d also like to hear a little bit about how more regular annual database updates versus what I would consider, historically to be more large and monolithic upgrades. If that can actually change any software-buying patterns of the customer and if that\u2019s something you\u2019re starting to see or thinking about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, let\u2019s see. I think we used to have - let\u2019s say a few years ago you could expect a major database release every 2.5 years, something like that was the cycle. Clearly, where - and when a new database release came out, that often spurred a certain degree of buying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, keep in mind, we still have a major database release coming out periodically, but it\u2019s going to come out - because of the Cloud now, it comes out a bit more frequently, and a lot of the autonomous features are being added very rapidly. For example, we came out with - I guess, we went GA - as Mark pointed out, GA and autonomous database at the beginning of Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will have our simple trends autonomous transactional OLTP system, we will call \u2013 or a combination of OLTP and data warehouse integrated coming out in the next month, or so. And then, a couple months after that, we\u2019re going to have the high-performance, high-reliability OLTP system coming out. So some of the autonomous features are coming out at a more rapid rate than some of the more mature features in the database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Those features that are aimed primarily at the Cloud are going to be delivered at a higher rate. I hope that answers your question, than we have historically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a question to the team here. On the Q1 call, you talked about the legacy IaaS business versus the new IaaS business. And then, on the Q3 call, you talked about legacy SaaS versus the newer SaaS products. And, Mark, obviously, you gave some color on the newer ones in your prepared remarks. But hoping you\u2019d just give us a little more detail, sort of just the trends that you\u2019re seeing there called new versus legacy IaaS and SaaS, and how you\u2019re thinking about sort of the crisscross points there with the newer businesses that are growing quickly sort of get big enough and keep growing fast enough to sort of offset whatever you\u2019re seeing on the legacy front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is that for me or for Mark?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jump ball.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I\u2019m taller, so I\u2019ll start. But I think you hit it right, Phil. I mean, listen. Just to give you an example, I gave you two wins I named Manhattan and a new ISV that\u2019s I think I used the term big networking company. That\u2019s a brand new app to the Oracle Cloud. Brand new. Remember brand new app to Oracle, let me start with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">App wasn\u2019t running on Oracle. We moved it to Oracle, as well to the Oracle Cloud. So you have a couple of different dynamics here. Yeah. There\u2019s some legacy stuff and what you would have think of as the traditional reporting that we use, but we\u2019re in the top of the first inning of all this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To Larry\u2019s point, we released Autonomous database in April. It\u2019s showing up in trials and POCs, not in the numbers even that you\u2019re seeing here. We\u2019re getting new ISV wins that are just net-new to Oracle in addition to bringing our existing customers to Oracle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, again, we\u2019re in the law of small numbers here, relative to the entire company that have tremendous upside here, but the key thing for us has been getting our products in the market. The next generation I mentioned, I gave you a statistic on the 45% growth rate in our next-gen PaaS Infrastructure business for the year, and that\u2019s obviously the next-gen of it, and that\u2019s at the very embryonic stage, Phil, of the beginning of this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And these wins are now just these trials and POCs. The example of the ISVs, they\u2019ve yet to really just to start to produce revenue, because you got to start with the work and then you start moving production. And, in fact, Manhattan has already moved \u2013 just begun to move a couple of their customers to the Oracle Cloud as part of this. So we\u2019re at the very early phase of this, and the lines will cross, obviously, relatively soon here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs and Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask a little bit about BYOL and Oracle Cloud infrastructure. And Mark and Larry, I know you guys touched on this a little bit in your prepared remarks, but can you give us a sense of where we are in the migration to BYOL? And I guess in particular, can you give us a sense of the momentum within your enterprise accounts using these technology rights in the Cloud, and how do you see the slope of this adoption curve as you look ahead?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think, again, maybe the most interesting fact in the quarter was our very largest deal in terms of a new license purchase was we know the intent of this particular customer, and the intent was to deploy 100% of it in the Cloud immediately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re seeing, you know, I guess we\u2019ve mentioned AT&amp;T 35 times now on the call as an example. But they\u2019re an example of one of our largest customers that really has an intent to move the majority of their Oracle data into the Cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s just a gigantic one, but AT&amp;T is unusual because they\u2019re such a \u2013 that\u2019s such a large \u2013 it has so many large Oracle databases. But many of our other customers, now that we have BYOL, can move their Oracle database license from on-premise into our Cloud and they just pay basically for the incremental infrastructure cost and they continue paying support on what becomes a Cloud License. That\u2019s a very attractive value proposition for our customers, and we see large numbers of our largest customers very interested in beginning that migration process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can I double-click on licenses again? You had tough comps because Q4 last year was strong on licenses, so \u2013 and I know last quarter, you kind of talked about some delays on the apps on the vertical apps side. So can you talk a little bit about like how we got to the number that we have there now between Bring Your Own Licenses but also how it played out on the apps side? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, without sounding trite, we just sold more. And I think at the end, it\u2019s a combination of what we said. I mean, you\u2019re exactly right. Q4 last year was a very good strong quarter for us, so it was, if you will, a tough comp. But to Safra\u2019s opening comments, the quarter was strong for us really across every line. I mean, the only thing that really hurt us in the quarter to be honest with you if you looked at the income statement was currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We went in expecting to get 3 points. We got 2 points. We wound up beating on top of that, and so it was just a solid quarter. And I don\u2019t really have any, Raimo, discrete stories to tell you to give you more flavor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously, the database ecosystem was strong, and clearly, the options within \u2013 we accelerated database growth in the quarter. Database options within the context of a \u2013 particularly those that enable autonomous data warehouse were strong in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our apps license did decline in the quarter. We expected that, but frankly, it was actually relatively stable, so \u2013 if you will, because the user base is still the scale that it is, our apps license was a decline but better than I expected within the context of that decline, if that makes sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so it just \u2013 obviously the quality of the brands on the bookings side, which don\u2019t show up in actually the income statement, was just \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say it was unexpected, it was just pleasant to see it all come through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I just want to double-click on the NetSuite booking. The NetSuite booking, while it is what we hoped, it\u2019s so great to see because it\u2019s been such a fabulous acquisition for us. The team has done a great job. We\u2019ve invested, and it showed up numerically in the bookings and that\u2019ll show up in the revenue as we go forward in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as I go through the quarter \u2013 and we haven\u2019t mentioned our expense structure. We\u2019ve got a lot of leverage there as well, and so just as I look through the lines just from an operating perspective, it was a very solid quarter. Maybe more than you wanted in your question, Raimo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, also, we - Raimo, let me just add, we launched BYOL at the very end of Q2, and this really opened up a lot of ULAs and PULAs for our customers who are very interested in being able to deploy in the Cloud and on-premise. It\u2019s particularly of value to them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so there are literally billions of dollars involved in these agreements and it\u2019s many, many customers, it is very widespread and it really shows up in Q4. And shows up in all the quarters, but of course after BYOL, it really showed up in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Kirk?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Kirk, we can\u2019t hear you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ken Bond</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Kirk, going once. Twice. Operator, next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think this is probably a question for either Mark or for Larry. Can you talk a little bit about how customer demand for database in the Cloud is evolving both for new workloads and for existing workloads and how the balance is working out by whether or not they\u2019re choosing BYOL or database as a service?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, they\u2019re overwhelmingly - at least - again, it\u2019s early days because BYOL has only been around a couple of quarters. It\u2019s overwhelmingly BYOL because - for new workloads and for shifting existing workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, Oracle has - a majority of the world\u2019s databases are Oracle databases. We\u2019re larger than IBM and Microsoft combined who are second and third and we have a lot more to - and we have much bigger databases than they have and all of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So there\u2019s just a huge inventory of information inside of these databases and these - and we have huge customers with - that own licenses for all of this stuff and they want to move - not move all of it at once.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, AT&amp;T has actually made a commitment to move all of it in a relatively short-term. Other customers are moving, but not as rapidly. And they are buying additional options for their existing licenses so they can move into the Cloud and take advantage of autonomous services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me \u2013 let me explain the situation. So you want \u2013 you want to move 10% of your databases from on-premise into the Cloud and you want to use the autonomous database. Well the autonomous database requires that you have the multi-tenant option and the real application cluster option. So you might have database - you might have some database licenses, but you might not have licensed those options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you go ahead and enter into a ULA or PULA, one of these large license agreements. You add these additional options and maybe additional database licenses. And then when you have those additional options, you then - that makes it possible for you to take advantage of the autonomous database services. But if you don\u2019t want to use the autonomous services, you can still move your database into our Cloud. You just don\u2019t get the autonomous features.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But most people are very excited about the autonomous features because it at once lowers labor costs and secondly, dramatically improves security and reliability because there\u2019s no pilot error, there\u2019s no opportunity for mischief by taking out the labor. So not only do you save a lot of money by eliminating the labor. Again, you have a much more secure and much more reliable system. No pilot error, no mischief.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So they\u2019re entering into these ULAs, they\u2019re buying additional options and then they\u2019re moving their licenses over. We\u2019ve been at this for a very, very long time. New workloads. All of the new workloads of that \u2013 for any given year is small compared to the 25, 30 years of inventory of data that we\u2019ve accumulated since we\u2019ve been in this business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, overwhelmingly existing databases, not new workloads. Overwhelmingly, BYOL as opposed to-database services. Now, we\u2019re getting some very exciting new workloads. Don\u2019t get me wrong. The new workloads are very important to us. There are lots of cool start-ups and we\u2019re going after those aggressively and we\u2019re getting a lot of those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I know Mark mentioned earlier that a lot of our customers - a lot of our new customers in the Cloud are not existing Oracle customers. So, obviously, those are new workloads, and we\u2019re getting a lot of those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But you said where is the majority of it? The majority of it is inside of our install base. They\u2019re reusing their existing licenses. They\u2019re buying additional options. They\u2019re moving it to the Autonomous database in the Oracle Cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our final question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies and Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And my question, I think, is probably best fit for Safra. So, Safra, we understand how the separation of Cloud and on-premise sales sort of gets blurred with the flexibility you allow your customers with BYOL. So I think from a high level, we all understand why you changed the way you report. But how do you get investors comfortable that this also is not obfuscating any Cloud weakness?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Especially, when I look - and I know we don\u2019t have a long-term deferred revenue, but the deferred revenue looks a little bit - it was below what we were looking for. I\u2019m just trying to anticipate questions I\u2019m going to be hit with tomorrow. And, frankly, looking at your stock, I mean, when you put the headline numbers, the stock popped, and I know you may not be looking at it minute-by-minute. But then, when the details came out, it actually dropped. So I think that might be one of the reasons anyway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So let\u2019s cover everything. So first of all, there is no hiding. I told you the Cloud number, 1.7 billion. You can do the math. You see we are right where we said we\u2019d be. No surprises. Margins up sequentially shows business is doing well. Cloud billings strong. Nice and strong. You can hear that. You can hear it from what we\u2019re talking about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as net deferrals, gross deferrals are actually up 5%. So this is just a collections thing with timing, and you\u2019ll see that quarter-to-quarter, especially Q1 from Q4. So this is nothing surprise here. We don\u2019t have any bad news.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fact, what we\u2019re telling you is in fact that the way to understand our business better, especially with so many customers taking licenses and support that licenses that are supported that we were counting and calling on-premise when in fact they are not deploying them on-premise. It would be - it\u2019s simply not so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, we want to explain to you and make sure you understand and have enough understanding of the business to see that our customers are both buying licenses and using licenses they have, which are currently being recorded as on-premise support. They\u2019re using those, in fact, in the Cloud, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s, of course, what they were designed for, frankly, and what we\u2019re very excited about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think, between all of the information I\u2019ve given you, it\u2019s quite clear that we had a superb quarter and we\u2019re expecting the same next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But if you could, just remind us when you refer to gross deferrals versus net deferrals. And I know that you, Oracle, is probably more conservative than I think any company we cover in your reporting of deferred revenue. But if you could hit that quickly, that\u2019d be great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I mean, from the gross deferrals, what we do is we subtract the uncollected, which is, obviously, a very big number at the end of Q4. Think about it. So that\u2019s all that\u2019s going on there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, just Mark. To add, there is just no story in the gross short-term deferral. I mean, this is a nothing burger, and I\u2019m telling you that the gross deferrals were right on where we thought. There\u2019s just nothing here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the Press Release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for closing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for joining today's Oracle fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call.
