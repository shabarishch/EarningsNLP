Now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Senior Vice President.</p> <p><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Erica. Good afternoon, everyone.

We'll begin with a few prepared remarks, and then I'll turn the call over to Safra. Safra?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Safra Catz</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Ken. And good afternoon, everyone. We are again, reporting earnings 10 days after the end of the fiscal quarter, faster than any other company in the S&amp;P 500. Fusion Cloud ERP enables us to understand our business performance sooner and with greater insight, which is an advantage our customers are rapidly beginning to appreciate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see, we had a great quarter and executed well against our growth plan. Revenue was in line with our USD guidance while EPS beat the mid-point of guidance by $0.05.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $7.3 billion, up 5% in U.S. dollars, 2% in constant currency, driven by Fusion, Autonomous Database and our Gen2 OCI cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recurring revenue, as a percentage of total revenue now represents 72% of total company revenue and we anticipate this trend to continue as cloud services grow. Application subscription revenues were $3 billion up 5% in U.S. dollars, 3% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strategic back-office cloud applications now have annualized revenue of $4 billion and grew 24% this quarter, including Fusion ERP up 27%, NetSuite ERP up 22% and Fusion HCM up 21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Infrastructure subscription revenues were $4.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars, up 2% in constant currency. Infrastructure cloud services now have an annualized revenue of more than $2 billion, including OCI consumption revenue, which was up 123%; autonomous database was up 55%; cloud customer consumption revenue was up over 200%, but on small numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Database subscription revenues, including database support and database cloud services, were up 6% in U.S. dollars and up 3% in constant currency. License revenues were $1.3 billion, up 4% in U.S. dollars and unchanged in constant currency. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $10.1 billion, up 3% in U.S. dollars, up slightly in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating expenses were down this quarter. And non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion, up 6% from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Q3 operating margin was 47% in USD, up 300 basis points from 44% last year, and our best Q3 results in more than 10 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.7% slightly below our base tax rate, as a result of some discrete items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">EPS was a $1.16 in U.S. dollars up 20% in U.S. dollars, up 16% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP EPS was a $1.68 in U.S. dollars, up 113% and up 104% in constant currency. In the quarter, the GAAP income statement was impacted by a one-time net tax benefit of approximately $2.3 billion related to the transfer of certain assets between subsidiaries. To facilitate comparison across periods, we have excluded the effect of this event from our non-GAAP calculation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.7 billion with capital expenditures of $1.9 billion and free cash flow in excess of $12.8 billion over the same period. For the quarter operating cash flow was $3.7 billion up 23% and free cash flow was $3.3 billion up 26% from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now have nearly $36 billion in cash and marketable security. The short-term deferred revenue balance was down in constant currency at $8.1 billion, while the short-term gross deferred revenue was up 4% in constant currency. As you know, the difference between the two growth rates is due entirely to timing differences in customer payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The remaining performance obligation or RPO balance is $35.3 billion, up 2% in constant currency versus last year. Approximately 61% is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months, up from 60% a year ago. As we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In this quarter we repurchased more than 64 million shares for a total of 4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividends, 33% from $0.24 to $0.32 per share. The Board of Directors also authorized an additional $20 billion for the repurchase of Oracle shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned last quarter, we experienced capacity constraints for OCI cloud services as customer workloads expanded dramatically. In addition, we continue to land many new customers, including ISVs, and we have some very large users coming online shortly that will require significant amounts of capacity. As a result, we're investing aggressively this quarter, this Q4, both OpEx and CapEx to prepare for this increase in cloud consumption and associated revenue in FY2022. As such, we are going to target a 49% operating margin for Q4. This will enable us to continue to deliver double digit earnings growth, once again, in FY2022 for the fifth year in a row.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to the guidance. Again, my guidance today is on a non-GAAP basis and assumes current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, which is a 4% positive effect on total revenue and $0.07 positive effect on EPS in Q4. It may look like a positive effect of $0.08 to EPS due to rounding, but it's $0.07. However, actual currency impacts could be different [so here it goes] [ph]. Total revenues are expected to grow from 5% to 7% in U.S. dollars and are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency. Cloud services and license support will grow faster than in Q3, as well as strategic back-office cloud applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result of the increased investment in the quarter, non-GAAP EPS in USD is expected to grow 7% to 11% and be between a $1.28 and a $1.32 in USD. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be flat to up 4% and be between a $1.20 and a $1.24 in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">CapEx for Q4 is expected to be $1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My EPS guidance for Q4 assumes a base rate of 19%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary, but I expect that normalizing for these one-time tax events, our tax rate will average around 19% or so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry for his comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Ellison</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Safra. Three months ago, Bob Evans posted an article on the Cloud Wars\u2019 website in which he quotes SAP, CFO, Luka Mucic making the following statement at an investors conference. And I quote, \u201cI have checked and we have not lost a single ERP customer to Oracle.\u201d In other words, after personally, checking SAP\u2019s Chief Financial Officer could not find a single example of an SAP ERP customer move into Oracle Fusion on ERP, not one. Perhaps he should have checked a little bit more carefully.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Q3 alone we signed contracts, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to migrate several very large SAP ERP customers, to Oracle Fusion ERP. But this was not just a recent Q3 event. This has been going on for a couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'm now going to go and present a list of over a 100 companies and government agencies that have already moved from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, or currently in the process of doing so. I've divided the list of SAP customers who are moving to Oracle Fusion ERP into two distinct groups. I want to be very precise here. The first group is moving their entire company to the fusion ERP suite, including core financials, it's Oracle wall-to-wall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second group has started deploying Fusion ERP applications, but has not yet put in the entire suite and may still be running SAP financials in some places. They have begun the migration, but they are not committed to doing the entire suite as yet, or they are not in the process of doing the entire suite as yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So let me go to start the list.

They are the largest private company in Belgium. And they completely replaced SAP R/3 and they thought the cost of moving to S/4HANA and the cloud was much too high and they instead went with Oracle Fusion ERP. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">TICO Logistica, a logistics company in Latin America had SAP \u2013 had SAP replaced with Oracle ERP at the end of the sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">FedEx, FedEx had SAP ERP in some places and Oracle ERP in some places.

They are a huge European \u2013 North American and European manufacturer of ATMs and they\u2019ve replaced out all of SAP and the German subsidiary BOSSY throughout the world and they standardized on Fusion ERP, SCM and HCM and they have added Oracle Performance Management, Fusion Performance Management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s see. Another company whose name they don\u2019t want to be mentioned, let\u2019s see, they are a high-tech manufacturer in North America.

Now I want to go onto the second group \u2013 second group of companies and these are companies that had started putting in Oracle Fusion modules but have yet \u2013 they have not replaced core financials as yet. So they\u2019re buying our supply chain. They\u2019re buying our procurement, They\u2019re buying our transportation management. They\u2019re buying our global trade management. But they have not yet bought Oracle Financials. So I want to be very specific that they are buying lots and lots of Fusion products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GN Airlines, Apollo Tyres, Achema, an adhesive solutions company in the UK, Aarhus Kommune, their municipality in Central Denmark, Caesars Enterprise Services, they have an idea \u2013 they bought Procurement in Supply Chain, a big hospitality company obviously in North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sheppard Danaher a product lifecycle management, they are a healthcare company.

Dove bought supply chain management and transportation management.

News America Marketing, Orlando International, PG&amp;E, Porcelanosa, Republic Services, SAC Wireless and Nokia Company, Samsonite, Puma, Santander Bank, Therma-Tru Doors. Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am going to stop right there or I\u2019ll take up all of the time you won\u2019t be able to ask Safra questions. Okay. I don\u2019t want to do that. Okay. All right. So again, the list is actually longer than 100-plus companies. I did read over 100 companies as I\u2019m sure you painfully aware of. List is actually longer than the 100 companies I have just read. Some are most important wins and are very largest companies in regulated industries such as banking and utilities who are currently in the process of migrating from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP, prefer not to be publicly named on this call for obvious reasons. They don\u2019t \u2013 even though they are often a reference for us, private reference where people are considering the same move, they don\u2019t want to be on \u2013 their name on this call, because they want to maintain the best possible relations with SAP as they \u2013 even though they are in the process of transitioning away from SAP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. So I\u2019d like to make one last point and then turn it back over to Safra. Specifically trying to answer one key question. How come so many customers are moving from SAP ERP to Fusion ERP? This has never happened before. A major migration between ERP vendors. Well, if you want to know the answer read the Gartner report comparing Oracle ERP to SAP ERP. Please don\u2019t take my word for it. Read the report, it\u2019s very short and it\u2019s to the point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front, I mean far \u2013 you can find a magic quadrant where there is more a bigger gap between number one and number two. And so, Gartner ranks Oracle Fusion ERP far in front of all the other cloud ERP systems. But what\u2019s surprising is SAP isn\u2019t number two. SAP is at number three. SAP is listed among the leaders. SAP is listed among the lagger. Gartner \u2013 if you read the text, Gartner points out, and I quote, SAP\u2019s own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to read that again. \u201cSAP\u2019s own reference customers scored SAP in the lower half of cloud ERP vendors.\u201d SAP, the once-dominant on-premise ERP market leader is currently not competitive in the cloud ERP market. How could that has happened because SAP never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud. It\u2019s that same with 30-year-old code. They never rewrote their ERP system for the cloud and it\u2019s too late for them to start now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'll turn it back over to Safra.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Larry. Erica, if you could please pull the audience for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Turits with KeyBanc Capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Larry, thanks for all the color on ERP. I'd like to switch over to your database. You've made meaningful improvements in both cloud customer and OCI too which both one of the two are required for ADB. So, are those improvements enough that we're now starting to see the upgrades to ADB? And are you able to monetize those upgrades to the point where we'll start to see database growth acceleration?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The answer is I think there's no question. You're going to see a lot of database growth \u2013 a lot of database acceleration starting next year which we're a quarter away from. But we'll be fine in Q4. Again, its autonomous databases is growing pretty rapidly. But we expect it really to explode next year. And I really do mean very, very rapid growth next year. I'm not really ready to disclose our plans as to why I think it's going to suddenly spike but we expect very, very rapid database growth next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Larry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Murphy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi Larry. This SAP replacement wave, feels like kind of a historic moment because that kind of activity it's usually so rare and these are the logos are pretty large that you're mentioning. So when we see\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I acknowledge for interrupting. The really spectacular logos [indiscernible] there's some of them are pretty spectacular on there. But we have some that are much larger and much \u2013 and absolutely shocking. I've been alluding to these, but sometimes we're in the middle of an 18-month implementation. And the customer doesn't want any mention. If I could mention them all, it would be \u2013 it\u2019s front page news. I mean it's a very big deal. Yes. I agree with you. It's an historic event. It is \u2013 I think a long time ago, I said there are two technologies that will drive Oracle's future, one is the autonomous database and the other is ERP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are \u2013 reading the Gartner report, we are so dominant. Our product is so much better than anyone else's product in the cloud. We expect to get a significant number more than half of SAP's customers we\u2019ll get. But keeping our own, yes, plus getting a lot of it from the smaller companies like M4 and Lawson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Murphy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Larry, the ones that we see, which aren't too savvy, you mentioned DHL and Honda and Lloyds Bank. Is that a precursor to moving to Oracle core financials eventually. And I'm just wondering which of Oracle strength is really catalyzing that wave of replacements?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So there are two lists. One, the first half of the list that I read and they're about equal sized lists where people that are already moved from SAP financials to Oracle financials. The second list where people that had partially moved to Oracle, but still were running SAP financials in some places. In other words, we don't consider it a complete win until we replace out. If we just sell procurement and supply chain and manufacturing and things like that, but they still run SAP financials we don't consider that a complete win. That's what we call our surround strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But once you start using our cloud products and compare that with SAPs on premise products, we think the vast majority of these companies that it started the journey, we'll finish the journey. And they'll want financials in the cloud, just like they have supply chain in the cloud, in procurement in the cloud. So yes, we expect company \u2013 we've already seen companies migrate off the second list. They buy procurement, they buy supply chain and they see, okay, I like that. And I'm going to buy financials. So yes, we expect all of those or excuse me, the vast majority of those customers to eventually standardize on Fusion Cloud ERP for everything. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Murphy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Thank you very much for taking my question and appreciate the additional color that Safra you gave on the call. I'd like to turn to OCI Gen2. We've been hearing about security concerns from consumer internet companies. To what extent has OCI security technology helped you in business with these companies and is consumer internet a big driver for OCI Gen2, also to be clear, this is not about TikTok, it's that all the other consumer internet company opportunities. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well I think there are two things that are interesting about OCI. One on the security front. One is we believe security should be always be turned on and in other words, there is no light switch, security on, security off. We have these things called max security zones in OCI where you cannot turn security off and max security is always turned on. It's a safe place to go inside of OCI. No one has anything like this, where security is always turned on. You cannot turn it off. You cannot open up a link \u2013 a network link that puts your infrastructure and your data in jeopardy. That's one thing. So security is always on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second thing is autonomy is very interesting, because the Oracle autonomous database, by the way, the Oracle autonomous database is not the only autonomous product we have. We have autonomous Linux that is the foundation of OCS, the foundation operating system inside of the OCI network. Oracle autonomous, Linux, Oracle autonomous database has no human labor associated with them. Okay. So everyone says, well, that's a huge cost saving. It is, but that's not the most important benefit. The most important benefit if there is no human labor, there is no human error. If there's no human labor, there's no human mission, there's no opportunity for an insider to corrupt the system. There's no opportunity for a user to misconfigure a system that creates a security vulnerability that will lead to the loss of data. So, we think one of the most attractive aspects of OCI, other than its high performance, low cost, all of that, everyone likes to pay less and they do with OCI. But we do a better job of securing your data than any other cloud vendor. We've seen that be the decisive feature in winning a lot of these deals with ISVs and end user customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I appreciate it. Thank you for the additional color.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong quarter. I just wanted to focus in on the license line it was up 4% as reported to be a flat constant currency off of what was actually the toughest comp for this fiscal year. Wondering if you can provide some context of sort of what is driving that particularly sort of relative to the strength that you are also seeing in the cloud side? Is this the Oracle database, is this the add-ons to the Oracle database? Any sort of more color there. And then also in particular in sort of in conjunction with the cloud, that'd be great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me take that. So the Oracle database remains very strong and what's good about the Oracle database is you can also bring your own license to the cloud. So it's both on-premise and in the cloud can be used there. And it remains very, very strong. The installed base of the Oracle database continues to grow. And that is of course our central piece.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, in addition, Java on-premise continues to do very well as more and more companies continue to invest in Java and trust Java for their own applications. And in addition, our vertical applications, some of our industry applications still require on-premise license for the customers\u2019 use. We also have cloud services in many of these verticals, but especially in telecommunications, as many of the communications companies move to 5G, we are a very central part of their transition to 5G and need our license in those areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So database tops, doing incredibly well, Java doing very, very well and our vertical applications. And then pretty much everything else of course as you know is offered just in the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you very much for the color. Appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our final question comes from Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. And congrats as well on a great quarter. Larry, it's so great to hear every single one of those SAP wins, especially since investors think of SAP's customer relationships as being so deep. So clearly by displacing them in so many accounts, it speaks volumes to the quality of your product and trust that these companies place with Oracle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, my question is this, why now, and why from a product perspective, you mentioned Gartner's take, but since Oracle has always competed on having better products, what have you been doing product wise that's enabled you to pull ahead of them like this and what do you need to continue to do product wise to remain ahead?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So well we started 10 years ago to build fusion financials for the cloud to rewrite all \u2013 PeopleSoft ERP, JD Edwards ERP, and of course, Oracle E-Business Suite, we had these three separate on-premise ERP systems, and we decided a decade ago to rewrite all of that with the cloud. And SAP unbelievably, they just, I mean \u2013 and we did a very good job. We started a decade ago and we did, I think, a very good job redoing a big job, to say the least, redoing our ERP products for the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That said, SAP chose not to rewrite their ERP products. Instead, they made a bunch of acquisitions. They bought Concur, they bought Ariba, they bought SuccessFactors, but they never \u2013 and we made some acquisitions also by the way, [indiscernible] and others right now at other things. But we rewrote everything for the cloud. SAP instead, embedded their own database called HANA and focused on this new database and never really rewrote their ERP code for the cloud. I mean, it's just an unbelievable error.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They worked on a new database and the, the thing we're competing with at so-called S/4HANA in the cloud, is what the SAP calls it, is not a cloud product at all. It is the 35-year-old ABAP, this is written in a programming language called ABAP. Oracle Fusion is written entirely in Java. And it's been entirely rewritten overload over the last decade. SAP stuff is literally 30 years old. The same that they've always had, that they now will host for you. So I would say we did a competent job rewriting for the cloud, SAP just entirely missed the boat. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So SAP really is more responsible for our leadership position than we are. Again, they never rewrote their application for the cloud. It's unbelievable what's happened. And their customers are noticing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We offer a new release of our ERP system every 90 days. We offer new features and functions. That's how the cloud works. You are on the cloud, you get new features and functions, you are on this 90-day cadence. We give you more features and more capabilities every 90 days. SAP has nothing like that. It's not a cloud system. It's simply is okay, you can get the SAP S/4HANA and you can get it hosted by somebody, but they don't even have a cloud. They never built a cloud. That's what happened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Larry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s amazing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Larry. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for the next 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. And we look forward to speaking with you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for joining us today. With that, I will turn the call back to Erica for closing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for joining today's Oracle's third quarter of 2021 earnings conference call.
