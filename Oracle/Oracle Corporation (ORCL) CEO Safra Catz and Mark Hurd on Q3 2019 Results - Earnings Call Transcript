And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Safra Catz</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll first go over Q3 results before moving on to guidance. I\u2019ll then<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> turn the call over to Mark and Larry.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As in prior quarters, I\u2019ll review our non-GAAP results using constant dollar growth rates unless I say otherwise. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $6.7 billion, up 4% in constant currency and now accounts for nearly 70% of total company revenue, largely recurring revenue. As in past quarters, we are seeing robust double-digit growth rates for total cloud revenue in all regions, with especially strong growth in Asia-Pacific.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of product categories, ERP grew in the mid-30s and the verticals grew in the high-30s. Our Software business, which is the totaling of cloud services and license support revenue with cloud license and on-premise license revenue, is 82% of total revenue and it grew 3% in constant currency. Our Software business has remained extremely stable and resilient as we have made the transition to faster growing SaaS business that entailed trading nonrecurring upfront license revenue for recurring long-term subscription revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through adoption of Autonomous Database and OCI, we are now shifting the focus for infrastructure business to the cloud. As a percentage of our total software business, cloud is now more than double what it was just three years ago and provides us with the ability to accelerate overall software revenue growth as this mix shift continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP applications total revenue were $2.8 billion, up 7% and GAAP infrastructure total revenues were $5.1 billion, up 2%. Gross margin for cloud services and license support was 86%, essentially the same as last year, with continuing improvement in SaaS gross margins, stability in software support gross margins and continued investment in Oracle cloud infrastructure. Once our Cloud business is at scale, I expect our gross margins will go significantly higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.3 billion, up 5% from last year. And the operating margin was 44%, up from 43% last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter last year was greatly impacted by the change in the U.S. tax law, so comparing the GAAP numbers is not very meaningful after pretax income. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20%, up from 16% catch-up rate last year and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87 and up 12% in constant currency. This quarter the GAAP tax rate was 11% and GAAP EPS was $0.76.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow over last four quarters is $14.8 billion. Over the last four quarters, capital expenditures were $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $13.2 billion, down 1% due to timing differences of tax payments and working capital items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have more than $40 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8 billion, up 5% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The remaining performance obligations, or what I\u2019ll refer to as contract backlog, will be in the Q and is now $31.5 billion, of which approximately 62% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Since we remain committed to returning value to shareholders through acquisitions, internal investments and a return of capital with stock repurchases and dividends, this quarter we repurchased 206 million shares for a total of $10 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 728 million shares and reduced the absolute shares outstanding by nearly 16%, and the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend 26% from $0.19 to $0.24 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to currency. I expect the strengthening U.S. dollar will continue with a currency headwind of 3% for Q4 revenue and a $0.03 headwind to earnings per share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So with that, let me turn to the guidance. So for Q4, total revenues are expected to grow 1% to 3% in constant currency and 0% to negative 2% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to grow between 15% to 19% and be between $1.08 and $1.12 in constant currency so we will deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for fiscal year 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Taking into account the $0.03 currency headwind, non-GAAP EPS for Q4 in USD is expected to grow between 12% and 16% and be between $1.05 and $1.09 in USD. My EPS guidance assumes the base tax rate of 20%. However, onetime tax events could cause actual tax rates for any given quarter to vary from our base tax rate. But I expect that a normalizing for onetime tax events, our tax rate will average around 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark for his comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Hurd</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Safra. A solid quarter for us from top to bottom. Total revenue was up 3% in constant currency with. EPS 12%, plus 12% constant currency. In our apps ecosystem, we continued our momentum growing at 7% and that was an acceleration for us and over $11 billion in trailing 12 months revenue and 92% of that is now recurring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to grow revenue faster than market and we have an enormous opportunity ahead of us in ERP and HCM. In terms of SaaS revenue and bookings, Fusion apps were up 35%. By the way, our overall ERP and HCM annualized SaaS revenue is now $2.8 billion. That\u2019s up in the mid-20s. Fusion Apps, 35% up, Fusion ERP revenue was up 47% organically. NetSuite revenue was up 28%. Bookings were up actually even higher in the mid-30s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our vertical revenue was up 38% and our annualized revenue in the verticals is now over $800 million. I\u2019m going to read you a quick quote from IDC and I have to read it precisely or I\u2019ll get cards and letters. So let me just make sure I do this exactly as it\u2019s written. \u201cPer IDC\u2019s latest annual market share results, Oracle is the number one enterprise applications vendor in North America based on market share and revenue, surpassing salesforce.com and SAP.\u201d We\u2019ve seen this momentum building. So this is not any surprise to us, but I think it\u2019s always better when you can see it in real numbers from somebody other than us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me switch briefly to infrastructure. Our GAAP techie co-system was $21 billion on a trailing 12 months basis and Q3 was up 2%. And Autonomous Database, our momentum continues to build. We now have 4,000 new trials that were added in Q3 alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nearly 1,000 paying customers. We\u2019re adding many new customers and we\u2019re seeing great pull-through, with 20% of our Autonomous Data Warehouse trials also using analytics. We have over 35 referenceable customers and we expect to be greater than 100 soon. Cloud customer revenue was up triple digits for the fourth consecutive quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So overall, a solid quarter and we hit our revenue targets and saw 12% EPS growth. Climbing renewal rates gives me the confidence that our Cloud Apps businesses is only going to strengthen from here and going forward begin the visibility we have into the revenue backlog, which Safra touched on a bit earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward, I do expect FY 2020 revenue growth will be higher than FY 2019. And EPS this year will be certainly grow double digits, as Safra mentioned. I\u2019m going to give you a few customer wins as well. Try to give you a flavor for what happened in the quarter for us. Most of these didn\u2019t affect our revenue. Most of these are all really bookings that occurred in the quarter, but I thought I\u2019d give you some context about some people in our user base as well as outside our user base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, comp group in the Netherlands, E-Business Suite migration, master brands cab threats in the U.S., an E-Business Suite migration. Tyson Germany, an E-Business Suite migration. Watson, E-Business Suite migration. I gave you those, a few of those examples. Those are core sort of E-Business engineering company. Core sort of E-Business Suite customers as we see this acceleration of our user base moving to the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had a couple people soft ERP migrations, mutual in the quarter. DePaul University and a slew of wins again, I reference that a lot of the ERP user base that\u2019s out there today is outside of our user base or even our traditional on-premise competitor from, if you will, the old days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On semiconductor, nice win in the quarter. Packaging Corporation of America, again, outside of our user base for the quarter. Eaton, another manufacturer in the Netherlands. I could go on, which in the sake of time I won\u2019t, although I\u2019ll mention Ashford Hospitality. These are, again, outside our user base that are brand-new customers to Oracle in the area of ERP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In HCM, Abu Dhabi airports, ADT, Bloom Bank, Great Canadian gaming, we had a really nice win at a company called the Nova Healthcare. This again was not inside our user base. These were traditional cost where we actually did multi-pillar ERP back office and HCM connected together. So I\u2019ll stop there, in the sake of time, but just a really, again, very impressive set of customers and a good mix of net new logo as well as movement from our user base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had a pretty good quarter with some really quality names on the platform side. Fair Isaac, shared services in Italy, Joanne Stores, some really nice beginnings of what you see as we move to our gen 2 cloud and Autonomous Database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I did want to make a couple quick comments on our growing relationship with The Gap. It was a global retailer. Revenue greater than $16 billion. We\u2019ve been working with The Gap and their transformation to what\u2019s really a multi-cloud environment, but using many, many Oracle technologies and they include really everything we\u2019ve got.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">SaaS, PaaS, delivering innovation, reliability and scalability at every turn and as part of even the things they\u2019re using in the private cloud, those are all really enabled by Exadata and we\u2019re really thrilled to be Gap\u2019s extra tee partner in their effort. That\u2019s a few quick wins for the quarter. So overall good, solid quarter for us on the income statement side, but also in the quality of these bookings that we\u2019re describing or that I\u2019ve been describing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Ellison</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark. Oracle\u2019s future rests on two strategic businesses, cloud applications and cloud infrastructure. The growth in our cloud applications business has been driven by our Fusion suite and NetSuite. Both the Fusion suite of applications and NetSuite are growing very, very rapidly. Mark gave you the numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the names imply, both Fusion and NetSuite with integrated suites of MRI cases, including sales, service, human resources, financials, supply chain and manufacturing applications. No other cloud services provider has such a comprehensive suite of applications covering both the front office and the back office. Most customers want their cloud services provider to make their applications work together. Customers do not like to be responsible for the complex process of integrating lots of different applications, running on lots of different vendor\u2019s clouds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think our integrated suite approach to the cloud applications business is a primary reason for the very rapid growth in our cloud applications market share. The introduction of our gen 2 highly secure infrastructure featuring the Oracle Autonomous Database has been very well received. During Q3, we had nearly 1,000. Over 4,000 active trials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our infrastructure technology is highly differentiated from AWS. Each one of our cloud computers has a separate security processor and memory, insulate customers from intruding upon each other and it also makes our cloud control code inaccessible by customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No other cloud services provider offers this kind of protection across their entire public cloud. The Oracle Autonomous Database is the only database that can respond to a security threat by automatically. No down time is required. No other database has this capability. Oracle technology leadership and cloud infrastructure and database plus our market leadership and cloud applications makes us very optimistic about our future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll turn it back to you, operator. Operator, if we could turn to Q&amp;A portion of the call.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good afternoon. Mark, I wanted to ask a question of you. Last month when we were together at our tech conference you reiterated that this goal, second half 2019, sales growth would accelerate on a constant currency basis versus first half and I\u2019m not trying to be knit picky but I think it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s accelerating much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I was just wondering if anything changed and I also wanted to ask about fiscal 2020 which you just mentioned that fiscal 2020 constant currency revenue growth would be higher than fiscal 2019. I guess what I\u2019m wondering is should we be thinking that that constant currency growth acceleration that you\u2019re referring to for fiscal 2020 is similar to the type of acceleration in the second half of fiscal 2019 or could it be more meaningful? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So let\u2019s go back. I think 2019 will grow faster than 2018 second half is whatever your adjective is around it, grow faster than first half. FY 2020 faster than 2019. When you get in underneath it what are the drivers. At a big level first, our growing businesses are becoming a bigger part of our total than our other businesses. So as an example, just one example, Cloud ERP gets bigger, hardware gets smaller, obviously those have offsetting effects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we have things that attach with that for example, our consulting services business now in on-premise has been declining but our cloud consulting is inclining, as does our overall bookings. So as a result, these just offset each other. Within it, clearly, I\u2019ve given you the numbers on certain parts of our apps as an example of ERP and HCM which are growing substantively. Larry\u2019s comments about Autonomous Database are two huge drivers of growth as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think all those statements, 2019 versus 2018, second half, first half, 2019 to 2020 are all where you\u2019re going to see acceleration of top-line growth in CD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ken Bond</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from John DiFucci with Jeffries &amp; Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. So your aggregate results have been I guess relatively steady might be the right way to characterize it. And during this period, I think investors really appreciate the share buybacks and the dividend, dividend increase this quarter. I guess I want to sort of follow on with that line of thinking, Mark, and this uptick in fiscal 2020 and you talked a lot about your Cloud Apps and we get a lot of information on that but can you talk a little bit about what extent the data base options might be a driver to some of that revenue acceleration and how big is the Middleware business at this point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll start. I\u2019ll let Larry comment also a bit on the options. I think first, just when we get into on the database side, the big move here is to autonomous. I think we tried to give you some numbers of the level of interest. The level of \u2013 the increased interest coming from either end of Q1, early Q2 into Q3 was just \u2013 John, it was just substantive. It won\u2019t he show up in our revenue numbers yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m talking in terms of trials and people testing and now frankly people buying. What we\u2019ve even seen, what\u2019s really nice, people buying something for as much as 15, 20, 25K as their first move into Autonomous Database and even within the quarter making a second purchase that turns into. These are really encouraging early signs for us. And then to the point that you bring up, we just don\u2019t get the database t we get analytics, we get other service that\u2019s come with it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as we continue to convert trials into real usage, real usage into expansion, this becomes a core he key driver as we move forward. I\u2019ll let Larry follow on with other parts of the options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As people use Autonomous Database in the public cloud, they typically got by the multitenant option and the real application cluster option which are required options for Autonomous Database. So there\u2019s no question that the introduction of Autonomous Database and the consumption of Autonomous Database is that accelerates will increase the license purchases of those two options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just the second part of my question, you used talk about middleware and how it was on-premise middleware stuff wasn\u2019t growing, was declining. Can you tell us even just roughly how big that is at this point? You sort of alluded to some of these other businesses that weren\u2019t growing or getting smaller and smaller.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We never break that out, John, so to my knowledge, unless \u2013 I\u2019m not going to break \u2013 I\u2019m not going to start breaking it out today, but clearly, we\u2019re \u2013 middleware is moving if you will from like everything else from on-premise into the cloud. We\u2019ve got a full suite of services in the cloud. But we\u2019re not going to break it out into a discrete business today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can say a couple of parts of middleware are doing quite well. I think it\u2019s a mixed story. I think analytics are doing very well in the cloud. As Mark mentioned, 20% of Autonomous Database goes out with analytics and have had java had a very good quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had one last point. Security is faster growing business as we could have within the context of the Middleware business as well. Again, the problem in middleware, it\u2019s not a thing. It\u2019s multitenant products within it. Like many things we\u2019ve talked about, many things growing fast and things declining simultaneously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong quarter. Just want to build on John\u2019s question there about the reacceleration you had in database. When I think about what really differentiates Oracle and cloud, it\u2019s the gen 2 OCI that we continue to get increasingly positive data points on and then also adding autonomous platform on top of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is with the autonomous Data Warehouse being out for a year and the transactional process being out since August, how should we think about those two combining, to the reacceleration on top of ACI and you mentioned the thousand customers and 4,000 trials, what is actually the driver of people shifting over, is it speed? Is it cost? Is it performance? Just some more color on that would be great so timing and then why.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll let Larry start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. All right. So the driver is many different things. Some of our customers were stunned that they can get a database up and running in five minutes. We\u2019ve been collecting references and studying the thousand customers and the 4,000 trials and what they find encouraging about the Autonomous Database. Certainly, we\u2019ll call it productivity improvements. The fact they can go from not having a database, not having hardware, literally log onto our cloud. Up and runnings and doing useful things in five minutes is proving to be a shock to a lot of our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So getting things up and running quickly, productivity has been a very big issue. We\u2019ve got one customer who\u2019s done a series of tests. AWS user and I know we had these ads that promised cut your AWS bill in half. They found that we were running 11.5 times faster than they were running on AWS and they cut their bill by 80%. These are university researchers. So they\u2019re very, very cost sensitive and they felt it was worthwhile making the move, just because we were much less expensive, Autonomous Database was way less expensive than Redshift or Aurora at Amazon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some people they had an existing Data Warehouse and it was just the compatibility, being able to take an existing Data Warehouse, not spooling up a new one in five minutes but taking an existing Data Warehouse, lifting it and shifting each other. We\u2019re seeing all of those use cases. Productivity, motivators, I should say. Productivity, compatibility and cost. All driving the usage of Autonomous Database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve never had a release in the database area where we could actually talk to a CEO about what was in the release and the CEO would go I completely get it. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about partitioning or something like that. When you talk about the fact that this database patches itself our customers at the CEO level now understand what a patch is. They understand why it\u2019s so important, why it\u2019s so strategic. They in many cases have to discuss it with their audit committees. The fact that now patching goes from a problem to where they pass that to us and it gets done instantaneously, we have many customers who said if this thing did nothing but that, I would migrate to Autonomous Database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If the fact that \u2013 to Larry\u2019s point, this data base tunes itself, creates all its own indexes, that actually is labor \u2013 it\u2019s labor less and can you apply talent too. If it did nothing but give you better security and price and performance, so this is a release that the reason you\u2019re seeing the trials and the level why you hear enthusiasm the way it is the customer response is just extremely high because it just makes business sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This isn\u2019t something sold five levels down or four levels down in the org. This can be sold at the top of the company, if you will, at the CEO level. So it\u2019s why it\u2019s such an exciting release to us because the point it has so many business benefits to our customers as opposed to maybe the fact that you would think of traditionally many of our benefits being if you will technical. Its different explaining to a CEO what multitenant is and what in-memory is than frankly the benefits I\u2019ve just described.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Knowing how much we spend on patching I\u2019ve got a lead for your CRM system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I won\u2019t get too specific into your situation. You\u2019re a good use case with a very large bank with a tremendous amount of Oracle that frankly in many ways has done a fantastic job, but still has a window that has to be closed and this in terms of patch deployment and this is one vehicle to certainly a vehicle and the only vehicle I\u2019m aware of to get that done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Safra, can you give me quote for that reference. That would be great. Thanks, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the apps ecosystem. Mark, can you talk towards NetSuite because that\u2019s accelerated again this quarter and I was just wondering, look, when we talked about a few quarters ago it was like we tried to bring it over 20, but now we\u2019re in the high-20s. Was there anything special going on or is that kind of \u2013 is there anything in terms of new run rate that we need to be aware of? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I mean, as I\u2019ve said on multiple calls in a row, they\u2019ve been doing very well. I mean, this started tremendous acceleration we had last Q4 when their bookings growth was over 70% and you\u2019re just beginning to see that turn into now revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I believe the new rate is sustainable. And I actually think we can do better and our strategy\u2019s been very simple, and I know I\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s been frankly no more complicated than any salespeople internationally and domestically. We\u2019ve done both too, if you localize the product for more countries. We\u2019ve done many new countries that we\u2019ve now released in addition though that, we\u2019ve been building out more verticals, what we call suite success where we actually bundled in the implementation with what we sell and that\u2019s very, very popular with our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think the team has also done a marvelous job executionally. I know I say my comments pretty quick but as much as the ref flew grew in the quarter, our bookings actually grew faster than the revenue and so we\u2019re very excited about NetSuite. We have been excited about NetSuite. And I think that will continue to perform and I actually think we can do better than even what I just described today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Michael Turits with Raymond James.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Good evening. So you\u2019ve been seeing accelerating growth in cloud ERP and HCM and other areas of cloud. Is that growing accelerating enough and becoming a big enough piece of the business that we can now start to see an acceleration in the Cloud business overall which had some other headwinds?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, I guess he\u2019ll start. As I said in my comments, ERP and HCM are becoming a bigger and bigger part of our business. I mean, today our annual SaaS revenue and ERP and HCM\u2019s approaching $3 billion. It\u2019s growing sort of mid-20s. And I think it\u2019s going to get nothing but better and better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, I don\u2019t want to get too positive only in the context that we\u2019re beginning to see acceleration in some key parts. And so we are very focused on our competitors by brand and by industry. We deploy our sales force against those brands and against those industries as well as into our own user base and the reason I read the references the way I read them was so you\u2019d get a flavor that both our own user base is beginning to move in bigger numbers as well as the fact that we get competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remember, most of that user base is not sitting with us or traditional on-premise competitors. So, yeah, I mean, clearly it\u2019s a point of what I made earlier and I\u2019ll stop after this to say that our growing businesses are becoming bigger and bigger and you start putting the growth rates I\u2019m describing on numbers like $3 billion and you can do your own math and so we\u2019re very confident and feel very good about our position in those businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mark. If I could a follow up, quick one for Safra. Safra, you managed to keep CapEx low even with the OCI investment. Any expect to change in that trajectory where we\u2019re spending more capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I expect it to be very similar this next quarter to this past quarter and for the year it\u2019s basically the same, a little bit less than last year, so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re looking at. Of course, if there\u2019s a huge opportunity we may push the gas a little more, but you have to understand that our SaaS operation is really humming and we\u2019re getting enormous economies of scale there. That\u2019s why the margins keep improving and so we\u2019re able to sort of do it all within the same investment envelope so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m going to do something you haven\u2019t done in a while. I\u2019m going to take a built of a liberty and ask two questions. The first is for salve RASM you talked a bit on the call about cash flow which is growing double digits was down roughly 1%. You gave some color on the call. Can you talk a little more about the underlying factors here, was timing or your definition of when you recognized cash flow having an impact? Are there other things that are impacting that cash? And then I have a follow up for Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, there are two things going on. If you look just at the quarter, it\u2019s nothing but cash collections, timing of cash collections, nothing more really than that to focus in on. If you look at year-to-date, which you may look at in one of the other schedules, it\u2019s that and some tax payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s really the two things going on. So nothing special going on, happens every once in a while. If you look back previous years, you will see that and it\u2019s a very Q3 thing, frankly. Because by then we\u2019re collecting up a lot of previous quarters\u2019 bookings. So \u2013 billings, excuse me. So that\u2019s really it. Nothing special.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then as a follow up for Mark. You\u2019ve given some color on the Autonomous Database. But can you specifically discuss the types of workloads that are driving adoption of autonomous and especially new clients for autonomous [new] clients for the Oracle Database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the question police ought to get you for announcing you\u2019re going to ask two questions as opposed to just doing it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry, Mark. I decided to be polite about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, that was very thoughtful. I don\u2019t know. Larry, you want to start in on that one?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I mean, there are \u2013 database does a lot of different things. The researchers that I mentioned earlier that moving from AWS for a big cost savings, they\u2019re doing a combination of machine learning and computer vision to look at tissue samples and detect anomalous cells. Cancer [based kit] are using computers to diagnose cancer and that\u2019s a combination of machine learning and the Autonomous Database and that\u2019s an all new application. So, there are several people that are coming in with all new applications in the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually, the one\u2019s moving from AWS. Then there are traditional on-premise customers who are simply taking one of their millions of Oracle Databases, there are millions of these things out there and just lifting one of those databases, either a transaction processing and the associated application, either transaction processing application or Data Warehousing application, just lifting it intact, moving the data over and moving the application over to compute, moving the data over to Autonomous Database and running the same exact thing in the cloud. They\u2019re experiencing sometimes shocking performance improvements also. We had one customer that moved from On-Premise into the cloud and the cloud system ran many times faster than their on-premise system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then there are customers that are moving, existing big Oracle customers that are moving new development, the new application that\u2019s they\u2019re developing from developing them on-premise, they move test and development into the Cloud and they\u2019re the ones that, again, the general reaction there is there\u2019s much, much more productive getting running, it\u2019s much cheaper to do test and development, much more responsive, much more productive to move test and development from their on-premise infrastructure to the cloud infrastructure. So online transaction processing, lifting and shifting applications, data warehousing, lifting and shifting, test and development, moving from AWS, there are lots of different use cases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple quick follow-ons. Doing this off the top of my head Mark, I\u2019m roughly right. 20% of our customers on autonomous Data Warehouse, Autonomous Database right now are net new to Oracle. We did not have them before. And 80% are in our user base, roughly 70%, 75%, there\u2019s net no competition at all in the transaction. It\u2019s simply as Larry described a migration. 75% are actually into the LOB as opposed to IT, which I look at as very good news as well. So we\u2019ve got a lot of underpinning improving dynamics, my opinion, they\u2019re improving dynamics in terms of net new customers, in addition to movement of our database and certainly Analytical Data Warehousing is probably the biggest individual driver of anything we\u2019ve got.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thanks so much. My question\u2019s for Mark. Mark, as we think about the traction you\u2019re seeing in cloud ERP and where the demand\u2019s coming from, there\u2019s the massive On-Premise installed base opportunity but I think might not appreciate that more than half the market is the long tail of niche legacy vendors that most people haven\u2019t even heard of. Can you just give us a sense for your success in displacing that long tail, how much you think you\u2019re participating there versus the more usual suspects?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s exactly right, what you said. So I think it\u2019s common thought that the ERP market On-Premise is dominated by two vendors, Oracle and the company from Germany and those two vendors together have less than 50% of the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have more Fortune 500 customers for example. They have many big customers. But the blizzard of implementations, there\u2019s a blizzard of companies, it\u2019s that have the more than 50% market share, 54%, 55%, most of them are moved into private equity. They\u2019re not even public companies. They\u2019re on their second or third turn through private equity. They\u2019ve got no migration plan to the Cloud. Coy go on and on with all of these. That\u2019s why, as I mentioned earlier, we actually line up our development resources and our sales resources very focused on these competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They would have names like I mentioned a couple like McCormick and Dodge, if you\u2019ve heard of them. IBM believe it or not actually has got an old ERP system. There\u2019s a company called Deltek. There\u2019s a company called Lawson, a company called [ETHICA]. There\u2019s tens and tens of these, to your point and these are old, old pieces of code. These need to move.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They need to move to a more modern platform, and they are perhaps as attractive as any other market and in fairness, our user base actually knows our cloud roadmap. They actually have confidence in in our R&amp;D, they know we\u2019re going to be there to migrate them when they want to be there. They actually have less of a sense of urgency in many cases to move than the companies you\u2019re describing, Brad, because they\u2019re in much more desperate situations without a roadmap, without knowing how they\u2019re going to get from here to there, knowing their competitors are beginning to move.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have as much success today and if you ask one of our salespeople would you rather have one of these competitive territories where you\u2019re going after one of these niche vendors or would you rather have an E business suite territory, many of our salespeople say give me that competitive territory because there\u2019s an absolute need to move as quick as you can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, yeah, it\u2019s an incredibly attractive market andit\u2019s why you hear us keep talking about it so much because the additional fact is when we sell ERP, we continue to see an attach rate to HCM and frankly an attach rate to even some of our other apps in the CX and front office area as well so it\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on that opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will now turn the call over to Ken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours. Dial-in information can be found in the press release issued earlier today. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking with you. Thank you for joining us today, and with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for closing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for joining today\u2019s Oracle\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call.
