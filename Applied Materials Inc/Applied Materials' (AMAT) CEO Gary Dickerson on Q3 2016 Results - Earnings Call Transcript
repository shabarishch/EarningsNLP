Those of you joining us in New York will have the option to attend technology sessions with our general managers. The main event will be webcast live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gary Dickerson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Applied Materials delivered record earnings in Q3. And with our orders also at an all-time high, I\u2019m confident that we can beat this earnings record again in our fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to thank our employees for all their hard work that has contributed to these outstanding results and their passion to keep raising the bar. I\u2019ll start today by outlining the key factors supporting these record levels of performance and describe how our strategy positions Applied for sustainable long-term growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll also share our latest view on our markets in detail why Applied has a positive outlook for 2017 and beyond. I\u2019ll conclude with brief updates on each of our major businesses. After that, Bob will provide additional details about our results and outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In both semiconductor and display, we see dramatic advances in technology taking place. We are in the early stages of large multi-year industry inflections that are driving growth in our business today and creating new opportunities for the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, foundry and logic customers are making significant innovations in transistor and interconnect for 10 and 7-nanometer devices. This plays to the strengths of our leadership businesses, including Epi, PVD, Implant, CMP and RTP, where we lead the industry with our unique capabilities and high market share. As customers move to 10-nanometer technology, the available market for these leadership businesses grows by around 25% compared to the previous node.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second key inflection is 3D NAND. This is a materials-enabled technology that significantly expands our addressable market with innovative new products we are providing customers with the advanced solutions they need for depositing, removing, and modifying materials with incredible precision. As a result, we are winning significant share gains as the industry shifts from planar to 3D technology. By the end of this year, we will have grown our share of total NAND spending by almost 7 points above our 2012 baseline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The third big wave of investment is China, which represents an important long-term growth opportunity for the industry. Applied has been working in China for 32 years, and during this time, we\u2019ve established the strongest position in the region. While the build out of China\u2019s semiconductor industry has only just begun, our semiconductor orders in revenue have already doubled over the past two years, and we\u2019re on track for a record 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The fourth big driver for Applied is organic LED displays. OLED is also enabled by materials innovation and that makes our available market opportunity more than three times larger than for traditional LCD. OLED is the key for high resolution low-powered screens with faster refresh rates. We expect it to become the standard for virtual reality capable phones and headsets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Applied, our strategy is to develop highly differentiated materials engineering products and services that make new technologies possible. As our customers technical challenges become more complex, it\u2019s the breadth and depth of our capabilities that sets us apart. By building on these strengths, we are outperforming our markets today and creating a foundation for sustainable growth over the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are making great progress with all of the key elements of our strategy. First, we have strengthened our organization and processes in the field. In the past three years, we have increased the number of technologists and engineers directly supporting customers by 50%. This allows us to see inflections earlier and define winning products in a more repeatable way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, we have increased R&amp;D to accelerate new product development to provide the materials innovations that our customers need. We have a strong pipeline of differentiated enabling technologies that are winning in the marketplace and extending our innovation leadership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Third, we\u2019ve increased our focus on advanced service products. We are delivering more value to our customers, and as a result, our service business is growing to record levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fourth, we are successfully applying materials engineering beyond semiconductor. In display, we\u2019re on track to deliver more than $1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016 with significant opportunities for future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now provide our market outlook. In our discussions with customers, they describe near and longer-term drivers for their business that support sustainable growth and investments. These include increasing silicon content in smartphones to support advanced features, explosive growth of data for social media, 4K video, and IoT, that\u2019s fueling demand for memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And most exciting of all, emerging categories, such as virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and smart vehicles that create new platforms that demand high-performance computing, advanced memory, and better displays. Within this environment, we see customers battling for leadership and making strategic investments to ensure, they\u2019re in winning positions as demand shifts to these new device technologies. This is especially true in memory, where we see a broad base of customers accelerating their 3D NAND road maps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, NAND investment is getting stronger and we now anticipate that spending in 2016 will be 40% higher than last year. We\u2019re also seeing foundry investments strengthening and now expect spending for the year to be 5% to 10% higher than in 2015. While more than half of the spending is focused on leading edge 10 and 7-nanometer technologies. The foundry customer mix is broadening, as investments in trailing geometries increase, particularly in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In logic, we now believe 2016 spending will be marginally lower than 2015. And in DRAM, we still see spending coming down, at least, 25% from the very high levels of investment last year. Overall, we now expect 2016 wafer fab equipment investment to be slightly above 2015, and as we look further ahead, our early view is that 2017 could be higher. I will now talk about the progress we\u2019re making in each of our major businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In semiconductor, we see strong demand across the Board. Our quarterly orders and revenue are a 15-year high. And for fiscal 2016, we expect our revenue will be around $770 million higher than 2015. This gives me high confidence that this will be a strong shared gain year for us. What I\u2019m most excited about is our pipeline of innovative new products. Two great examples are the products we launched last month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Selectra system is the industry\u2019s first extreme selectivity etch tool. This disruptive etch technology enables precision materials removal that does not damage the increasingly delicate structures in advanced logic and memory devices. Selectra has great customer poll and we see significant growth in applications at future technology nodes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By the end of the year, we expect to have shipped more than 350 chambers to a broad set of customers. I\u2019m equally excited about our PROVision system, which is the industry\u2019s most advanced e-beam inspection tool. E-beam is the fastest-growing segment in the inspection market. The market doubled in size from 2011 to 2015 and is set for significant future growth. We see very strong demand for PROVision and have already shipped more than a dozen systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In service, our strategy is to deliver more value to customers with advanced service products that are focused on improving device performance, yield, and cost. Our team is doing a great job. In the third quarter, revenues were at an all-time high. When we look at year-on-year comparisons, we have grown our service business for 11 consecutive quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In display, our capabilities in large area materials engineering set us apart and we have tremendous momentum. The major display inflections are made possible by materials innovation and our available market is expanding significantly. We are in the initial phase of OLED investments and this opportunity is layered on top of solid demand for our leadership display products for TV and mobile. As a result, for the second quarter in a row, orders and display are at an all-time record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking further ahead, we\u2019re increasingly excited about DR and AR, as it has broad implications, not only for display, but also for semiconductor. Leading companies in Silicon Valley and around the world are making big investments in this area, and our technologists are engaged with them as they develop their roadmaps. We will spend more time covering this topic at our Analyst Meeting in September.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, I strongly believe this is Applied\u2019s time. We are performing better than ever delivering new records, and in a great position to sustainably outperform our markets. There are combination of factors that are contributing to our success. We identified large multi-year inflections early. We are making great progress with the major elements of our strategy, enabling us to unlock the full potential of Applied. We\u2019ve made significant investments in our capabilities and products to extend our innovation leadership and we are executing well across the organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me hand the call over to Bob, who\u2019ll provide more details about our quarterly results and performance. Bob?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Bob Halliday</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Gary. In Q3, Applied demonstrated that we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. We delivered the company\u2019s highest earnings per share surpassing our record set more than 15 years ago. Gary talked about the strategies that are helping us to anticipate major inflections, deliver more valuable products and services and grow in attractive new markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll describe some of the benefits that our strategies and execution are having on our financial performance. And I\u2019ll do this by comparing our most recent quarter to Q2 of 2011. I think this is an interesting comparison, because Q2 of 2011 was our best quarter since 2000, because revenue was nearly the same in both periods. Under our new strategy, we\u2019ve increased our semiconductor systems revenue by 23% to the highest level in 15 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve put our services business on a growth trajectory and increased our display net sales by over 50%. We have significantly reduced our investment in solar, which is down from 22% of revenue to only 2% today. And we\u2019ve increased our non-GAAP gross margin by 1.8 points. We\u2019ve also cut our tax rate and reduced our share count.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result of these and other improvements, we delivered a 32% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share this quarter versus Q2 of 2011. And we did this while investing 30% more in R&amp;D. In short, we demonstrated momentum in Q3 delivering higher earnings power at similar revenue even while investing significantly more in new products for future growth. And today, our momentum is accelerating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Q3, we generated record orders of $3.7 billion and we now have record backlog of $4.9 billion. We\u2019ve grown our semiconductor orders and backlog to the highest level in 15 years, and our display orders and backlog to the highest level ever. We\u2019ve grown our service orders by 9% year-over-year and our backlog by 18% year-over-year. We\u2019re also making excellent progress towards our 2018 financial model. We\u2019re approaching our targets for revenue across semiconductor, services, and display.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, we feel even more confident that we can hit or exceed our goal for WFE market share. We\u2019re making additional progress in gross margin coming in at the high-end of Q3 expectations. We\u2019re improving our efficiency even as we significantly increase R&amp;D funding for new products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fact, we\u2019ve reduced our OpEx to sales ratio to the lowest level in five years. We increased our non-GAAP operating margin by 3.6 points this quarter to 22.8%, which is the highest in five years. We\u2019ve made further progress with our tax structure. If our geographic sales patterns continue, we now believe that we can sustain a non-GAAP tax rate of 12.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We achieved our share count objective ahead of schedule. And we remained opportunistic with the buyback program, repurchasing 9 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $21.88. I hope you\u2019ll join us for the Analyst Meeting, where I\u2019ll give you more insights into our progress and momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, I\u2019ll explain our segment reporting changes. Effective in Q3, we expanded our Display segment to include roll-to-roll web coating systems, which were previously in ES. The segment is now called Display and Adjacent Markets. We\u2019ve also moved display equipment upgrades from AGS to display. These changes will enable us to realize technology market and management synergies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Applied\u2019s remaining solar business is now included in corporate and other and we no longer report ES as a segment. The Semiconductor Systems segment is unchanged and 200 millimeter equipment continues to be included in AGS. Our earnings release includes the information you\u2019ll need for your models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Here are some of our segment highlights for Q3. We grew semiconductor systems revenue to the highest level in 15 years. We increased the non-GAAP operating margin by more than 5 points sequentially to 31.1%, which is the highest level in four years. In Applied Global Services, we set a new revenue record of $657 million. In display, we recorded record orders of $803 million with more than half coming from projects in China. Compared to last quarter, we increased display revenue by 67% and display operating margin by 3.5 points to 20.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the balance sheet, we generated $981 million of cash from operations. Profitability and cash flow management were stronger in the quarter and our year-to-date operating cash flow was $1.7 billion, or 22% of sales. In the quarter, operating cash flow was 35% of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll provide our fourth quarter guidance. We expect our overall net sales to be up by 15% to 19%, sequentially. Within this revenue outlook, we expect semiconductor systems to be up by 19% to 23%, sequentially, AGS should be up by 3% to 6%, and display should be up by 30% to 40%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a year-over-year basis, each of our businesses is on track for strong quarterly revenue growth. Using the midpoints of our Q4 guidance, we forecast that semiconductor systems revenue will be up by 45% year-over-year, with AGS up 12%, display up 80%, and the total company up 39%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect Q4 non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flat sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses should be $600 million plus or minus $10 million and lower as a percentage of sales. And we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. This earnings guidance represents a new record for the company and a doubling of last year\u2019s Q4 performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, I believe our momentum is sustainable. Let me explain why? Our Q4 guidance reflects how uniquely well-positioned the company is a major inflections, including in 10-nanometer and 7-nanometer, 3D NAND, OLED and the Chinese market. While customer spending patterns will continue to vary from quarter-to-quarter, we are growing faster than our markets and accelerating our profitability. And we\u2019re just beginning to see the positive effects of a stronger product pipeline and better execution across the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on customer polls for our products and services, I believe we\u2019ll have strong orders in Q4 of 2016 and Q1 of 2017. And while it\u2019s too early to know our earnings in Q1 of 2017, I believe we can double our Q1 non-GAAP EPS year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me turn the call over to Mike for questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Bob. To help us reach as many of you as we can, please limit yourself to one question and feel free to reach you later if you have any additional questions. Let\u2019s please begin.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tim Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. So guys, obviously, great, great quarter, and obviously big opportunity in display. I guess, I want to ask a question on SSG. So if I take the orders you booked last quarter and I take this quarters orders, it\u2019s about $4.2 billion. And if I use your SSG share model of roughly 22%, that implies that the overall WFE market is sort of run rating in the first-half of roughly $40 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that begs the conclusion either this year is pretty front-half loaded or you guys are gaining a lot more share and that you\u2019re going to end the year quite a bit higher than 22%, and it has to be several hundred basis points higher than 22%. So, I guess, I\u2019m wondering if you can comment on whether the numbers imply that the year is a little front-half loaded, or whether it\u2019s just implies that you\u2019re gaining that much share? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Tim, let me see if I can help. In terms of the loading of the year, historically what you see is that the foundry is particularly good and kind of calendar Q \u2013 end of Q1, Q2 in terms of shipments, I\u2019m doing shipments and bookings is close for them. And then this year, though, it was later in the year as you remember, so we\u2019ve been strong in foundry as they\u2019re wrapping things like 10 and early 7. And then memory was stronger in the beginning of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if you look at Applied, specifically, we benefited earlier in the year, because we\u2019ve gained share in memory. We\u2019ve gained share in DRAM. We\u2019ve gained share in NAND, and that kept us strong. For instance, historically, the last couple of years, we were about 38%, 40% for full-year numbers for foundry, but we were only about 37% in Q2. We\u2019re up over 50% now in foundry in Q4 and Q1, okay. So what you\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019re betting from secular improvement in Applied, but also some seasonal strengthening in foundry. So both things are working for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we will gain share this year pretty significant, we don\u2019t want to say the specific number. In terms of WFE, the $40 billion run rate, I don\u2019t think WFE is that high, I think we\u2019re having some strength now. Last quarter, we said it was sort of $31.6 million plus, and this quarters it\u2019s probably up close to $32.6 million my guess.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But what you\u2019re seeing is secular gains for Applied across, particularly memory, strong positions in foundry, and also the China thing is helping us, a lot of things are working for us, that secular stuff is working for us, and also the seasonality in foundry is helping in the next couple of quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess, what I\u2019d add also is that in 10 and 7-nanometer foundry, we have \u2013 while our TAM is growing significantly, if you look at those two nodes together about 30%. And we have the initial adoption of many new platforms. We\u2019re actually winning more market share also in 10 and 7-nanometer, and we\u2019re still in the early innings of some of these new platforms that are being adopted, the Selectra product, the Olympia, PROVision, LK Prime, Precision CVD, very, very strong adoption of those new platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in memory, as Bob talked about, we\u2019re gaining share in memory. And especially in 3D NAND, 3D NAND is materials-enabled, not litho-enabled. So our TAM is expanding significantly, and there also we have many new innovative products, including the Sym3, which is the fastest ramping product in history of the company. So overall, this is going to be a great share gain year for Applied Materials and we\u2019re incredibly well-positioned going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Tim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Romit Shah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you and yes congratulations on the excellent results. Bob, you mentioned that you expected orders to remain strong in Q4 and Q1. Does that mean that, we shouldn\u2019t expect orders to decline from these levels. And I was hoping you could talk specifically around your expectations for display orders seeing them at $800 million here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. We \u2013 I think at the end of last call, when we had orders in Q2 of 3.451 billion that I said our orders would sustain and that we would continue to have strong orders. In fact, we beat this order with $3.658 billion, $36 billion, $37 billion. I think Q4 and Q1 are both pretty strong. I\u2019m not sure that quite as strong as we were the last two quarters. But they\u2019re bigger than probably any quarter we had last year, yes, it\u2019s going to be pretty big still. So, it\u2019s probably to have a 3 handle on it, frankly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Farhan Ahmad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. I just have a quick one. In terms of 2017 outlook, Gary, you mentioned that the WFE is expected to be up year-on-year. Can you just provide us some color in terms of the overall spending by the transition system in terms of flat memory versus foundry, and on NAND, if you see those \u2013 how you see they\u2019re expanding in those segment and also for display?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, this is Bob, I can kick it off and then Gary could jump in, too. In terms of this year, what you see is trends that are helping us a lot frankly. You see strong spending in NAND, whereas last year NAND was about, and I\u2019ll go into 2017 for you too. In 2015 rather, NAND was about 6.8, this year it\u2019s up 40% to 45%, about 9.7. And that is 90% for V-NAND. What we see next year is, NAND is going to be up a little more actually, and is going to be like 98% V-NAND, and our position is very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fact, some of the share gains we\u2019re seeing this year, you didn\u2019t quite see them last year, because last year was about 50% 2D, and our gains are really strong on the transition to 3D. So that will continue for us next year. So NAND up some next year, almost all being in our position very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of foundry, we think foundry could be p flat-to-up 5% next year. We think it\u2019s going to be very good for us in the leading edge, and we also think it\u2019s going to be good for us in the trailing edge in China and things like that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">DRAM, we think it could be up a little bit. This year it was down 25% to 30%, I think maybe 25% we said on the call. Next year, it maybe up a little bit, but it\u2019s the smallest of our numbers pretty much now except for logics or less, so it\u2019s about 5.9 this year, up a little bit next year. And then logic is probably up a little bit next year also. So overall, we see an opportunity to go up some next year. But it\u2019s a particular place for us around NAND and foundry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the second thing you asked about was display. Display CapEx you guys don\u2019t follow it closely. 2015 display CapEx and there\u2019s not as good as estimates, but we think it\u2019s little over $8 billion maybe. This year, it could be around $14.5 billion. We think next year continues at similar numbers, maybe a little bit more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Chin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Hi, Gary, Bob, also congrats on the results. My question is on the memory orders. So the memory orders declined pretty meaningfully in the July quarter. I was just wondering if you think that was just timing related, or do you think it\u2019s a function of the more rational spend by customers, and could we see a snapback in memory orders in the October quarter? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So the \u2013 I think that stuff is lumpy. We still see very strong demand for customers, particularly around V-NAND stuff. So we had a huge number in Q2 for V-NAND, because people frankly want to get in our production queue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Q3, we have reasonable NAND orders, but not as big as they were in Q2. So I\u2019d say, the demand is still strong. We\u2019re getting a lot of pull in NAND still, and I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the orders lumpiness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think the demand for 3D NAND is certainly extremely strong. Customers can sell everything that they can build. And if you look at where we\u2019re at in terms of that transition to 3D NAND, we\u2019re still not that far along in the overall transition. And so, every customer is moving as fast as they can from planer to 3D. And so, our thinking for 3D NAND going forward is still very strong certainly in 2017 still very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Stephen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. Bob, on the gross margins, I understand that great job from Q2 of 2011. But if I compare it to your 2018 financial model like flat gross margins versus 44.6% at 33.5% in WFE, a little bit below that mark. What will get us \u2013 what will get the gross margins higher from these levels? I understand the display mix helps the gross margins, but the foundry mix helps them?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I think, we\u2019re actually making progress. I thought earlier in the year, we would stay sort of flat to last year were up a little bit. Last year was 42.9, we were about 43.2. And this was a particularly strong year for display and also etch very well to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me just say display and etch are adding a lot to the operating profits of the company. Their model is a little bit different. For instance, display has a little lower gross margin, very comparable as they mature operating margin profile. And then etch has significantly grown their operating profit for the company over the last several years. And their operating margins have gone up a fair amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the specific question of 44.6, we said we\u2019d do 44.6 in 2018. If you took, I think, I said last quarter, if you took the mix we had and if you took the gross margins we had by individual product and compared it to 2014 mix, we\u2019re like 44.7. This quarter we did the same analysis, we\u2019re like 44.9.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re beating it if the mix didn\u2019t change, what we\u2019re facing is mix. We can offset a bunch of the mix. I don\u2019t know if we can offset all of it. So I think we\u2019ll make progress to the 44.6 next three years, there was a 44.6 was a 2018 number? Where we get there? I\u2019m not quite sure, because of X, but I feel very good about the top line, the gross profit dollars, the operating profit and the EPS of the company, the main issue is just the mix on the gross margin, because things like cost reduction are doing well, our negotiations are doing well. It\u2019s just the mix is the issue. And the operating margin don\u2019t \u2013 doesn\u2019t get impact as much as the gross margin with those businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Atif.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the gross margin question. With the second-half with more foundry logic investments coming up with 10-nanometer, I was under the assumption that should be extremely positive for your gross margin profile. So I\u2019m just curious if that is going to be more back-half loaded and into 2017, should we, at least, expect gross margins to improve into the fiscal Q1, given that it\u2019s flat in fiscal Q4? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They might depends on the mix. Remember in Q3 and Q4, we\u2019ve been growing a lot very strong in terms of revenues for both display and our etch business and memory, for instance. So if in Q1, we probably are going to be strong pretty much across the Board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So foundry, I think, has a potential to be strong. But I also think we\u2019ll be strong in display and probably in revenues in memory, because some of the revenues we ship into NAND in Japan are delayed about a after the shipment. So my guess is a little bit of upside opportunity in Q1, but I don\u2019t want to be too specific now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys, congratulations on the solid quarterly results and execution. Another focus by the market on display has been on OLED, but it seems like even in the core or large screen LCD segment, there\u2019s a lot of Board opportunity. There\u2019s still a lot of focus on 4K UHD. I think one of your peers recently in their call talked about three customers that have plans for gen 10.5 LCD plan investments in the not too distant future. So I\u2019m just wondering, if you\u2019re trying to see that in your pipeline? And is it something that you would expect orders for this year, or is this something more kind of 2017, 2018 timeframe?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019ll start and Gary can jump in. Actually, the core display orders for LCDs and related TVs have held up probably a little better than we thought and it looks like there might be an opportunity there. Now, what\u2019s the big inflection is the OLED stuff. But I do agree with you that the LCD and the TV stuffs held up a little better than we expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess, I could also add that display is a great opportunity for Applied Materials. We\u2019re still in the early innings and this smartphone transition to OLED. And the display is a key differentiator for mobile devices. So in the near-term, near-term being over the next couple of years, this is going to be a great driver for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If we think longer-term, we also see large technology companies making huge investments in new areas like VR, AR, and automotive, where display can be significant. We\u2019re also developing new innovative products that will significantly expand our served market over the next several years. So normalized spending in display could be higher than in the past and also our TAM is expanding on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And last thing on this one, I\u2019d like to say is that, really the display is an example of where we can take materials engineering into a new market and adjacent market and Applied is really unique in our ability to enable this big inflection and drive growth. So really overall great, great opportunity for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much and also congratulations. Gary, as you look at the 3D NAND market share gains you have made to-date, which process segments do you believe you\u2019ve made the most gains? And as the industry goes to say 64 layers and higher, where do you see incremental gains for the company on a going-forward basis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think the most important thing for people to think about on 3D NAND is that, this is an materials-enabled inflection, not litho-enabled. And it\u2019s a biggest change in memory technology in decades. So when you think materials-enabled, it really the products that we have targeted for 3D NAND, the Sym3 etch tool is the fastest ramp we\u2019ve ever had for any system in Applied Materials, and we\u2019re still in the early innings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the things that I believe is that, we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have so much pull from customers on Sym3. There\u2019s still an opportunity for growth there. Our CVD business is growing significantly. This year, we expect strong revenue growth in CVD gaining several points of overall share very, very strong position in 3D NAND. So that\u2019s another area where when you look at the 64 layers or you\u2019re going forward, there is a tremendous opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The number of CMP steps also double in maybe 2 even in some cases 3X number of CMP stuffs. So that\u2019s another area, where we have really, really a great position. And this is the first time also for us to introduce Epi into a memory device. So there are a number of different areas, where we have innovative platforms, innovative new products, and really tremendous pull from customers that give us a great opportunity as 3D NAND goes forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg with Pacific Crest.

Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just \u2013 I just wanted to touch on the logic spending being down this year, wondering why you think it\u2019s down if that\u2019s related to slowing node transitions, and just maybe gauge your conviction in it being up next year, like you commented. And if the softness is related to slowing node transitions, so I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on any risk that that spills over into the Foundry segment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We have \u2013 the numbers we have now, remember we have in logic, we have a major U.S. company and also some Japanese companies and things like that. So our numbers show, it\u2019s down 5% to 10% this year, and up 5% flat to 5% next year. Let me pull up the detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me take the second part of that while Bob is pulling up the information on the \u2013 on logic. Relative to foundry, what we see is that, all of our customers, all of our customers are targeting 7-nanometer as a big node, very big node. There\u2019s a lot of customers \u2013 their customers that are taping out. And so that is a big opportunity and every single one of our customers are in a race to be in the right position as that node ramps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the pull we\u2019re getting for customers on 10/7 is extremely strong. And as Bob said earlier, we see strong business in the trailing nodes also in foundry. And we see that, China being a big part of that, but we see that also continuing going forward in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, at least, from what we\u2019re seeing today, our customers in terms of advanced foundry and also relative to the trailing nodes in foundry, it looks like and what customers are saying is that, the business will be good for the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Thank you. Bob, I think your comments are making good progress towards the 2018 model where you stated, your Silicon Systems business is kind of approaching the size that you talked about for 2018 on the type of WFE number that sort of midpoint that you talk about. So is that \u2013 are you doing better earlier, because you\u2019re taking more market share at the TAM expanding faster, could you just talk about that? And if obviously, we\u2019ll wait till next month to get the full forecast, but any thoughts on will that continue to move higher from here on both share and TAM? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, on the semi stuff, two things have really compounded for us. So and in fairness to us, we kind of predicted, that\u2019s what we\u2019re positioned. But one, the market changes have really come out frankly as we expected in terms of the transition from 2D to 3D, and also the products they need and the transition on foundry has been going that way. And also China has helped somewhat, and we\u2019ve always been strong in China we kept our strength there. So those market inflections in semi and also we\u2019ll talk about display market inflections. We kind of had a pretty good feel for those coming, but we didn\u2019t have exactly the right products there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we strengthened our product positions in places like etch, CVD, ALD inspection, we\u2019re going to be talking about more, because we think you need more and more of that particularly e-beam, as you get through foundry and logic and places like that. So it\u2019s a compounding of the market turned out pretty close to what we expected, and we have the right products there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the reason you\u2019re seeing acceleration this year, frankly, is the market inflections are happening this year. For instance, this year you\u2019re seeing a big spend increase in NAND and it\u2019s 90% V-NAND, that\u2019s where the share opportunities are. And we\u2019re seeing a fair amount of spending in 10 and 7, were strong, interestingly OLED spending in display. And we\u2019ve introduced new products in each one of those markets to capitalize on it. So, we\u2019re probably ahead of plan, frankly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Edwin Mok with Needham &amp; Co. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Edwin Mok</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, I have a question about sustainability of or how sustainable this ramp of multiple areas. And I guess, it specifically relate to customer concentration. So it seems like leading edge foundry 10/7-nanometer foundry and also OLED are big drivers now or definitely a big driver for you this last quarter you said those are sustainable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I was wondering, are you seeing like broadening or increased number of customer, both from leading edge 10/7 in foundry, as well as got the increased number of display customers are all placing order for OLED, or just still concentrate at one or two customer of those \u2013 just that those customer aggressively ramping? That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll start and Gary can jump in again. So there are several inflections we\u2019ve noted. One is NAND, one is OLED, one is China, and the other one which is going on right now is foundry leading edge, in particular, so let me speak to those. NAND is \u2013 there\u2019s about $1.4 million wafer starts in the world, by the end of this year, it\u2019s going to be about 400,000 transition to V-NAND.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think the vast majority of those get transition for many reasons. We think the spending on NAND probably is up next year and our position is strong. And we think that that transition remains strong for a number of years and plays very well for us. We think in OLED, they\u2019re in pretty early innings on the transition to OLED on the phones. In fact, the orders we\u2019re showing that we\u2019ve been booking and we have some more to come, those things will ship through 2017 and to early 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re going to see reverence for that for a while and that\u2019s just what we\u2019ve been booking, okay. And we believe there\u2019s more down the road, okay. So this OLED transition is going to go on for a while and we have enriched the opportunity for us by developing new products there just as we have in semi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of China as an inflection, I mean, just listening to the Chinese government, they\u2019re in this for a long-term and their interest in investing in the semiconductor is probably only going to increase, okay, and our position is strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then finally, the foundry one you asked about, Edwin, which is particularly focused on. Right now, the leading edge is strong and it\u2019s strong into early next year, and that one does have some seasonality. But if you look at the longer-term trends there and just listen to the voice of our biggest customer, about 50% of their growth is going to be come from more features in phones, and about 50% is everything else that you see in Silicon Valley, whether it\u2019s a autonomous cars, virtual reality, machine learning, AI, all these things are driving about 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it isn\u2019t just one big thing, it\u2019s a whole slew of things. And I think we\u2019re going to do at Investor Day a very interesting discussion about virtual reality and not just what it drives in display, but what it drives in memory and what it drives in advanced processors. So in foundry on the leading edge, it isn\u2019t just phones. 50% of leading edge customers is content in phones going up, but 50% is all those other stuff which you can see, okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, in terms of the other things going on in foundry is the trailing edge is very strong and that\u2019s kind of a China phenomenon, but there\u2019s also the content in phone when you\u2019re talking about all the cameras and sensors and things like that. So I think, foundry is in pretty good shape next year. And I think it\u2019s got probably more sustainability overall than people said a few years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of other companies at the leading edge, I think others will need \u2013 want to compete, because it\u2019s a big market they want to be at the leading edge. And the timing and magnitude of the spending on that we haven\u2019t disclosed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Edwin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.

I think, you have two consecutive quarters in China over $800 million of orders. I understand that some of that comes from display. I think, Bob, you mentioned display was half of the orders this quarter from China?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if you back that out, do you feel that the $400 million to $500 million per quarter of order run rate is the base case now and start moving up from here, or do you think there\u2019s still some lumpiness in orders in China?.And have you seen much order activities from local foundries, or are they mostly still coming from the multinationals at this point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Well, again, we have a strong semi business in China and a strong display business. So I do display first. We see the trends where the Chinese are heavily invested in display business and want to share there, probably continuing for a number of years. They are not heavily into OLED yet, but their interest in display is very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of semi, the government has obviously said, their interest is very strong and sustainable. So that I think that you may have lumpiness, but I think you\u2019ve raised the baseline, particularly in semi and the display baseline has already been going up for a while now. So I think that you\u2019re going to see pretty sustainably strong orders in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, let me add on this one. We\u2019re in a very strong position with both multinational and domestic companies. Relative to share, China is one of the strongest regions for Applied Materials. Relative to the investment, you hear the word strategic when you think about China, there\u2019s a focus on growing the percentage of domestic content and building a secure supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as Bob said, there has been announcements around huge investments over the next decade in China. So again, we\u2019re in a very strong position. We think this is a multi-year wave. Certainly, we see strong growth in 2016, but we think it\u2019s a great growth opportunity also going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Craig Ellis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, congratulations on the results and outlook and thanks for sneaking me in. I wanted to switch from a more model intensive question maybe two or more qualitative question. Bob it was helpful to get a lot of the longer-term context on the financial performance of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the question as we look at the ability of the company to redirect to some new opportunities like OLED is. Relative to the longer-term history of the company, where do you think the product development engine is? And how much further upside do you have, as we look ahead for SAM expansive type of products that would be on the roadmap? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a really good question. Let me just spend a couple of minutes, if you don\u2019t mind. If you go look at it, our guide for Q3 was frankly significantly north of the street. I think we guided to $0.48 and the streets three months ago was at $0.36. Now, we\u2019re guiding to about $0.65, roughly, and the street was $0.48. And now we\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to \u2013 we have 3.5, almost $3.5 billion of orders last quarter, almost $3.7 billion this quarter. Next two quarters, we\u2019re hoping to have around three each.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So there\u2019s something\u2019s changed here. So the question you\u2019re really asking is, what\u2019s changed disruptively either in the market or at Applied Materials? I think there\u2019s really three answers. One, I think the market has changed and it really has in terms of what type of equipment people need to make leading edge devices and leading edge displays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For instance, in 2012, 53.5% of the CapEx WFE spending by semi customers was in places, where we competed. Now, this year we think it\u2019s 63.5%. And in those markets, where we compete in semi, we\u2019re gaining share where we had weaker share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in the market changes to make leading edge devices they need to buy different sets of leading edge equipment. And frankly, they need from very strong big capable suppliers, because the problems are just getting harder. They\u2019re putting things in the production earlier than ever before and ramping faster. In display, you say the same thing, make an OLED display is harder to make an LCD display.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So having the right products, we\u2019re introducing new products. So in the marketplace, there has been big inflections V-NAND devices totally different architecture. So big inflections number one in the market. But number two, the products are very well-positioned now for us. So I can see it is going on for a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, the third thing is, well, how you\u2019re doing at Applied? I honestly believe that we will all grow by several points the markets in which we\u2019re competing. You might be saying, well, how can you possibly know that for several reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One, we defined the financial model here right. The spending we put into products is significantly more than we used to relative to our total spending. So we invest more than we used to in product versus just maintain the lights in the building and operating the place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the investment relatively speaking is heavier in product development and the batting average on new products is going up. We\u2019ve put 50% more technical guys in the field, I think, who\u2019ve invested in R&amp;D and the products we\u2019re coming out with are not not just iterative products, they\u2019re disruptive innovative products. And if you go and get leading edge, logic and foundry customers,the number of DQR positions we have. The number of new platforms we have. We\u2019ve changed the model, the investment model, and the batting average on the new products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the other reason, I\u2019m pretty confident, I can see the products coming down the pipe. So I think that Applied is going to outgrow the markets that we compete in for the next several years, 5, 10 years, now I can\u2019t see. For the next number of years, I feel good about where we\u2019re investing, how we\u2019re executing in the market opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I guess, let me add to this one. The fundamental driver for our businesses today from a market standpoint is materials innovation. So if you look at 3D NAND, its materials-enabled scaling. If you look at how people are trying to solve etch placement errors in litho, there\u2019s a lot of materials innovation that can dramatically reduce etch placement errors, and that\u2019s a big deal for our customers going forward in multi-patterning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so that\u2019s the core competency of Applied Materials. We\u2019re broader, deeper, have more competencies, more technology, more talent than anyone in the world. And relative to semi, you see today, we\u2019re in the early adoption of some great innovative products, not incremental products, innovative products. And the pipeline we have there is also tremendous. We have great products in the pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at display, Applied is unique and our ability to take these technologies into large areas and into new markets. And we\u2019ve also innovated with new TAM growth. Thin film encapsulation is an example, where we have hundreds of millions of dollars in business enabling the transition to organic LED and mobile. And we have other capabilities they\u2019re also in the pipeline that are as significant relative to growth drivers for us longer-term outside the semiconductor industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is personally what I love about Applied. This is what where I love to spend my time. The company has so much talent, so much capability. I really believe that we\u2019re still in the early innings relative to innovation in semi, in materials-enabled scaling, with disruptive new platforms, and also outside the semiconductor business into adjacent markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Craig.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Daryanani</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter, guys. I guess my question is on the gross margin trajectory as you guys see from here for the next few quarters. It seems like a lot of the growth drivers you\u2019ve talked about on display or in CVD and etch. It seems like they might be somewhat headwinds to your gross margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So can you just maybe talk about what are the offsets of the leverage you might have to negate the mix headwinds and enable the margin expansion as you go forward from here over the next few quarters?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, there\u2019s several things. One is the cost reduction, which is the best we\u2019ve done in years. The second one is, we just hammer away at every single product to get better and offset the mix that might be a little harder. And then the third one is continuing it through disruptive products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For instance, we think we\u2019re going to grow our inspection business in terms of market share this year and probably next year, and we have new products coming out, and those products tend to be strong gross margins. So we do have \u2013 we have mix that\u2019s pushing back us a little bit, but we have other things that could cover that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for squeezing me in. I have a very short question for Gary. You talked about display CapEx kind of flattish next year. In that context, I see the growth for AMAT coming from share gain, especially in capsulation. When do you think we\u2019re going to learn more about this? Is it something that you\u2019re going to discuss at Analyst Day, or are we going to learn more as those share gains are materialized?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the question, Mehdi. Yes, we will definitely talk more about display at the Analyst Meeting. And really also focus on some of these longer-term opportunities, where some very large technology companies are making huge investments and where we have great opportunities in display going forward. So we definitely will cover that in more detail at the Analyst Day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mehdi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Jagadish Iyer from Summit Redstone. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jagadish Iyer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks for taking my question. So if I look at your display revenues growing about well over 50% year-over-year in calendar 2016 versus calendar 2015, what percentage has come from OLED? And how should we think about it as we look at calendar 2017?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. The revenue growth has been obviously very strong, and the bookings we have, we believe we have momentum into 2017 on the revenue line. If you look at the bookings the share in display, they\u2019ve been probably about two-thirds or more around OLED and about one-third roughly around LCD stuff.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So then if you look at the revenue split, it\u2019s probably about 30%, 40% LCD and about 60% OLED this year. So last year was probably closer to two-thirds LCD, I think, and one-third are not too big OLED. And here it is, yes, it\u2019s probably at 70% last year was LCD, so it\u2019s flipped. So it was 70%, 30% one way last year and this year it\u2019s probably 60%, 40% roughly 65%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Jerome Ramel with Exane BNP. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jerome Ramel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you for taking my question. What kind of capacity are you modeling for 10-nanometer node and 7-nanometer node in foundry going forward? Total installed capacity with start amounts?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so capital intensity 10-nanometer is up over 25% from 16/14. And at 7, we think it\u2019s up again, but we haven\u2019t set a specific number yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Bob was referring to our TAM opportunity, and I think the combination 10, 7 something like 30% somewhere in that range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think it\u2019s actually more than 30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya, thank you for taking the call, and congrats on a great quarter. You guys, given that you guys seem to be firing on all cylinders. What are maybe a couple idiosyncratic risks that we should be monitoring?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s a good question. Let\u2019s think. Where we\u2019ve\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think for us we have tremendous opportunities. The key for us, I really do believe, we can grow as fast as we can qualify. We have great platforms, where we\u2019re totally targeted on major inflections very, very innovative products, where we have tremendous customer pull. So I think the tension for us really is to make sure that we can qualify with customers, work with customers, because there\u2019s just incredible pull for us in a number of different areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I would say that, we for sure are going to grow share. The rate of that growth is really up to us relative from an execution perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, maybe I\u2019ll pile on a little bit. You always have, it\u2019s not idiosyncratic the macro risk, which I think is moderate, but that\u2019s a risk. I think the other one to add what Gary said, there has really been a change in my opinion at Applied that we didn\u2019t have as much growth stuff being considered a few years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have really built a funnel of great ideas with customers, customers are pulling for us big time now. So our issue is how do we optimize all the opportunities. So it\u2019s like how good can we be and that\u2019s a tension we have every single day, which projects do we follow up, which ones we push faster, which ones so becomes how many different things we realize how fast. So it\u2019s optimizing the portfolio really.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Charles. And Shawn, we\u2019ve got time for maybe two more questions, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Tim Arcuri with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tim Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot. Gary, I\u2019m just looking at these numbers and I\u2019m sitting here listening to you talk about all the market share gains. And I guess I just wanted to give you a chance to sort of talk about how this has happened, because was some of this in the pipeline before the Tokyo Electron merger, or did the merger fall apart and you just completely decided to totally reposition the company. And I guess just give us a sense of sort of the genesis of this success to maybe help people deconstruct how this might look going forward? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks for the question. So we focus on big inflections where and I think Bob talked about this earlier. We could see the big inflections a few years in advance and we made a decision that we would shift hundreds of millions of dollars in spending in the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we cut G&amp;A a significant amount. We significantly dramatically reduced our spending in solar. And all of those \u2013 all of that money we shifted keeping OpEx relatively flat into areas, where we have great opportunities Applied has great talent and great competencies and great technologies, but we needed to make the investments and fuel the growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that happened, frankly, maybe three or four years ago, where we started that shifting of resources and really focused in the areas where we knew that we had great opportunities. We also have added talent into the company to help us execute on those opportunities. And that\u2019s really the playbook and I would \u2013 we\u2019re still driving that playbook today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I look at the semiconductor business in the pipeline. We have some phenomenally valuable and disruptive products still in the pipeline, where we have great opportunities going forward. And also outside semi, we have some great opportunities that are sizable opportunities, where we can still drive growth for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So those are the things we did. It wasn\u2019t something that frankly with the Tokyo Electron merger, we kept our eye on the ball, we were laser focused on these opportunities. All through that process and we were ready basically when these inflections were ramping with the right products and the right team to execute. Bob, if you want to add anything.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s true. I think you have two-part question there, Tim. One is, how come the stuff so apparent now? And two, did Tokyo Electron have any impact or at the end of the merger have an impact? I think the answer to the first question is, if you\u2019re going to gain share in an equipment business like ours with the semi display, the opportunity is on inflections, big changes in how they make chips or they make displays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019ve got to have the right product that inflection or change an older or new OLED device. So you can look at stuff, we even did in the public domain. There were a number of people who said that, we should be less aggressive investing in display and solar. We decided there were two very different business models and so we increased our investment display, because we saw the inflection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But you\u2019ve got to wait two or three years for the inflection or the product won\u2019t be ready. You can\u2019t shoot behind the duck, right? The ducks got to be two years ahead of you, three years ahead of you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then second what we saw coming was NAND. And in fact, maybe even at your conference in 2014, I thought being NAND at the end of the County was going to be a little bigger than it ended up being, because we saw the inflections. We were betting on it even if you go back to your conference event 2014 early 2014. And we had the product that\u2019s doing pretty well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So now what you have is, these inflections, products will take two or three years to come along. The hard part frankly was bridging this period. And now what\u2019s going to happen is the products, where the pipeline inflections are happening and we have more products in the pipeline for more inflections, if you go look at areas like inspection and things like that. So the momentum is building up. We had to get through a two or three-year period. In terms of Tokyo Electron, Gary forced everybody to stay focused on the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Tim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your final question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks for taking a follow-up. I have a question for Gary. Gary, given your background in process diagnostics and control, what is Applied strategy moving forward in terms of integrating the e-beam success you\u2019re having as well as other products with etch and the process reactors we\u2019ve seen Hermes and ASML getting together Kelly LaMar [ph] still trying to get together, just wanted to get your thoughts on how much closer control and integrated metrology can you benefit from in your process and etch reactors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Halliday</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, let me talk a little bit about the inspection business. So this is going to be a very strong year for us. In that business, we could have a record year \u2013 our fiscal year 2016 revenue in this business and very, very strong pull from customers. As you said I have a lot of history relative to this business. And what I would say is that, e-beam what I hear from customers is that, e-beam is really at an inflection point. If you look at the changes in the devices, the device structures, there\u2019s a bigger problem with systematic types of problems, where e-beam is the best solution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we see tremendous pull from customers really an inflection relative to e-beam technology, especially focused on these systematic defects. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing from a market perspective Applied Materials over half of our revenue is e-beam. We have the strongest technology in the market in e-beam. We are the leader in e-beam review. We\u2019re gaining share in CD SAM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve just launched this PROVision product, and I think there\u2019s just tremendous opportunity with PROVision in the first year of launching the product. We\u2019re already getting reorders from leading foundry and memory customers. And I believe what we talked about before was achieving 20% share in e-beam inspection in the first year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we see tremendous growth opportunities in e-beam, in an area where Applied is the strongest relative to technology. So overall, in PDC, we have a great \u2013 we have great technology, very strong customer pull, and a great opportunity to drive growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thank you, Atif for your question, and we\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us this afternoon.
