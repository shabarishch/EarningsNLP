Please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Dan Glaser</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Glena. Good morning, and thank you for joining<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses. John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> morning is, Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first quarter represents a great start to the year. Before I get into the results, I would like to say how delighted we are to have completed the JLT acquisition earlier this month. There is tremendous energy and optimism around the benefits this combination brings to clients, colleagues and shareholders. We welcomed over 10,000 talented colleagues into the organization, providing us with more capabilities to serve clients. And this is the real power in this combination.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The need for specialist advice has never been greater as clients deal with the increasing size, complexity and range of business challenges. Simply put, we are stronger together. We are the leading global professional services firm in the areas of risk, strategy and people. On a combined basis, we place over $100 billion of P&amp;C insurance and reinsurance premiums globally. Our reach extends to more than 130 countries. We are number one in insurance brokerage, including specialty lines, the number one health and benefits broker.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are neck and neck in reinsurance. We are number one HR consulting firm. And we have leading specialist industry capabilities in management consulting. Size and scale are increasingly important but size isn\u2019t everything. Quality and capability are what really matter to clients and on that score, we are second to none. Creating what is Marsh &amp; McLennan today was no small undertaking. It took decades of steady execution and courageous decisions. I am deeply grateful to the prior leaders of Marsh &amp; McLennan for their significant contributions to our current success. We will continue to build and improve the reach and capabilities of MMC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to JLT, we worked tirelessly to obtain all regulatory and shareholder approvals so that we could close the deal on April 1. At the beginning of March, we announced the agreement to divest JLT\u2019s aerospace business. And during the first quarter, we secured $6.5 billion in debt financing at favorable rates, including our first ever euro bond issuance. With the benefit of the in-house expertise of Oliver Wyman, we moved quickly to establish transition teams to plan the integration. We made several leadership announcements across the organization and named JLT executives to nearly all of our executive committees. We selected leaders without regards which organization they came from.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">JLT brings us an influx of talent with complementary capabilities giving us more depth in almost every part of the organization. We are co-locating our colleagues to enhance opportunities for collaboration. We are working hard to keep our organization focused and are encouraged by the strong finish to 2018 at both JLT and Marsh &amp; McLennan and our strong start to 2019. Growth requires hard work and execution. And I have every confidence we will be stronger and better position than either firm was before. To be clear, we are not promising perfection. There will be bumps and we could see an impact on growth during the integration process. That\u2019s fine. We will sort it out and press forward as we work to build something special.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to JLT, we will continue to execute our broader growth strategies. We will not let up on innovating, pressing it to new growth areas and investing. For example, we continue to expand in middle market commercial insurance through Marsh &amp; McLennan Agency. When we first announced the JLT acquisition, we committed to continue to provide MMA financial possibility to pursue further acquisitions. We have stayed true to this plan. Since the start of the year, MMA acquired Bouchard Insurance and Lovitt &amp; Touche, both top 100 U.S. insurance brokers. The combination of strong organic growth and having high-quality agencies through acquisitions has resulted in MMA\u2019s annualized revenues exceeding $1.5 billion, and we still see significant runway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is meaningful growth potential in the small commercial segment across our businesses, where we are focused on digital initiatives. We see opportunities to help simplify the client experience and add value at every turn in this large and fragmented market. Major challenges facing society also present opportunities to grow and help our clients. In many markets, actual losses from cyber, flood and other natural perils far exceed insurance coverage. Filling this gap is a growth opportunity for us that also serves a greater good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Retirement security is a major challenge for society as much of the world is falling short of what today\u2019s aging population will need. Mercer is a leader in this space where actuarial investment in FinTech specialties meet. In Health, the need for advice in the face of healthcare complexities is significant and we are well positioned given the strength of our capabilities across Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me spend a moment on current P&amp;C insurance pricing trend. Overall pricing is modestly higher. The Marsh global insurance market index, so an increase of 3% in the first quarter, up from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 1% in the first quarter of 2018. Global property lines continue to see price increases. Casualty price declines have slowed while professional lines pricing increased approximately 6% in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to reinsurance. Guy Carpenter\u2019s Global Property Catastrophe Rate on Line index increased 1% for the January 1, 2019, renewals. More recently, the pricing data coming out of the April 1 renewals, which are primarily focused on Japan, were up for loss impacted programs. We are starting to see upward rate pressure in the market in certain pockets and geographies although capital remains abundant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. Marsh &amp; McLennan had a strong start to the year. We generated consolidated underlying revenue growth across both Risk &amp; Insurance Services and Consulting. Consolidated revenue was $4.1 billion, up 2% or 4% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 11% to $1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 10% to $1.52.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Risk &amp; Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, an increase of 3%. Underlying revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of underlying growth of 5% or more in RIS. Marsh had another strong quarter with underlying growth of 5%. Guy Carpenter\u2019s underlying growth was impressive at 6%, given the tough comparable of 7% growth in first quarter 2018. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $775 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points versus a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Consulting, first quarter revenue was $1.7 billion, in line with the year-ago. Underlying revenue was up 2% for the quarter driven by strong underlying growth at Oliver Wyman of 7%, partially offset by Mercer which was flat. Nevertheless, we had strong growth in Consulting adjusted operating income of 18%, and saw a 270 basis points of adjusted margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Martine took over as CEO of Mercer March 1. While Mercer is underlying growth was soft in the quarter, Martine has a firm grasp on the business, and we are confident in Mercer\u2019s long-term growth outlook. Based on the slow start, full your underlying revenue growth in Mercer could be muted. However, full year earnings growth will benefit from Mercer\u2019s recent restructuring initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year. For 2019, we expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion and solid growth in adjusted EPS, although with respect to underlying revenue, we are mindful of potential impact from the integration of JLT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark McGivney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Dan. Good morning. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year. Overall revenue was up 2%, 4% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter increased 3%, while adjusted operating income was up 11% to a record $1 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 210 basis points to 26.2% and included strong margin expansion in both RIS and Consulting. GAAP EPS rose 4% to $1.40 and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.52.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at Risk &amp; Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.4 billion, up 3% compared with the year ago and 5% on an underlying basis. This is a continuation of the strong growth we generated in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $775 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 33.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Marsh revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and helped by strong new business. The U.S. and Canada division continued its trend of strong growth with 5% underlying revenue growth. In International, underlying growth was also 5%, with EMEA up 3%, Asia Pacific up 8% and Latin America up 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $663 million, up 6% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in the U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America. Guy Carpenter\u2019s strong first quarter performance builds on the outstanding results delivered in 2018. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.7 billion, which is flat versus a year ago and up 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting strong growth at Oliver Wyman offset by softness at Mercer. Adjusted operating income grew 18% to $291 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mercer\u2019s revenue in the quarter was $1.2 billion, with flat underlying revenue growth due in part to a tough year-over-year comparison to the 5% underlying growth we reported in the first quarter of last year. Results this quarter reflected growth in health and career offset by a decline in wealth. Wealth underlying revenue fell 3% in the quarter, reflecting a mid-single digit decline in defined benefits, partially offset by continued growth in investment management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our assets under delegated management continue to grow and were approximately $265 billion at the end of the quarter. In early 2017, we established the wealth business by bringing together our retirement and investments businesses. This changed the line more closely with how we serve clients and was designed to simplify the organization and reduce layers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this point, given the evolution of these businesses, we will now report wealth is one combined business. Health underlying revenue increased 3% in the quarter despite a tough comparison of 7% growth in the first quarter of last year and Career grew 2%. Mercer incurred $11 million of charges in the quarter related to its ongoing restructuring program, which we expect to be completed by the end of the second quarter. The benefits of the program contributed to the strong earnings growth and margin expansion in Consulting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Dan mentioned, we expect this program will benefit full year earnings in Consulting, although we will see moderation in margin expansion from the level in the first quarter as we move through the balance of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oliver Wyman had a great start to the year, with first quarter revenue of $518 million representing growth of 7% on an underlying basis. Results were strong across most of the portfolio. As you know, we closed our acquisition of JLT on April 1. Due to strict rules regarding sharing of competitively sensitive information prior to closing, we are in the process of reviewing the details of JLT\u2019s 2019 budget, converting their results to U.S. GAAP by quarter and developing a firmer perspective on some of our modeling assumptions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, we expect to update the elements of our previous guidance on our next call. We continue to expect the JLT acquisition to be modestly dilutive to adjusted GAAP EPS in year one, breakeven in year two, and accretive in year three. In order to help the investment community better assess the combined business, before our next earnings call, we plan to provide JLT\u2019s 2018 results by quarter under U.S. GAAP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we will file the SEC required pro forma disclosures showing 2018 pro forma earnings for the combined company. As contemplated in our financing plans, we raised a total of $6.5 billion of senior notes across eight tranches of debt at various maturities. In addition to $5.25 billion of U.S. debt, we also completed our first euro bond offering in March, raising an additional \u20ac1.1 billion. We began incurring interest expense and generating interest income on proceeds from this debt as of January 15. In our GAAP income statement includes $47 million of interest expense and $25 million of interest income as a result.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we indicated on our last call, both of these items were excluded from adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Following the close of the transaction, we now expect second quarter interest expense will be about $114 million (17:11). We also incurred $7 million of interest expense in the quarter, representing the amortization of fees related to our bridge facility. This $7 million is included in interest expense and our GAAP income statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, we recorded a net gain of $29 million relating to the hedge instruments we put in place as part of the transaction. All of these costs associated with the JLT acquisition have been treated as noteworthy item. With the transaction now completed, our hedge position and our bridge facility have been settled and closed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to investment income, on a GAAP basis, investment income was $5 million or $1 million on an adjusted basis in the quarter. For 2019, we continue to expect only modest investment income on an adjusted basis. Foreign exchange was $0.03 per share headwind to EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in each of the second and third quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 22.6% compared to 23.5% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete item, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. We expect that most of the tax benefit from equity awards will be recognized in the first quarter of each year, which is when most of our equity awards bet. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 26%. Based on the current environment, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2019, excluding discrete items in any impact from JLT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, we implemented the new lease accounting standard. This result in a minimal impact operating income, but did result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet of $1.9 billion, which is largely offset by a corresponding increase in assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, we did not repurchase any stock in line with our guidance that we would not repurchase stock ahead of the close of the JLT acquisition. However, we continue to anticipate repurchasing enough stock in 2019 to satisfy our commitment to reduce our share count each year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $13 billion or $12.3 billion, excluding commercial paper. This compares with $5.8 billion at the end of 2018. Total debt includes the $6.5 billion of debt issued in the first quarter to fund the acquisition of JLT. At closing, JLT had $1 billion of debt outstanding, $450 million of which was repaid shortly after closing, leaving $550 million of JLT debt that is still outstanding. We will likely refinance this debt over the course of the next several months. Post closing, our total debt, excluding commercial paper stood at $12.8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next debt maturity is in September 2019 with 300 million of senior notes will mature. At this point, our expectation is that we will retire the September notes with cash on hand in line with our plan deleveraging over the next couple of years. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was 1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Note that the cash proceeds from our debt issuance in the quarter were held in escrow as reflected on our balance sheet as opposed to on the cash line. Uses of cash in the first quarter included $210 million for dividend and $288 million for acquisition. While deleveraging will be a priority over the next couple of years, we provided for the flexibility to continue to pursue selective acquisition and MMA will be the primary focus given the significant success of this strategy over the last decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year 2019, we continue to expect to deliver on our annual capital return commitments to reduce our share count and increase our dividends per share by double digits. As noted on our last call, starting this quarter, we have changed our calculation of adjusted operating margins to exclude transaction amortization, so investors can get a better sense of core margin performance following the JLT acquisitions. This change had no meaningful impact on the increase in margin in Q1 compared with a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our press release includes supplemental information that recast our margins in 2017 and 2018 by quarter to exclude transaction amortization. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our strong start to the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Glaser</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mark. Glena, we\u2019re ready to begin Q&amp;A.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. My first question, Dan, a couple of times in your remarks you alluded to the fact that there could be an impact on growth during the integration of JLT. I mean, I know you guys are only a month into the deal. But could you just expand some comments on that? What part of your businesses you expect \u2013 you could see some headwinds? And then kind of as a supplement to that question, are you guys going to include JLT within the acquired revenue line or is it going to be part of organic revenue starting in the second quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Elyse. And okay, so MMC\u2019s underlying growth has been in a range of 3% to 5% for the past decade. And I certainly anticipate that sort of range or better over time. So I\u2019m not \u2013 any comment I\u2019d make is really in the near-term as opposed to thinking about mid-term or long-term. And the reality is we expect some near-term choppiness as we go through the integration process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, some revenue loss, this synergy was modeled in our base case, not that we\u2019re not going to fight every fight, but we are realistic about what big integrations mean in people businesses and so let\u2019s see how this will play out. There will be some short-term noise, but that\u2019s all it is. It\u2019s noise. The combination of Marsh &amp; McLennan and JLT will prove to be spectacular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The greatest collection of talent and capabilities in our space, improved geographic positioning, higher capacity to invest in the future, things like data and analytics and digital. And our data and analytics flywheel, that I\u2019ve talked about before. I mean, the combination will give us more clients. More clients will create more data. More data will allow us to use analytics to create additional insight and gain more clients. And so in that way, it\u2019s self-perpetuating, so very positive overall. In terms of your follow-up, Mark, it\u2019s \u2013 why don\u2019t you handle that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we see on smaller acquisitions, our convention has been to exclude them from underlying growth for the first year after a deal. But we won\u2019t do that in this case. So we will \u2013 when we report underlying growth going forward, it will be combined MMC and JLT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark McGivney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we want to get to, just so we\u2019re clear. We don\u2019t want to be sitting here internally months from now talking about, well, how did Marsh &amp; McLennan do in Asia in the month of July and then how did JLT do. There is no JLT. There is no Marsh &amp; McLennan. There is the combined organization and we are one. So we want to look at the new organization and the results on a combined basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. And I agree that will be more helpful to analyze. My second question on the margin side, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was anything one-off within Consulting, your other operating expenses declined significantly in the quarter relative to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. I wasn\u2019t sure, if there was something that was driving that or if it\u2019s just less investments and \u2013 like you said in some of your prepared remarks you\u2019re repaying on some of the benefits from the restructuring actions there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s exactly right. I mean as we\u2019ve said before, I wouldn\u2019t look at any one quarter as indicative in terms of the margin trajectory. And I would also reiterate that for us, margin expansion is an outcome of the way we run the business, almost always revenue growth exceeds expense growth and we\u2019re more focused on top line revenue and earnings growth than we are on margin expansion, but we expect continued margin expansion, because of the way we run the business. And 2019, in our view, will be our 12th straight year of margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Phillips</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Thanks everybody. Just I want to dive in deeper a little bit more on the Oliver Wyman, nice momentum in Oliver Wyman in the quarter. It\u2019s kind of continued in the last couple of quarters. And so maybe you can kind of the talk about where you\u2019re seeing that and the expectations going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, sure. And as we\u2019ve said before Oliver Wyman over long stretches of time, will probably be our highest growth operating company but with more volatility because of the nature of the business and the lack of recurring revenue, but Scott you want to add to the comments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Mike. Despite I think what are pretty regular warnings of doom and gloom from economists in the press these days. We see little evidence across almost all sectors and regions. But there is a slowdown in the initiatives, businesses are pursuing, most of the businesses we work with are still focused heavily on growth or transformation or technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Dan has talked about I think many times on this call just how complex the world is becoming. It\u2019s more global, more political, more technology change, more challenges with data and analytics, more challenges around the workforce and all this bodes pretty well for high-end strategy consulting. So our predictions have remained the same. We continue to target mid to high-single digit revenue growth over time. I think you will have seen over the last few years, our revenue can be pretty volatile, but over any long period. That\u2019s what we think we can achieve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Anything else, Mike?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Phillips</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, thank you very much. I appreciate that, that\u2019s good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. Ryan?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey thanks, good morning, guys. First question, just sort of a $0.03 per share headwind from FX. On a year-over-year basis, what was the impact had on the margin?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Mark, you want to take that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark McGivney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ryan, it was a modest benefit to margins, but not anything terribly significant. The biggest driver of margin expansion was operating performance in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then I actually wanted to ask about the whole Medicare for all theme. And I\u2019m curious in markets where the impact that that might have on the Healthcare Consulting business. So maybe you could just give us some perspective in countries where there are single-payer systems, Canada, UK. I guess are you able to have a presence in the Healthcare Consulting, when you have that type of system?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll take that question broadly and then I\u2019ll hand over to Martine to talk a little bit about what we see in markets like Canada and the UK, et cetera. But I\u2019ll just start by saying, Health is a great business for us. In fact, it\u2019s our largest line of business. We\u2019ve got almost $2.5 billion of revenue and almost half of that is in the United States. And clearly, Medicare for all is a hot topic. But what that means and what form that could conceivably take really depends on who is talking about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And for consultants and trusted advisers, uncertainty generally creates opportunities as we \u2013 as clients seek advice. And so we don\u2019t see this in the short-term is any significant headwind or a negative. I mean just to level set for a second, over 180 million Americans receive healthcare benefits through employer-sponsored plans. And generally speaking, those plans are highly subsidized by employers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So more than of the half of the U.S. population is being served by their employers in that way and significant changes if any. And I would stress if any, would be unlikely until 2021, 2022 and that\u2019s really unclear whether there would be any kind of significant change. But in the mean time, we\u2019re certainly going to work diligently to improve availability and affordability to our clients. And for us, I would stress that it\u2019s a global business. And we\u2019re successful globally. So Martine, you want to add something to that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martine Ferland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, certainly. Thank you. And first let me say, I\u2019m excited to taking the helm, and I\u2019m delighted to be here for the first time with you all. So from a Health perspective and you were referring to UK and U.S. in your question, actually I\u2019m very familiar with those being Canadian and having lived in the UK last 8 years. We have striving health businesses in these two countries and in many countries around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Even with universal systems, what we see is there is a need for employer-provided plans where there is supplementary plans, supplementary cover that is being provided. We\u2019re also very active in providing wellness advice, health advise and helping employers manage the cost curve in every country and also helping individuals manage the healthcare system. These are just very often complex system. People in need them at the moment that matters for them, really need help. So as the health becomes more consumerized, we see also opportunities for us to help employees, retirees, individuals manage cost and access the best care they can at the best price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Martine. Next question, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning. First question is from regarding the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, they published their final report this past February, but the wholesale insurance marketplace. I\u2019m curious if the closure of that study changes Marsh\u2019s game plans at all or maybe the study had changed the game plan prior? Maybe perhaps speed up moving into more of those types of facilities and any color there would be great?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I mean, overall, we were pleased with the outcome only really as a result of any time that there is a level of uncertainty, because a big review is taking place. We\u2019re watching it closely. Our view was, it was largely business as usual. Market functioning it\u2019s very competitive. There is new capital formation. There is great client outcomes. But I\u2019ll hand over to John to talk about if it influences Marsh\u2019s strategy at all. John?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Dan. No, I don\u2019t see it changing our strategy going forward at all. We have governance in place and guidelines and philosophies statements around how we get paid, how much we get paid and what that fee income is related to? As Dan said, we were pleased with the outcome. Facilities that we use to place business into in the London market makeup a small, really fraction of our overall placement strategy around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Although, we do think, and it\u2019s a way for us to drive value to our clients ultimately. And as we come together with JLT, we\u2019re learning a little bit more about their approach to it, philosophy to it as well. So we see an opportunity for greater use of facilities, but it won\u2019t be a dominant part of our placement strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Anything else Mike?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. One-off last follow-up, Dan to your comments about P&amp;C pricing moving a little bit north. You mentioned abundant capital, curious if you guys have any theories on what\u2019s causing the move up in rates? I guess the million dollar question for all of investors is it \u2013 is where the rates are just moving up as a result of the increase in loss inflation or is something else going on in terms of the competitive dynamics?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pricing is always a lagging indicator and it is geared toward losses. Ultimately, it\u2019s really a supply and demand market, the higher the losses that underwriters suffer, the more that they actually underwrite, reduce their exposures and that creates some level of supply crunch, which raises rating levels and pricing. And so we\u2019re not in a soft market and we\u2019re not in a hard market. We\u2019re sort of in the shoulder market, but I\u2019ll hand off to the experts both John and Peter to add a little bit more color to the pricing commentary. So John, what you see on the primary side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So as Dan noted earlier, prices going to average is up 3% in the quarter versus 2% in the fourth quarter. In most regions around the world, prices were up 1% to 2%. So as Dan just said it\u2019s not what I would define as a hard market by any stretch. Australia is probably the one exception where prices are up on average in the low-double digit range across various lines of business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Financial lines pricing was up about 6% in the first quarter, just shy of 6%, probably P&amp;L pricing really driving that. And to your question about, why there has been an increase in frequency and severity around securities clients, right. That\u2019s persisted over the last several years. I mean, so underwriters are obviously responding to that and trying to push price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Property pricing largely driven by cat exposed risks and we all know about the cat loss environment for the last couple of years, up about 5% in the quarter. Casualty remains pretty risk, pretty mixed \u2013 excuse me, as you know as longer-tail. Work comp pricing remains down about 5% on average in the U.S. General liability down about 2%, but excess liability pricing is moving up a bit, that was up 3% in the quarter. Auto pricing up 5% in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What I would say is that the market is more challenging for buyers than it\u2019s been in sometime. It\u2019s definitely different than it was three months ago and six months ago. Again, having said that, the average isn\u2019t moving all that much. As Dan said, capital remains abundant and while capacity remains stable, the risk appetite for some underwriters is changing. So, at times we\u2019re seeing lower limits being offered, higher attachment points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In some cases, underwriters are exiting certain classes of business. Now, again, on average we\u2019re getting things done for our clients in the right way. And I don\u2019t see a broad based hard market in front of us. Over time, some risk classes will get mixed price for various reasons. And so I think we\u2019ll see some micro cycles where correction will happen over a short period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, John. So turning to the reinsurance side for some commentary on that, Peter, you want to tell us what\u2019s happening on the reinsurance market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Peter Hearn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Dan. Mike, a lot of the comments that John said pertain to reinsurance as well. I mean, you had $200 billion of losses in 2017 and 2018. And they continue to grow. I think that many of those losses were quantitatively different from those as investors expected. And they included deterioration in the 2017 loss and the loss creep we\u2019ve seen from urban in particular. Losses for un-modeled or under-modeled peril such as wildfire and then losses from human causes such as the assignment of benefits issue that we\u2019ve seen in Florida.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to John\u2019s point, the market has been orderly at 1.1 and 4.1. Yes, we\u2019ve seen increases with loss impacted business, whether it would be Japanese wind. We\u2019re now starting to see the assets of the Florida renewals, where there has been loss impacted layers, there has been rate increase. But I would say overall the market is transitioning. It\u2019s not a hard market. By definition, most people use for hard, but it is certainly transitioning on those lines of business where there have been losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Peter. Next question, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you. I had two quick questions for Martine. First, obviously the restructuring plan going on and Dan mentioned, the potential for distraction associated with the JLT merger. Is the restructuring itself responsible for some of the weakness in Mercer in the first quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So let me talk about that a little bit and then I\u2019ll hand over to Martine. I mean I think in general and as you\u2019ve seen in the past throughout our company, there are periodic periods where we believe as a very large global organization. We have to look at our structure. We have to approach it in a way that always been looking to simplify delayer, focus more on the client, because large companies by their very nature, grow infrastructure and other accouterments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that in my view was more of a normal course type of restructuring effort and whether that has an impact on short-term growth is unlikely. I think the reality is Mercer grew 5% in the first quarter of last year. They had some tough comps and that\u2019s probably at the heart of it. I made the muted comments in my script, because frankly, Martine just got the job. And the last thing I want is for her and her key team to be focused on the next few quarters and delivering some \u2013 what I want them to do is, look at the business, drains out like any new executive team, come up with plans on how to drive sustainable profitable growth over multiple years and that\u2019s really the task at hand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in terms of that JLT, I wouldn\u2019t call it a distraction in any way in terms of integration, whether that\u2019s about RIS or Mercer. But I think it\u2019s more of a recognition that there some areas of the business that might have some revenue breakage and the employee benefit side is probably not one of them. But Martine, do you have anything to add? I think you give much room.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martine Ferland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the question. Well, as Dan just said, I think the elm about two months ago, very excited about it. I think Mercer has unmatched global platform and capabilities. The areas in which we play Health, Wealth, Career, really they address topical issues for society, for enterprises, clients, individuals. Our expertise is very strong, recognized. Our brand is strong and we are leaders in all the countries where we operate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we offer is needed and value for our client. So I do see growth. And many of our business areas are growing well. As Dan and Mark said, we had tough comparables in some places, Health in particular, some are delegated solution and really strong market a quarter \u2013 a year ago. We had strong \u2013 we had good market movement this quarter, but lesser than a quarter ago. Really it\u2019s \u2013 as you all know, the actuarial defined benefit business within Wealth is one area that has a structural decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that said, I believe we can perform better in this area than we have done recently and I come from this business. I have previous experience in it and we\u2019re in the process of implementing changes there in terms of roles, incentives, technology. That will enhance retention and also we invigorate ourselves on the market. And as you know, we are very strong on the delegated solution side. It is absolutely interlinked with our pension business. We have closed $265 billion of assets under management at the end of the quarter by far the leading market leader in that space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Meyer, I think \u2013 any follow-up, I\u2019ll count your restructuring in JLT distractions. It was stated together that as one query. Do you have anything else?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick one. In terms of whether there is any useful rule of thumb relating the Mercer restructuring expenses and the anticipated annualized savings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I mean, ultimately, a lot of the savings will drop to the bottom line. But we\u2019re always looking to invest in the business and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And so \u2013 and there is no rule of thumb associated with that. Next question, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning and thank you. Mike, my questions were really answered. But I guess, maybe I\u2019ll just dig or throw one more out on JLT. I mean, Dan, it seems to me that other large acquisitions in this space. This synergy\u2019s tend to come from people leaving deciding for whatever reason that, they don\u2019t want to continue to be part of the big team and choose to do something else. Is that mostly what we\u2019re talking about here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To me, that is a part of it, but a small part of it. I mean we are getting over 10,000 talented colleagues. Yes, sure, we\u2019ll lose some, who decided they\u2019d rather work in a different environment. But in my view, we were the employer of choice in our industry and our leadership team. Part of their principal job is to create a culture and environment that attracts and retains the top talented people in our space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, I have no doubt that we have a collection of individuals that will form teams that are very solid in the marketplace and really on a top talent basis. I think, when I look over any kind of stretch of time, I imagine, when you think about a mid to long-term time horizon, anything we\u2019re talking about potential revenue breakage will largely be meaningless in the overall scheme of things. But it could create a headwind in the short term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll just give you a couple of easy examples. You might have a retail client within Marsh and JLT, where the clients themselves always had two brokers and they want two brokers, okay. Some clients choose to do that. Other clients want [indiscernible] (46:03) strength of a very strategic organization to organization relationship. But if you add a client that wants two brokers. And one of those brokers is JLT and one of those brokers is Marsh right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, then there\u2019s going to be some activity there or you might have some wholesale business where U.S. third-party broker that used JLT in London, because they didn\u2019t view JLT as a competitor in the U.S. All of a sudden, they view Marsh as a competitor in the U.S. And so maybe they\u2019ll have some challenge about whether, okay, how are you guys going into one the business to where you can still service our needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re going to do the best we can, best endeavors to try to do that and keep things separate and run businesses in a way that we always put our clients\u2019 interests first even when that client might actually be a competitor in some other part of our organization. But what we are really, like I said, ultimately, I think that this will be a meaningless number when we look over the course of a few years. Ultimately, clients choose best talent. The best talent and capabilities will win, not about any what badges or name is on the building.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. That\u2019s helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. I know, you guys have shied away from giving any targets around cost saves and the like, but just given the meaningful impact that we\u2019re seeing here in Consulting on the margin front. Is there anything you could say about the cost saves from the current restructuring?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, the overall restructuring is in that $70 million to maybe $80 million level. Most of its already been done. So what you\u2019re seeing is some roll forward on that it would be natural have more savings early after restructuring than later because the level of investments are not having \u2013 not necessarily occurring simultaneously with the restructuring. But ultimately, this was not a large restructuring in the overall scheme of things. There will be savings, which dropped to the bottom-line as we\u2019ve always done that, we\u2019ve been very disciplined about that. What I would overall focus on is the fact that our margin has expanded dramatically over many years. I mean, the company\u2019s margin is up something like 700 bps in the last five years. And so, we have continual margin expansion as we run the business properly. And we see margin expansion in 2019 as we said in the script.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I switch over to RIS, I think, MMA now accounts for about a third of your U.S. revenues in Marsh. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s going to get diluted a little bit through JLT, but is there a number or a portion of the business that you would like it to be or that you would not wanted to cross?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is a couple of things. One JLT is quite, quite modest in the U.S., so it won\u2019t have a real overall impact on the various percentages. And no, we want MMA to continue to grow. We think that there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s still a very fragmented space. The largest part of the market when you look at the vast middle market, however you define it \u2013 it\u2019s a terrific sweet spot for the company. We\u2019ve built what we believe is the finest national platform in the middle market and we will continue to look at that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is no end in sight and we certainly wouldn\u2019t create a constraint on MMA in order to create some percentage between large accounts and national brokerage and MMA. It\u2019s like we will go wherever the market will bear. And it\u2019s not just in the United States, I mean, Marsh, John and his team and Peter before that have done a very good job of maintaining our position and growing our position in the large accounts space, while growing faster in the vast middle market in many countries around the world. And so Marsh is becoming much more like a pyramid as opposed to top-heavy with regard to just in risk management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to touch base a little bit more on the potential [indiscernible] (51:09) with JLT. Is it fair to say that the places that you\u2019re most likely see some organic growth slow are the places with the most combined market share? And if maybe you could \u2013 if that\u2019s the case maybe to sort of give some thoughts on where we might see it or not see it if it all things go well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think you guys are all sort of overstating it as an issue. As I just said, over the course of any kind of mid-term basis, we\u2019re looking at something, which would be a meaningless type of number. And we modeled it within our deal costs anyway. I mean, I think the obvious thing would be if you look at RIS, that\u2019s where most of JLT exist, that\u2019s where most of the integration takes place. But, we\u2019re not looking at big numbers. And by the way, we did model any revenue synergy into this deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve expressed before the notion that we absolutely expect some revenue synergy as JLT clients, existing JLT clients have access to things like Oliver Wyman, Mercer Investment, Mercer Career, some of the digital capabilities and data and analytic capabilities within Marsh. But we\u2019re a conservative company the deal model, stood on its own. And so therefore, we didn\u2019t model that, but we\u2019ve been surprised positively about many of the things we have seen within JLT. And I start with the idea that the quality of the people is very high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our view about how we go forward is we\u2019re a people business and the greatest degree of high quality, talented, creative, diligent, hardworking people working as a team creates more value for our clients and ultimately for our colleagues in career path and our shareholders as well. There is a few things that we\u2019ve been happy about that we did not expect. As an example, Mercer has extensive operations in India, which support their business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is much less so in Marsh and Guy Carpenter, but interestingly, JLT actually has a pretty high degree of integration in their operating model in India. And that gives us mid-term possibilities for Marsh and Guy Carpenter that would be easier to capture than if we just did this on our own in. Other things that we\u2019ve seen, while obviously compensation is always different in organizations and then people business is vitally important.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The methodology in how we look at compensation and the team-based way of how we look at client service and profitability is very similar between the two organizations. And that contrasts with certain other organizations that put the individual producer and individual production at the top of the compensation model. In our company, that\u2019s different, and I\u2019m happy to say the JLT was as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I would just say, there\u2019s tremendous optimism and energy within Marsh &amp; McLennan right now to welcome our JLT colleagues. And we will deliver not we \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re not promising perfection. These are big companies coming together, but any noise will be short-term. And we certainly expect over time that 3% to 5% growth or higher will be delivered. We just wanted to be upfront and say, but don\u2019t forget, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. So next question, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That makes sense. Obviously, you have a great track record with making acquisitions. It also similarly, as you go through the process. Are there any pieces that might end up being divested or slowdown or they also affect the revenue as we look forward with go buy company?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, when we \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say, like I said, there is no JLT anymore. What there is a combined organization that is coming together and forming a new organization. We are the \u2013 we\u2019re the largest start up in the world. And so, when I look at it, we always look at parts of our business. Our entire business, in a way of saying, where the low growth, low-margin business is. And we always create challenge as to whether those businesses are required or not?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we would do that across our entire organization, the broader organization, which is both Marsh &amp; McLennan and legacy JLT. Put them all together, and we create quadrants, as you know, high-growth, high-margin; high growth, low-margin; low margin, low growth and et cetera. And so ultimately, that\u2019s a continual process and you\u2019ve seen us over the years. Every once in a while, divest in asset almost in all ways, it\u2019s in that low growth or low margin category and you\u2019ll see us continue to do that as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Cohen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, maybe questions for Mark, some modeling questions. Mark, you\u2019ve given us the interest expense for the 2Q. Can you talk about the corresponding investment income from the proceeds that you should expect to see?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark McGivney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Jay, as I said, we had $25 million of interest income on the cash that was sitting around in escrow. But at this point, it\u2019s all been deployed. And so going forward, I\u2019d expect minimal amount of interest income, sort of what we\u2019ve seen in the past and whatever corporate cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Cohen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Go it. That makes sense. Quarterly amortization expense post deal, can you give us a sense of that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark McGivney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I said in my script, Jay, that along with a number of other elements of our model, we\u2019re really in the process of updating our perspective on. So, at the last guidance we\u2019ve given is $180 million on a post-tax basis. And for now, that\u2019s where the number stands. But as we \u2013 between now and the second quarter that you\u2019ll see some pro forma information come out as required. On June 11, we\u2019ll be required to file a pro forma that will have after JLT for 2018 with pro forma adjustments. Purchase accounting will be one of them. So, you\u2019ll get a little bit more information when that\u2019s filed. And then on our next call, I\u2019d expect to update those elements of guidance that we\u2019ve given in the past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from David Styblo from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Styblo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, there. Good morning, thanks for the questions and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just come back to JLT for a second and I appreciate the prudently cautious comments about just bumps and being forward about that. I guess, I\u2019m more curious about how the customer experience is and engagement has been about opportunities? You\u2019ve touched on a couple of them to start to go down that path. But I would like to hear more about what the customer response has been and some of the opportunities that you guys would have to cross-sell and provide more services as a deeper share of wallet within the customer base?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I mean, it\u2019s a great question and actually, the initial client response, since the deal announcement has been incredibly positive and RIMS is coming up. So, why don\u2019t I ask John to go into that a little bit more detail? So, what do you seeing John, what are you hearing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Initial feedback has been quite positive. I have spoken myself to a couple of dozen clients in the last couple of weeks, including a few yesterday and the feedback has been quite positive. Many of these relationships, of course, overlap. So, wasn\u2019t a first time introduction for me with a number of clients that I engaged with. Obviously, we were competitors just three weeks ago, right. So, we\u2019re still just starting out how the value proposition will change, but there are real opportunities for cross-sell, right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">JLT in a lot of ways, although a big company operated like a specialty boutique and we had a kind of a broader view of the client relationship. And so those relationships are often fitting together quite nicely. And as Dan pointed out earlier, I want to make sure their teams will be in place, right. The people have they\u2019ve hired in the past will continue to serve them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I was in London on day one and for the first week and Lucy Clarke, who comes from JLT and now leads Marsh\u2019s Specialty Operations, Marsh JLT Specialty. She and I worked together most of the week. We are also really quite encouraged literally on the first day. We had teams in the market together, working on accounts. There is nothing more than those kind of experience to accelerate kind of the socialization that needs to happen between the two teams.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as Dan said, RIMS starts on Sunday. And so the masses will descend upon Boston. We will bring a bit of an army ourselves. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us to spend some time with our colleagues, new colleagues from JLT. But we have 1,500 client meetings scheduled from Monday through the end of day, Wednesday. And it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to get feedback, and so we\u2019ve got some systematic ways of doing that, and then, of course, more informal feedback. But at the end of next week, we\u2019ll have a much more data on it but we\u2019re off to a good start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Styblo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks. And then real quick, I knew these are smaller businesses within Marsh geographically, but Latin America, Asia Pacific, the organic growth was really quite strong. And I think, Latin America, the 11% was for some in double-digits for a couple of years. So curious to hear about anything particular, driving that broad-based products or services? So\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, Latin America \u2013 I mean within Marsh, Latin America has been the highest growth region in the aggregate for the last decade. But, John, anything in particular?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, I was pleased with the start to the year for sure. I do think we\u2019re getting a little bit of lift from pricing to be clear. But some of the leadership changes that we\u2019ve made are taking hold in some parts of the world. So I\u2019ve been pleased with that. As you all know, and we underway a simplification effort a year ago and moved some talent to faster growing areas. I think that\u2019s contributing to increased growth. But I\u2019m pleased with our \u2013 the execution of our strategy and the focus on client segmentation. New business is improving and most of the world, last three is improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some of the faster growing kind of specialties if you will, are transaction risks, cyber very good quarter in aviation. Our Energy business has performed well in the first quarter, as did our Credit Specialties. Our MGA business is also growing nicely as well. So, it\u2019s pretty broad-based, good start to the year. Latin America and Asia, I do expect over time to grow faster than the rest of Marsh.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to your host, Mr. Glaser, for any additional or closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Glaser</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining the call this morning. And particularly, I\u2019d like to welcome more than 10,000 JLT colleagues to Marsh &amp; McLennan. I\u2019d like to thank our clients for their support and our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving them. I hope all of you have a great day. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That will conclude today\u2019s call.
