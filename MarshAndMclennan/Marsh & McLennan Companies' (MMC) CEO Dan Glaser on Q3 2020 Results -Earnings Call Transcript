Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today.</p> <p>I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh &amp; McLennan. Joining me on the call today<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We are pleased with<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the continued strong execution and resilience of Marsh &amp; McLennan in these challenging times. The economic impact of the pandemic continues to unfold. Governments swiftly provided necessary stimulus earlier this year and societies adapting as healthcare professionals continue to drive better health outcomes. Nevertheless, the consequences are likely to be with us for some time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is not a sprint or even a 10-K. It is a marathon. Oliver Wyman\u2019s pandemic navigator model and experts currently predict that even in the more optimistic scenarios, where a vaccine or therapeutics are developed and available, we are still unlikely to return to more normal conditions before the end of 2021. At Marsh &amp; McLennan, we are prepared for the long-haul. The company has been resilient amidst the challenges of 2020. We are experiencing one of the worst recessions in history and our performance to-date is nothing short of outstanding in the circumstances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in moments that matter. We\u2019ve done just that by helping clients with issues of the day, including healthcare solutions, risk management, cyber, climate, enhanced resilience, digital transformation, diversity strategies among others. Our focus on risk, strategy and people is more critical than ever and our colleagues have demonstrated incredible dedication and agility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Supporting our colleagues is always a major priority and is even more critical during the pandemic. Just last week, we received the results of our most recent calling engagement survey. Our support has been validated by the results, which showed record engagement scores. Looking at our execution during this period, it\u2019s been impressive. At Marsh, our year-to-date underlying growth is 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Guy Carpenter is having a strong year with 6% underlying growth for the first nine months. Consulting has experienced more of an adverse impact. We are pleased the effects are not as severe as we saw during the financial crisis. The expense discipline across the firm has allowed us to achieve strong margin expansion and 9% adjusted EPS growth year-to-date. Our solid earnings growth coupled with a firm-wide focused on working capital is driving significant free cash flow enabling us to increase our dividend complete acquisitions and remain largely on track with our de-leveraging plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We achieved all this while at the same time, continuing to position the company for the long-term. We are pursuing strategic hires and seeing opportunity to benefit from industry consolidation. We continue to build out MMA through acquisition with 2020 seeing the most revenue acquired and capital deployed since we launched the business in 2009, and the pipeline is solid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition opportunities to benefit from new areas of growth, increase our penetration of existing markets, as well as achieve higher levels of efficiency. with the heavy lifting from the JLT integration, well behind us, we are connected, unified and focused on growth in all dimensions. We are executing well and I see opportunity to emerge from this period even stronger. The crisis proved that our workforce is agile and there was opportunity over the long-term to operate with greater flexibility, increase the use of technology, reduce travel, and shrink our real estate footprint. This will not only drive savings for shareholders, but increase colleague satisfaction and enhance our ability to bring the best of Marsh &amp; McLennan to every client situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In some ways, the crisis acted as a natural accelerant for collaboration and cross business activity. We are increasingly bringing together our businesses to help clients. For example, COVID-19 increased the cyber risk profile of nearly every firm and our businesses are working hand in hand to deliver holistic cyber advisory and insurance solutions to aid in mitigation, response and remediation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are also bringing the businesses together to help clients address the climate risk. Marsh\u2019s consulting, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter came together recently held a major international bank, analyze and create a mitigation strategy on climate risk. Mercer, Oliver Wyman and Marsh\u2019s consulting continue to come together to assist clients with return to office initiatives in the face of the global pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By leveraging their combined data, we are providing clients with operational support, predictive models for reopening, financial planning, communication strategies, and overall benefit reviews. Underpinning these initiatives is the proprietary data and analytics from Oliver Wyman\u2019s pandemic navigator model, which was recently recognized as one of the most accurate predictive models of COVID-19 cases and fatalities, and it\u2019s utilized by the CVC. These are just some of the examples of the collaboration and innovation that support our continued growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me spend a moment on current P&amp;C insurance market conditions. The third quarter marks the 12th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&amp;C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index increased 20% year-over-year versus 19% in the second quarter and 14% in the first quarter. Global property insurance was up 21%, and global financial and professional lines were up 40% while global casualty rates are up 6% on average and workers\u2019 compensation pricing remain negative in the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Keep in mind, our index used to large account business. However U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to accelerate as well. Although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts. Pricing continues to react to multiple external headwinds impacting insurer profitability and this is only exacerbated by COVID-19 losses, which continued to evolve. COVID-19 will be a law in complicated loss and the interpretation of various policyholder wordings will be determined in the courts over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In reinsurance, price increases evidenced at the 4/1 Japan renewals and 6/1 Florida renewals continued into the 10/1 renewals. These were larger increases than at January 1, but primarily driven by loss impacted business. Guy Carpenter\u2019s U.S. rate online index was up 12% year-over-year in July reflecting reduced alternative capital inflows, constrained retrocessional capacity and traditional reinsurers exercising caution regarding the amount of capital they are willing to expose in the face of wind, wildfire and developing COVID-19 losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are currently near the tail end of one of the most active hurricane seasons in U.S. history with a record level of named storms, making landfall while numerous aggregate losses were thankfully not as severe as they could have been. The P&amp;C insurance and reinsurance markets overall are showing a heightened degree of scrutiny and risk selection with continue push for higher pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the advocates for the client, we remain steadfast in our goal to deliver the highest quality coverage at the best possible terms. And these challenging market conditions highlight the value of the advice and services that Marsh &amp; McLennan delivers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6%, despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our EPS growth in the quarter reflects great execution on the part of our colleagues and continued expense discipline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total revenue was unchanged versus a year ago at $4 billion and down 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 2% in RIS and declined 4% in consulting. In Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, an increase of 4%. Underlying revenue growth was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting solid growth of 3% in Marsh and flat at Guy Carpenter, which overcame a previously disclosed $17 million one-time benefit in the year-ago period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">RIS adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 280 basis points versus a year ago. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. Underlying revenue declined by 4% for the quarter. Oliver Wyman immerses career business continue to feel the greatest impact from recessionary conditions. Consulting adjusted operating income declined by 5% and the adjusted margin expanded 20 basis points versus a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, adjusted operating income increased 9% versus a year ago to $638 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4% adjusted earnings per share increased 6% versus a year ago to $0.82 per share. Even though the impact with COVID-19 may be far from over, our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance is evidence that we are executing well in this challenging environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given our excellent third quarter performance, our full-year outlook has improved. for the full-year 2020, we now expect underlying revenue to be roughly flat with growth in RIS offset by a decline in Consulting. In addition, we expect to generate mid single-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark McGivney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Dan and good morning. We\u2019re pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the resilience of our business as well as how well we are executing through the crisis. Despite a modest decline and underlying revenue in the quarter, we generated solid earnings growth, strong free cash flows and margin expansion in both segments. Overall revenue was flat in the third quarter and declined 1% on an underlying basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating income in the quarter was $540 million, an increase of 15% over last year. adjusted operating income increased 9% to $638 million and our adjusted margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP EPS increased to $0.62 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $0.82. for the first nine months of 2020, total revenue growth was 3% with underlying growth of 1%. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 180 basis points to 23.8% and our adjusted EPS increased 9% to $3.77.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">in Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue grew 4% to $2.3 billion with underlying growth of 2%. A decline in fiduciary interest income driven by lower interest rates served as 100 basis point drag on underlying growth in the third quarter and 60 basis point drag for the nine months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">operating income increased 52% to $333 million. adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted margin increased 280 basis points to 20.2%. for the first nine months of the year, RIS revenue was $7.8 billion, representing growth of 8% and underlying growth of 3%. adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 20% to $2.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2 billion with underlying growth of 3% representing another solid quarter of growth considering the macroeconomic headwinds. U.S. and Canada grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter. The U.S. and Canada has delivered 3% or higher underlying growth. In international underlying growth was 2% with Asia Pacific up 4%, Latin America up 2% and EMEA flat. For the first nine months, revenue at Marsh was $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.s. and Canada was up 4% while international was up 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Guy Carpenter continues to have a great year. Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $274 million in the quarter, which was flat on both the reported and underlying basis. As we disclosed previously, Guy Carpenter\u2019s growth in the third quarter of last year benefited from the true-up of a multi-year contract. Excluding this item, underlying growth was 6% in the quarter and reflects continued solid results across the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $1.5 billion, 6% underlying growth. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. underlying revenue was down 4% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the current crisis. adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $306 million while the adjusted margin increased 20 basis points to 18.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the first nine months of the year, Consulting\u2019s revenue was $5.1 billion, down 2% on an underlying basis and adjusted operating income declined 6% to $860 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mercer\u2019s revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue decreased 3% led by a decline in DB. within wealth however, we continue to see growth in the outsourced CIO business and at the end of the quarter, our assets under management were approximately $321 billion. This 5% sequential increase was driven by strong new funding and marketing. health underlying growth is flat in the quarter and career underlying revenue was down 11%. Careers, where we have more discretionary projects business, which is seeing the most impact from the crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $3.6 billion, down 1% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue was $480 million in the quarter, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. This marks an improvement from the pace of decline in the second quarter, and reflects stronger sales and continued solid delivery of projects. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to corporate. Adjusted corporate expense was $56 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $58 million in the fourth quarter. We had $2 million of investment income on an adjusted basis in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance of 2020 will be immaterial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a GAAP basis, investment income was a loss of $14 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a change in the market value of our remaining investment in Alexander Forbes. foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a slight benefit in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.5% compared with 25% in the third quarter last year. excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6%, compared with 24.3% last year, and we expect the full-year rate to be between 25% and 26% due in part to an expected impact from discrete items in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the JLT integration, I\u2019m happy to report that the bulk of integration activity is largely behind this, and we have achieved the vast majority of the targeted savings, which is well ahead of schedule. We incurred $44 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the third quarter, bringing the total to-date to $516 million. The remaining work to be done consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate, which will continue through 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for 2020. our 2020 outlook assumes recessionary conditions persist for the rest of the year. Despite this headwind, we expect RIS to generate underlying revenue growth for the full year offset by a decline in Consulting. at Marsh, we see underlying growth in the low single digits for Q4 and the full year, a solid result in the face of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">at Guy carpenter, we continue to expect mid single-digit underlying growth for the full year. Guy Carpenter\u2019s fourth quarter could be impacted by difficult comparisons to last year although Q4 is a seasonally small quarter. We continue to expect Mercer\u2019s underlying revenue will decline in the fourth quarter and be down modestly for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman will persist through the fourth quarter. As we learn to live with the virus, we are progressively moving to a more normal course for business decisions. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings will be impacted by a sequential uptick in expenses due to a general loosening of spending restrictions, strategic hiring, and costs associated with employee related activity that would have taken place over the course of the year, but was delayed due to the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite this, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the year to mid single-digit growth. In addition, based on this outlook, we expect our overall margin will increase, which would Mark our 13th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash, saw a sequential reduction in outstanding debt and have the entirety of our combined $2.8 billion of credit facilities available.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain committed to deleveraging and we continue to expect to reduce overall debt this year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $12.7 billion, down from $13.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the repayment of a $500 million one-year term loan ahead of its schedule maturity. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December when 700 million of senior notes mature.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Interest expense in the third quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $127 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. While uncertainty remains high in the current environment, we feel the actions we have taken to secure additional flexibility along with our strong performance to-date positions us well to continue to navigate the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter and do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $295 million and included $59 million for acquisitions, and $236 million for dividends. for the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $1.5 billion and included $753 million for acquisitions and $702 million for dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We are on track to deliver a solid year, despite the ongoing global pandemic. our results reflect the strength and resilience of our company and our colleagues, and we remain focused on striking the right balance between delivering solid results today while continuing to invest for growth in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Glaser</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark. and operator, we\u2019re ready to go to the Q&amp;A.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. I guess I\u2019d love to hear more about parts of the consulting segment. That seems to be the area with a higher level of organic growth uncertainty, where we\u2019re getting most of our questions incoming from investors. You\u2019ll clearly improve margins there in the segment despite negative organic growth. Maybe, you can talk about some things that drove that the sustainability; is there more or less uncertainty in that segment going forward, given the pandemic seems to be causing some shutdowns again in Europe, so a broad question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Sure, Mike. I\u2019d start by saying; we\u2019re we lucky to have a variety of businesses within Marsh &amp; McLennan. With many consulting, as an example, we\u2019d have businesses which have high degrees of recurring revenues, such as our health business and our investment business parts of our retirement actuarial business as an example. we have other parts of our consulting business like Marsh\u2019s career business and Oliver Wyman, which are more project based. And then project-based work has an awful lot to do with general economic conditions and business confidence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it is a natural outcome for us to feel pressure on those businesses in times of recession or in times where there\u2019s a high level of uncertainty, but we can navigate it as a total company and we understand that businesses. they are terrific businesses, market-leading fantastic businesses, and they make the overall company smarter as well. So, from our perspective, it\u2019s the grouping together that matters the most and certainly, businesses that have less recurring revenue and more project work are under more pressure on times like these and that will continue, so that is \u2013 we felt it during the financial crisis and we\u2019ll feel it now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, the bounce back can be very swift, because as soon as the turn happens and companies get back into business as usual, return to growth type of mode. Then that work picks up. I\u2019m happy to say that both of those businesses are holding up better than during the financial crisis. because in the beginning of this crisis, we weren\u2019t sure whether that would be the case or not and it has turned out that those businesses have proved to be more resilient than they were during the financial crisis. Anything else, Mike?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I\u2019ll switch gears to property and casualty insurance, rate increase momentum has accelerated. And I think a lot of your clients are seeing double-digit rate increases year-on-year now. for some of the carriers that doesn\u2019t seem to be translating into as much top-line growth as we expected, even taking into account weak exposures. I mean, are you guys seeing more of your clients self-insure and just kind of \u2013 are you guys having to do more work there is that impacting your Marsh &amp; McLennan at all? It feels like there\u2019s \u2013 the market\u2019s just so tough and challenging in certain places that corporates are \u2013 you\u2019re having to help corporates to offset some of the pain per se.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It\u2019s a great question and I\u2019ll hand off to John in a second to address this, because it\u2019s really Marsh question more than a Guy Carpenter one. The Marsh is tough and we\u2019re on the side of the client, and we\u2019re advocating for the client doing the best we can in the circumstances, in some ways, some level of the increases in certain parts of the business, are probably justified based upon loss levels and a soft market environment that has persisted for years. Although we don\u2019t like the speed of the increases, ultimately, I don\u2019t think that benefits the market or benefits our clients, when it snaps back in such a \u2013 in times harsh way. particularly, in this kind of environment, where clients, in certain industries, are really feeling a lot of pressure on revenue and survival, and then being hit with large levels of insurance increases, it\u2019s a real tough environment and we\u2019re doing our best for our clients in the circumstances. And John, do you want to add to that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Dan. Mike, I think obviously, every transaction\u2019s got the mix of different factors that drive the outcome for our clients. That\u2019s a very, very challenging market for them, especially given the atomic environment. So, we have putting aside the price and exposure aspect of what drives the ultimate premium that gets charged to the client. Some clients are being forced to retain more risk; it\u2019s fewer, but whether it\u2019s through higher retentions or in very, very few circumstances, where we can\u2019t get the limit that we would like, or that our client would like, but with some level of frequency, clients are electing to retain more risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it could be a higher retention. It could be bindless limit in certain cases, for example, in the D&amp;O market, where there is a meaningful amount of stress in the U.S., UK and Australia, in particular, some clients are electing to buy A side only coverage; or where they do buy some B and C cover, they take down the limits, where they do by B and C. And so we obviously work with our clients very, very closely and are working hard to present their risks as best we can to drive the best possible outcome. And the other dynamic I would mention as well is we are seeing an increase in the number of captive formations as well. So, a lot of different strategies, obviously helping our clients navigate the market as best we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Nice quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I guess starting on the revenue outlook within RIS and maybe, I\u2019m zoning in, on Marsh strong results there, I guess, given on the backdrop that you alluded to Dan, in your opening remarks, how do we think about like, do you think the Q2 and the Q3 for that business specifically, I\u2019m talking to Marsh represented the kind of the trough of the slowdown from COVID. I know there\u2019s a lot of obviously uncertainty out there, but when we think about the fourth quarter and into 2021, I know you said that these conditions can persist into the end of 2021, but how should we think about that business specifically? It seems like it\u2019s been pretty resilient and could the Q2 and Q3 be the trough and could we start thinking about things getting better just based off of what you know today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Okay. So, it\u2019s a terrific question. And I\u2019ll start with it. and then I\u2019ll hand off to John and also Peter, so they can address it in more depth. I\u2019d start by saying we\u2019re thrilled with RIS\u2019s performance and yes, they have proved to be tremendously resilient market leading flight to quality types of attributes and I want to make one point, because fiduciary income is often ignored in the mix here and you just look at RIS\u2019s underlying growth, 3% in the third quarter, rather than 2% and 4% year-to-date if I exclude fiduciary income. the reality is fiduciary income has dropped in half year-to-date, there was $80 million within RIS and now it\u2019s $40 million. So, you look at our performance, not just top-line, but more specifically on the bottom line in overcoming the loss of that fiduciary income and growing through it, it was really an overall terrific performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, getting to your real question is like is the worst over. I have to say it\u2019s really impossible to say. We all want to say it, but it\u2019s impossible to say that it\u2019s only going to get better from here so much depends on COVID and the government response and the economic implications of any government response and so it\u2019s really too early to say that we\u2019re out of the woods. As we mentioned in our remarks, our experts within Oliver Wyman, who advised many governments, et cetera are really thinking that at the earliest, this model returned to what feels like normal, kind of this time next year. And so this is a long haul and we have to be prepared for the long haul. I think that one of the things that we can say, not only as Marsh &amp; McLennan, but also as a society, we are resilient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are learning. we are adapting and it should get better from here. 2021 should, in a macro basis, get better from here. And as you know, many of the prognosis on 2021 is that recession sometime, second, third quarter of 2021. And so it should be better, but it\u2019s very difficult to call the trough. What I would say is we will grind through and power through any scenario. We will grow our revenue in almost all circumstances faster than we grow our expenses as we\u2019ve done for 12 or 13 years in a row that will continue. But John, why don\u2019t we start with you and then hand over to Peter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. thanks, Dan. Look, I was pleased with our results. our team is highly focused and I\u2019m very, very proud of them and what are very different circumstances for folks on a personal level, but also in a very, very difficult insurance market. Our U.S. business continues to grow well. Dan mentioned and Mark mentioned that the growth at MMA was very strong. Canada\u2019s performing very well. Our MGA operations at Victor\u2019s, we\u2019re the largest MGA in the world performing quite nicely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">internationally, I\u2019m seeing good growth in Asia, in the middle East and Africa as well and a number of different specialties. Some are under pressure, of course, aviation and energy, as you might expect. But FINPRO is growing very well, construction actually, a good quarter for us. We grew nicely in credit lines as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mentioned earlier with Mike, some clients are deciding to buy a less insurance, one exception to that is in cyber. So, our cyber business is growing very, very well at the moment and we\u2019re seeing particularly in the U.S. and in the UK, our clients elect to buy more limit there. So, as Dan pointed out, it\u2019s difficult to project where things go, but I\u2019m confident in our ability to perform relatively well. The other point I would make is just we\u2019re as deep and as strong as we\u2019ve ever been from a talent point of view. last year was a big year of change for us bringing JLT and Marsh together. We did a lot of work on our culture and becoming a team, and we weren\u2019t doing it of course, in anticipation of a pandemic, but we really were coming together very, very nicely at a time when our clients need us the most. And so anyway, the teamwork there has been outstanding. Peter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Peter, I mean, it\u2019s hard to talk about potential trough with you at 6% year-to-date, it is a \u2013 that\u2019s a trough, I'll take it, but any comments Peter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Peter Hearn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. As I\u2019ve said before, we built Guy Carpenter to produce consistent results regardless of the market conditions. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that over the past three years, and while Q3 and Q4 tend to be seasonally small and by nature inherently volatile. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our flat result given the fact that we had this one-time, multi-year true up from 2019 plus some negative timing. And on a normalized basis, we would have grown 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, when I look at the year, when I look at the environment that we\u2019re operating in, where there\u2019s still a high degree of fear and uncertainty based on both prior years and the unknown relative to COVID-19. I think Guy Carpenter is well positioned. And then as I look at our new business growth for 2020, we\u2019re on track for our fourth year of record, new business growth. So overall, I feel very good of how \u2013 where Guy Carpenter is positioned in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Elyse, any follow-ups?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. thanks. That was very thorough. My next question is on the margin side, really good margin improvement, given the headwinds as well, 150 basis points in the third quarter overall, 180 year-to-date. Obviously, that\u2019s a function of some JLT saves, some COVID-related savings that you guys have alluded to. I\u2019m just trying to extrapolate this. So, 150 in the Q3, you guys have said margin improvement for the year. So that leaves a bit of a range for the \u2013 how the fourth quarter could turn out. just trying to think about the JLT saves, as well as some COVID saves that could persist, like how should we think about kind of the expense profile that there were some one-time items in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. it\u2019s another good question. And it\u2019s a fair question, because we\u2019re basically saying we\u2019re at 9% growth of adjusted EPS growth year-to-date and will be mid single digit to the year, but for the year is not in our outlook? So, it sort of says, well, what\u2019s happening in the fourth quarter? So, it\u2019s a fair question. And I would just say, there was some loosening of expense controls in Q3 and we\u2019re going, and that will increase in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are getting back progressively to a more normal pattern of our business and that will mean that there\u2019ll be more hiring. Hiring is down this year. Our own level of turnover as a company is down relative to the years past. There\u2019ll be some employee related actions as we position ourselves for 2021. And there\u2019s some pent-up demand and some catch-ups that will happen in the fourth quarter, but if you take a step back from this, I just want to say that every company has sort of a natural cadence to both revenue and expense. And as we have demonstrated over many years, we understand that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so therefore, in every single year, our revenue growth of upward down as we\u2019ve seeded out our expense results. And when I look at our typical level of underlying expense growth, you look at the last five years, four of those five years, then there was 2% expense growth on an annual basis underlying, okay. Including 2% in 2019 and 2% in the first quarter of 2020 claims. So, 2% could be looked at as a natural sort of cadence of expense growth and that\u2019s why we were having really good results over the last couple of years, because we were growing top line at 4% and we were having expense growth at 2% underlying as an overall company. In the second quarter of this year, we went from 2% growth on expense in the first quarter to minus five underlying expense growth in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So clearly, we would hold back on discretionary expense and we set a high bar for what was actually necessary and required. in the third quarter, that became the minus four. So that\u2019s going to continue. I\u2019m not going to say whether it\u2019s a minus three, minus two, minus one, it\u2019s probably still going to be a minus, right. So, we are not going to grow expenses in the fourth quarter, year-over-year. But our expense growth will sequentially go up versus the third quarter, which also end up versus the \u2013 where we were in the second quarter. So, that\u2019s sound, the right way to look at it from my perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Stefano</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So Dan, you had talked about in your \u2013 I think it was your prepared remarks, the potential for an uptake and expense actions that were delayed throughout the year and just thinking about all the uncertainties that we have in the world. And I think they\u2019re totally understandable and warranted, but what gives you the confidence or the thought to start bringing back expenses and how do we think about the unfolding of catch-up over the next year or two, as we get to whatever normal is in that timeframe?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. well, we all exist in the world, right. So at the end, our performance in part will reflect what\u2019s happening with regard to the virus and what\u2019s happening with regards to the general economic environment. I\u2019m not saying that things with the virus are getting materially better. I do think that health outcomes are materially better than they were in the early stages of the virus, because doctors and healthcare professionals have adapted, they\u2019ve learned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so oftentimes, the results have been better. Hospitalizations are quite, not quite as severe and fatality globally are generally well down. It\u2019s not the make line-up of any illness. I mean, an illness is an illness, but I think more importantly, the world is learning to live with the virus a bit. And so investment decisions are being made thoughts about next year and the year after are being made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The idea that the sun will rise in the future, that is the thought process within companies. And so our feeling is 2021 on a macro basis should be better. It may not be materially better, but it should be better than 2020. And then the other thing is we have now two quarters to look at where we were in this second of this crisis and look how our businesses performed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our expectations were exceeded on both top and bottom line. Our consulting business held up it is non-recurring parts of it better than our expectations. Our RIS business, both in Marsh and Guy Carpenter have done phenomenally well in the circumstances. And our year-to-date result is very strong. So, that is our all learning from that and adaptability has given us the confidence to step out a little bit and say, okay, let\u2019s \u2013 we won\u2019t return fully to normal operations. And we\u2019re still largely remote working, but progressively moving towards something that can feel a little bit more like normal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Like as an example we do performance appraisals every year, near the end of the year. We\u2019re going to do that this year. We\u2019ll do the same thing. And yes, maybe even be a little bit more awkward because it\u2019s over Zoom and everything else like that in terms of having discussions. But it\u2019s important for people to know, they\u2019re either on track or off track doing a great job or not. And so we\u2019re going to continue with that, the more \u2013 in more areas than the HR, but really across the piece digital transformation work, where I\u2019m working on further integration activities. We find out this pressing ahead and going forward with some of the things that we delayed in the second and early parts of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Stefano</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you. And thinking about the out-performance at least based on our expectations for RIS and organic, I was hoping you could just help us think about, the economic benefit versus maybe what we feared a couple of months ago versus potential implications from two of your larger competitors going through a merger and any benefits that that may have?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, in terms of, as I indicated in my initial remarks, our performance this year has been nothing short of outstanding. And that, and I\u2019m saying that as a total company, RIS maybe in particular for total company, I mean, the protection of shareholders in the Consultant segment in a year where they\u2019re challenged on the top line is remarkable and appreciated, and we\u2019re continuing to execute well through Mercer and Oliver Wyman. So, I think as an overall company, like I said, it\u2019s nothing short of outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of our competitors that we\u2019re running our own, right. And we are focused on serving clients like never before they need us now, more than ever before, and supporting our colleagues in, standing up for each other. We wouldn\u2019t trade our strategic positioning with anyone. And we believe that we will benefit from consolidation as clients and industry professionals consider their options in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jimmy Bhullar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. So, I have a couple of questions along the same lines of the discussion earlier. But any comments on the project pipeline at Mercer and Oliver Wyman? I think you mentioned you expect negative organic growth in 4Q, but based on what you\u2019re seeing have these businesses bottomed already, or it\u2019s hard to say given the uncertainty in the market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s impossible to say in the uncertainty. I think we have to bear in mind that Mercer and Oliver Wyman are quite different in terms of their client segment. A part of Mercer and Martine can add more, more details to it. A part of Mercer in the career business is project related work, so in that way, similar to Oliver Wyman, which is almost all project related work. But a good chunk of Mercer has recurring revenue in a similar way to RIS and so it\u2019s not quite as exposed to project work and the vagaries of the economic environment as Oliver Wyman is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me, let me hand off the first Martine, and then Scott, to talk a little bit about outlook and project pipeline, but I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019re not highly uncertain environment. And so therefore, it\u2019s impossible to say anything definitively at this stage in terms of trough or where we go from here, but Martine?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martine Ferland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you, Dan. Absolutely. So, as you said, career as for us is the unit that has the most discretionary project. So, we\u2019ve seen a reduced demand there and some of the regular rewards and consulting work, but at the same time, we were able to help clients with their workforce model, their return to work, their reinvention, the transformation. It\u2019s very exposed to the economic conditions though. So, we\u2019re pleased to see that we had a better Q3, than Q2, but we cannot say whether the outcome what it will be because of course, it\u2019s very related to the conditions out there and as we\u2019re seeing lock downs continuing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I pivot to health, for example, we\u2019ve had aspects of our health business and has been super resilient. There\u2019s been lots of demand for digital health, such as our Darwin platform solution voluntary benefit support from a health wellness and mental health issues and delights. But there\u2019s a part of our health business, that\u2019s also related to the head counts at our clients. And therefore, depending on the level of lay off that we say, we see some headwinds in that way. Although so far for 2020, it\u2019s not been too severe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally on the wealth business, there\u2019s a large part of the wealth business that is regulatory work that is recurring. So it can be resilient. We\u2019ve had a little bit less of project work as the markets calmed down in Q3 versus the first half of the year, but the very bright spot is our OCIO business. So our implemented asset business we\u2019ve seen improved capital market performance in Q3, but also very strong net inflows. And we had a very similar pattern during the global financial crisis where when you see volatility, uncertainty on the market, the client wants strong governance, agility and then transaction of assets, and a slight to quality. So, we\u2019re seeing very strong inflows and very strong pipeline building in that business. So, that\u2019s for Mercer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Thank you. Then in the financial crisis, Oliver Wyman decline six quarters in a row, including two quarters at 19%. So, at the end, this has been far more manageable than during the financial crisis, but Scott, you want to talk about your pipeline?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, I\u2019ll try and give you some color, Jimmy. As you know, in the second quarter, we had a pretty severe contraction in revenues, not as bad as the financial crisis, but like most times of stress, it was really driven by our clients focusing on just immediate emergency issues as they dealt with the severity of the pandemic. But throughout, I\u2019d say the back end of Q2 and Q3 we\u2019ve shifted our portfolio to services to help clients manage the crisis. Think about the future, a strategic and operational challenges they\u2019ve faced. And it\u2019s been a really fruitful shift for us and recent sales have been very strong. We think, we\u2019re improving our competitive position and we feel pretty good out there with our clients, but we do need the global economy to get back on track. We need business confidence to remain solid. And if that happens, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t get back to our historical growth rates sometime next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jimmy Bhullar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. And just on your reluctance on share buybacks this year. Not that you buy back a lot, but you have bought back some stock each of the last several years. So, what\u2019s the reason \u2013 and the results have actually been better than expected this year. So, what\u2019s the rationale or reasoning behind not buying back? Is it the macro stocks\u2019 valuation like deals? Any insight into that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Let, me hand over to Mark McGivney. So, Mark?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark McGivney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Hey Jimmy. I actually, the whole cash generation capital management story this year has been a great one for us. Remember back to some of the guidance we gave earlier in the year about capital deployment. We\u2019re largely on track despite the pandemic with those plans. And if you remember coming into the year, the priority for dividend, acquisitions and the big chunk of the leveraging, and as I said, we\u2019re largely on track with all of those. So, we raised our dividend. We\u2019ve got a very active year for M&amp;A, but despite the pandemic, as Dan said earlier, I think it\u2019s actually remarkable as an M&amp;A biggest year in terms of deal value and revenue acquired. So, we\u2019ve been active on the M&amp;A and a front, and we\u2019re still committed to de-leveraging this was going to be a big year of debt paid down. And that\u2019s really what you\u2019re going to see in the fourth quarter. And we may actually see a little bit more M&amp;A activity in the fourth quarter. So coming into the year, we didn\u2019t say share repurchase was going to be that much in the cards and we\u2019re coming in very consistent with the original plans coming into the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that would bring us back into the future to our more balanced approach for capital management, where, as we\u2019ve said to you before, dividends are priority dividend, relative to priority, we\u2019ve put acquisitions ahead of share repurchase and we put share repurchase ahead of building cash on the balance sheet. So, 2021 may be a more normal pattern for us where you see more of a balanced approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jimmy Bhullar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overthinking this, but if you\u2019re expecting full year organic growth to be flat overall, this might imply that the fourth quarter would have to be worse than the third quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, I think what we were giving you our outlook on that top line, we\u2019re basically saying, Oliver Wyman will remain under pressure. The Mercer will have the amount of supplies for the year and probably the quarter. So Mercer is continuing in the category of around low single digit negative growth. And that Marsh and Guy Carpenter will grow in the fourth quarter. In total, the Carpenter would feel more pressure, but RIS as a segment would grow. So, I wouldn\u2019t jump to the conclusion that the top line all that different than what we\u2019ve been operating. What we did point to is that our significant levels of expense reduction that we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter. And sequentially a little bit less expense reduction in the third quarter will be less expense reduction in the fourth quarter. And so our expenses will rise at a faster pace than, than what it has in the rest of the year, but we still expect our expense growth in the fourth quarter to be a negative number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. Understood. One of the things Dan that you mentioned early in the call was strategic hires as an example of recovering expenses. And I was hoping it good talk about that a little bit, if in terms of the context of what, in terms of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in terms of whether that will be something big enough for us to notice from our perspective on the outside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not going to be big enough to notice in our expense base. I mean, you look at it, we\u2019ve got nearly 8,000 people around the world, and if you take a normal year, you\u2019re probably looking at about 10% colleague turnover, which means that 8,000 people that are going to be coming into the organization in any given year. So, even if we have significant levels of strategic hiring, strategic recruitment we would absorb it in our regular expense space. So, you\u2019re not going to see a pop and expenses as a result of that. I mean, in an odd quarter, you might, but over the course of a year, it wouldn\u2019t turn up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess my first question is just trying to connect some of the dots, expenses are down nicely this year. It sounds like you still expect some revenue pressure in 2021. Just, as we\u2019re still dealing with a COVID environment. I would think that would potentially create some expense pressure year-over-year into 2021. And clearly you\u2019ve managed expenses very, very well over the years. So, I guess, how do you deal with that particular year-over-year pressure going on to next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, all first of all, expense growth is a function of revenue growth. We expect our margins to be up in 2021 for the 14th consecutive year. We expect 2021 to be a decent year relative to 2020, because the general economic environment should be better and there should be better health outcomes as well. So, as I mentioned, were learning to live with the virus more. And from that perspective, time is our friend a little bit. So, I\u2019m optimistic. I think we\u2019re all optimistic about 2021, and performance and we\u2019ll control our expense base, revenue within the overall company. We look at RIS is having large amounts of non-recurring revenue, great strategic positioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At some point Consulting will come back strong, whether it\u2019s 2021 or not, it\u2019s too early get out. It\u2019s certainly not going to be early in 2021 that we\u2019ve see a massive bounce back because of the overall environment, but we\u2019re optimistic. I mean, I look at this year, we\u2019ve done better on the top line and bottom line than expected gives us a great foundation. We\u2019re working now to position ourselves for a good 2021 and we\u2019re ready to get to it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then my second question is specific to Marsh. If I look sequentially in first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, what are you seeing in terms of overall retention rates and overall new business generation? Are you seeing improvement of the new business, maybe improving retention rates any color you can offer on that would be helpful?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I\u2019ll hand off to John. John, want to dig in there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Client retention is a very strong, it\u2019s been, been strong throughout the entire year and it\u2019s better than prior year. We had a very strong new business quarter in the first quarter. So, we got off to a very good start to the year, and in the second and third quarter new businesses down slightly year-over-year. But again, given the external environment very, very pleased with the outcome, and it\u2019s not down across the board. So, for example, MMA grew its new business nicely in the third quarter. So, I\u2019m encouraged by how we\u2019re navigating the economic challenges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess specifically though on sequential changes, because I get that year-over-year, it\u2019s going to be, you\u2019re going to face some pressures, but I\u2019m just curious as how it\u2019s developing sequentially?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Doyle</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me, but there \u2013 our quarters aren\u2019t even throughout the course of the year. So, I do think the year-over-year is an important metric. Clearly, where we\u2019ve seen more stress on the new business front is in a couple of areas, right? It\u2019s \u2013 as you I\u2019m sure would expect construction, infrastructure related things, transaction risk rep and warranty type business where the economic slowdown led to left lesser output and less opportunity for us. But again, I think there\u2019s a flight to quality in the more recurring business. We\u2019ve seen a pickup of late.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Glaser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I also think the way to look at it Yaron is, that new business is relative to other companies, very soft. It\u2019s just not as strong as it was last year, given the overall environment, but still the amount of new business that Marsh is winning is significant. I think that\u2019s our\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President CEO of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Glaser</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So thank you for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication as we work through these challenging times. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter.
