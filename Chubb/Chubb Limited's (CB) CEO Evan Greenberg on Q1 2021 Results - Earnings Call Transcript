First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team.</p> <p>And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to Evan.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Evan Greenberg</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Good morning. We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit commercial P&amp;C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading the record ex-cat underwriting results and simply world class margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">It was<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> an active quarter for natural catastrophes due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. Though even with that, we produced a really good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk adjusted underwriting returns.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The public P&amp;C combined ratio was 91.8% and included catastrophe losses of 9.1 percentage points, compared with 3.3% last year. The current accident year combined without cats was 85.2%, compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point improvement was made up of 0.1% loss ratio with the balance related to the expense ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5%. That excludes private equity gains, which most other companies include. On that basis, investment income grew 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In sum, core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion, while net income of $2.3 billion was up significantly over prior year\u2019s $252 million. Phil will have more to say about the expense ratio, cat, prior period development, investment income and book value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to growth and the rate environment, P&amp;C premium were up 9.7% globally, with commercial premiums up 15.6% and consumer lines down 2.5. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on growth of 1.6 points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The consumer lines result included negative growth in global A&amp;H, flat revenue in international personal lines and about 2.5% underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very strong commercial P&amp;C pricing environment globally and based on what we see today, I\u2019m confident these conditions will endure. Chubb was built in all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In North America, commercial P&amp;C premiums grew almost 15%, new business was up 21.7% and renewal retentions remain strong at 95% on a premium basis. In North America, major accounts and specialty business, net premiums written grew about 17.5% or about 15% excluding year-over-year impact of large structured transactions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are trending up about 5.5%. That would varies up or down depending upon line of business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%, general casualty rates were up 34.5% and varied by category of casualty, property rates were up nearly 20% and financial lines rates were up almost 21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our E&amp;S wholesale business, property was up 15.5%, casualty and financial lines rates were up 25%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up 16%, casualty was up 12% excluding comp, with comp up 1% and financial lines rates were up 18.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our international general insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20% on a published basis or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about 17.5% and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Retail commercial growth varied by region with premiums up over 26.5% in Asia-Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the Continent. Our Latin America commercial lines business returned to growth in the quarter with premiums up 4.7%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In overseas gen, rates were up about 14.5%, with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale business. Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we face from negative exposure growth due to reduced business activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the other hand, consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemic\u2019s effects on consumer-related activities. During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Breaking consumer down between A&amp;H and personal lines, our international personal lines business produced modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat constant dollar. While our international A&amp;H business shrank 3.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Travel globally, both business and consumer related remains depressed and that hits A&amp;H hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&amp;H business is beginning to pick up modestly. If we exclude the travel business, our internationally A&amp;H business grew almost 2% on a published basis. We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 2.5% excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California and wildfire exposure related cancellations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb for the service and richness of coverage and are willing to pay for them. These clients segments which are at the heart of what we do grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94%. We achieve positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowners portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To that point, we\u2019re taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $15 million or about 1.25% impact on our growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, in our Asia focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said, the past few quarters are longer. We\u2019re in a harder firming market for commercial P&amp;C in most of the world. The rate environment and my judgment is a rational and necessary response to years of industry under pricing and a more uncertain risk environment today, driven by climate change, litigation, environment and cyber related exposures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting knowhow, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus, though we\u2019re never perfect. Some lines are there. Others have a way to go. Virtually all of our commercial P&amp;C lines of business continued to achieve rates that exceed loss cost and so margin continued to improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see, we\u2019re off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our organization is focused, it\u2019s mission driven, the quality of Chubb service and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the wellhead of our reputation. We are leaning in to the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused, and we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably, while increasing shareholder value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In light of recent events concerning the Hartford and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want to reiterate once again, our enduring views concerning M&amp;A and capital management. We look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and product areas, and we pull the trigger infrequently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have lots of optionality. We have made 17 acquisitions over the past 15 years and have an excellent track record of advancing the company\u2019s capabilities, while creating shareholder value. Our approach is steady and consistent. We are extremely patient, disciplined and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building organically and is good for shareholders, we won\u2019t hesitate to pull the trigger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As regards surplus capital, we\u2019re again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both organic and non-organic. Beyond that, we return surplus capital to shareholders. We are highly confident about our future and wealth creating -- creation prospects and we approached the Hartford from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create additional value and would not distract us from capitalizing on an organic growth opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that said, the purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our company\u2019s business. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Phil and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Phil Bancroft</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Evan. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong. Our balance sheet includes a $121 billion AA rated portfolio of cash and investment assets. We have over $74 billion in capital, stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $519 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. Well, there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income. We expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, for the quarter. Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continued to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses. Instead of net investment income, as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Book and tangible book value per shares decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after-tax in our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion after-tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities, and in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. At March 31st, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gains position of $2.8 billion after-tax.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our pretax P&amp;C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from severe weather related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in the U.S. We had favorable prior period developments in the quarter of $192 million pretax or $156 million after-tax. The favorable development is with approximately 20% in long tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 80% in short tail lines. There was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&amp;C COVID-19 losses, the majority of which remain as incurred but not reported.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion and are paid to incurred ratio was 77%. The P&amp;C administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter improved by 70 basis points over the prior year, about half related to one-time items that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Karen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Karen Beyer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Phil. At this time, we are happy to take your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Phillips</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the nice quarter and Evan appreciate it the time here. I guess I want to focus first on you sound still very bullish on commercial lines and exposure growth you want to push for. You said, last quarter commercial lines will lag this quarter, you\u2019re confident that conditions will continue on? I guess, with your numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there still quite a bit of a gap there, that\u2019s good, a little bit narrower than what you said prior. But I guess two-part question is, how adequate are current rates across the Board? It\u2019s hard to imagine they\u2019re not? And then, I guess, you didn\u2019t say you want to push for exposure growth still, so is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing gap and the rate versus loss trend?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s funny how people think about rate right now. And this obsession with our rate increases decelerating the rate of increase decelerating, accelerating, where is it and nothing is [ph] trying to achieve. You\u2019re trying to achieve a risk adjusted return, which translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk adjusted return. So let\u2019s call that, 15% or it depends on the line of business, let\u2019s call it 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as you approach that, as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at least loss cost. We\u2019re achieving. We have more and more of our portfolio and its proprietary, so I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper risk adjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident your basis. We measure both. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase. And look at the margin between the rate and exposure and loss cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now with that, let me go a step further for you, because of this obsession about this. When I look at the third quarter and fourth quarter last year, and I measure the first quarter against it right now, and I\u2019m taking the time on this question, because I know all of your colleagues or most of them have this question on their mind. When I look at the level of rate increase this quarter measured against prior, okay?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Property in North America in aggregate got rate increases in the mid-teens, which is about 2 point to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third quarter and fourth quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on, rate. When I look at primary casualty, the rates are up. They\u2019re higher than they were on the average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat, with the average of the quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When I look at marine, it\u2019s up. When I look at aviation, it\u2019s flat to down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When I do this internationally kind of the same trend, property down 2 points to 3 points, the rate of increase from what it was the other two quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and umbrella the rate of increase is flat. Financial line is up. And marine is down. So, no, sorry, marine is up and aviation is down a little bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to answer that question that from every angle I can that I know is on everyone\u2019s mind. You know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Phillips</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. No. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Conditions are excellent. So that lead to this ones, frankly, marine question I didn\u2019t ask, Evan, but I am curious to hear what you can say. Not even asking about [inaudible], specifically at all. But just in general, clearly, there was some capital to be deployed there. And as you said, not burning a hole in your pocket, you\u2019re very infrequently posed for entries only. If something like that is off the table and then growth in the conditions are still pretty right. I guess how should we think about where to go from here for maybe another capital deployment round of authorization versus more organic or just kind of what can we expect for what was possibly can be used there and how it might be used in the near-term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, you can imagine Michael is steady as she goes. We have clear minds and we are at rest. We adopt our buybacks from a $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, and we will actively resume that. We had to take a pause during the -- this episode with Hartford and beyond that steady as she goes. We got capital for risk and opportunity and we are patient people.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Phillips</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate. Congrats.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Greg Peters with Raymond James.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. I don\u2019t want this to count as a question, but I believe, Phil, this is going to be your last earnings call, if I\u2019m correct. Well, congratulations on your retirement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. With by the way number 78.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">He is going over the wall, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Number 78. Yeah. Not to use. Yeah. I knew you guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I knew I\u2019d be -- I knew that would be an issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And remember I\u2019m not here with me, it\u2019s like dog here. Oh, I would say\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know how old you look.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the rumors about working for you are epic. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been good time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. I don\u2019t know what\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Like a just rumors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, one of the areas that you spent time in previous calls talking about is the expense ratio, because it has -- it showed improvement last year, because of in part, some COVID related teeny savings and things like that. And then, it\u2019s still seems like it\u2019s on a general pathway of improvement. So I was wondering, perhaps, if you can give us an updated view. When we look at these other companies that we follow, most of them try and map out of between a 40-basis-point to 70-basis-point operational improvement in your expense ratio year in and year out? I\u2019m wondering if you can just give us an update a view on your expense ratio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Most of them are bloated. Look at our expense ratio in absolute terms versus others our operating expense ratio. And North America is in the single digits and continuing to head marginally lower and it will through efficiencies, which I have talked about numerous times that with technology and in all forms, so I won\u2019t go into it in great detail, but analytics, robotics, straight through processing, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are on track to continue to drive efficiencies in the operations. And the same in overseas, general the difference there is, you\u2019re across 50 some odd countries. And so by its nature, you have a different expense structure and it continues to improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re growing our commercial -- our P&amp;C business, the commercial businesses at a rate far in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses of marginally. So we\u2019re leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up. But you\u2019re also got the added benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also,</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It runs a lower acquisition cost then does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher loss ratio. That\u2019s just axiomatic and true, but that business will continue to operate in the range that it\u2019s in that you see right now, up or down a couple of tenths of a percent in my mind as we look forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have that higher acquisition cost, the operating expense, so the internal expense ratio will go down, because you will have more volume returning against it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line, it will become a greater mix of our total and so that\u2019ll go the other way. It\u2019s just natural. And -- but that business then runs a lower loss ratio, the margins are excellent as you know. So maybe that gives you the color you\u2019re looking for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Indeed. Thanks. And my follow-up question, boy, so many different areas I could go on. But I\u2019m going to focus on operations. You said in your prepared remarks, that loss cost trend is running around just about 5 points across the book. And then during your comments and then your response to the previous question, you talked about really some --really robust rate, actions being taken across certain lines of business like general casualty, financial lines, things like that? Should I think about the loss cost trend in those lines is running higher, because of the rate you\u2019re able to achieve or is that just an industry loss cost trend that you\u2019re able to get the rate you\u2019re getting?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s see if I answer it this way for you. The marketplace in terms of rate is striving -- the marketplace, because you operate within the marketplace, is striving for two things. And that is you have those who have a hole to fill, because they have deficiency in lines of business. Remember, the industry operates like a giant retro. And then they also need rate for adequacy today. That\u2019s the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you have operated at adequacy along the way, you don\u2019t have that first part that hold the film and achieving market rate, you\u2019re achieving better than adequate and not benefits. You will see we\u2019re in a -- we\u2019re certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the transient impact of COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we\u2019ll see how it all plays in terms of a margin. We play things conservatively. But we are receiving rate that ensures the portfolio will achieve adequacy in terms of risk adjusted rate of return across the book and if we have more than that, well, that\u2019ll just speak for itself over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks for the answers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s the best I can give you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Evan I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the loss cost trend in North America commercial. It sounds like that ticked up a bit to 5.5%. Sounds like it\u2019s been ticking up, I guess, it is obviously a minor detail, given the amount of rate that you\u2019re getting and continuing to earn in above trend. But wondering if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s driving that increase? I know there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces and mix and everything else, but just sort of wondering if maybe you can just elaborate on what was driving the increase in the loss trend?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. And my god, you\u2019re looking at about 0.5 point change. So, let\u2019s just keep it in perspective. You have a couple of things. So in the short tail lines, you have non-modeled cat loss that is on an accelerated trend. Everyone sees it. You know that. I\u2019ll stop -- I\u2019ll move on from there, but that finds its way into your -- if you\u2019re prudent in your expected loss cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Secondly, on the casualty side, given the litigation environment and across different lines of business, we have watched and have talked about it endlessly. That it is the loss cost environment there is not benign and so as we always relentlessly study our trends across each class, we reflected over a period of time in how we view loss cost and we react very quickly, particularly if there\u2019s any bad news, we react very slowly to goodness. And so it\u2019s -- those two that are conspire between short and long tail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Was there anything in the quarter or, I guess, some of the courts started to reopen? Was there anything specifically on the litigation environment that you saw during the quarter or it\u2019s just more reflection?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. David, no news in a quarter. We just do study that we look at -- we\u2019re looking at years past and trending forward. When you think about these things, they don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t react, the loss cost trends aren\u2019t based upon news of this or that in any given quarter. They\u2019re based on a more stable period of time and a much bigger data set obviously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to switch gears a little bit to the international life business. Another good quarter strong sales there, up 14% constant currency. I was hoping maybe you could dive into the different regions between Asia and LatAm and what\u2019s driving success there in each region? And maybe just stepping back a bit and just talk about the opportunity here and if you think M&amp;A is the lever that that you\u2019re evaluating to maybe increase scale in any of these markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, great question. The business is overwhelmingly Asia. Latin America, think predominantly, Chile, and Banco de Chile and our partnership with them. And Chile is a great market, but Chile has truly been suffering from COVID and the lockdown. And while it\u2019s a very good business, it has some headwind in terms of growth related to that, but it\u2019s coming back and that\u2019ll continue to do very well, spent distribution, both branch and direct marketing related. It\u2019s more credit related type products and short-term than it is long-term product. Though there is a mix of that in the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly right now and in this quarter, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan doing well and our business in Korea getting better, but it\u2019s small. And I don\u2019t know it\u2019ll take a while to cast shadow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What\u2019s not consolidated in those numbers, but we -- that we add as a line item, because we don\u2019t have over 50% yet, is the increase in Guantai [ph], which is doing well. And by the way, we are on our path and it\u2019s a very sensitive moment. So I don\u2019t want to talk about it much. But that will consolidate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll finish what we got to get done to -- be able to consolidate Guantai and that life business is growing well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the organic growth and those are agency-based businesses for the most part, with some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan. But if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China and those are predominantly -- those are agency businesses, where agency force is growing. These are long-term products. Guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there\u2019s a healthy mix of savings and protection products. And that business is, we built it from dust predominantly and it\u2019s cast and a shadow. It\u2019s a few billion dollars now and I see great growth potential for that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As regards M&amp;A, I made the statement. When I came to the end of my commentary, I said, we have lots of optionality. We have optionality, when we\u2019re looking at opportunity. What that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments and that includes the life insurance business. And if we found the right thing and it was accretive to our strategy. That was good for shareholders. We wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a minute. Thanks for the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is tying together some of the comments we\u2019ve heard throughout the call, just in terms of market conditions, Evan still seems pretty positive there? And then, as we think about the rest of this year, right, we\u2019ll have, the economy continues to improve, so exposure growth should pick up. So, as we think about your commercial businesses, both within the U.S. and internationally, given the dynamics of maybe some stabilization to slight deceleration in pricing, but\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What is the question Elyse?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess the question is and trying to understand, should we think about pre -- as we think about premium growth within commercial? Should we think about that being stable relative to the Q1, and perhaps, even improving as we get the economic improvement on picking up from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t -- there\u2019s nothing on the horizon that I see that I -- that tells me we\u2019re going to really decelerate in the commercial area. It varies by businesses as we look at it. But we\u2019re feeling very good about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then my second question. Evan, as I was reading your annual letter, you may have mentioned of social inflation, throughout the call, we\u2019ve kind of brought it off in terms of just what we\u2019re seeing today. But there\u2019s obviously the issues that the industry is dealing with it goes back many, many decades and I was just hoping to kind of get your update as you kind of elaborate on some of the what you mentioned in your annual report, as you guys think about some of the kind of the looming issues that the industry, yourselves and others are dealing with today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s not a new issue to us. We\u2019ve been on top of it for a while, the reviver statutes. They produce lots of notices. They then start to ripen and you get fax. And you are match -- you\u2019re able to match them up against coverages that were in force at a period of time and as they do, we recognize any life of we have been and continue to recognize liabilities that we have against those and that is all baked into our published loss ratios that you see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The reviver statutes have been open for a period of time and so in most all jurisdictions, the reported notices of circumstances have decelerated tremendously from when they first opened up. There are some states that are continuing to consider opening up reviver statutes and there\u2019s, and so this is an event that the industry deals with over time, these things evolve over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I might add, we\u2019re very sympathetic to those and it breaks your heart where you see the circumstances of children abused by adults sexually and were there for real. Then on the other side of the coin, the trial bar is a money making machine and there is -- that combined with new technologies of social media and litigation funding, they see it as another dog bowl they eat out of. And there is also a lot of suspect and specious behavior that is involved here. And our job is to tease out what\u2019s real and defend against anything that that we suspect is just for we\u2019ll got gain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color, Evan, and I also just want to extend my congrats to Phil on his upcoming retirement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Elyse was out also because he went over the wall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Phil Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Elyse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Elyse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, everybody. So I\u2019m a bit obsessive in my nature. So I hope you can indulge another question on rates. Okay. I just\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At least not asking me to be redundant, you\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t ask me to do that. You will be\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will try.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026question though. Absolutely. With some odd there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will try. So your sub-market condition center. I think that we are seeing more lines achieving rate adequacy, as you pointed out. We\u2019re in third year of rate increases in excess of trends, interest rates have increased. So why wouldn\u2019t Chubb specifically or the industry more broadly be willing to give up more rate for volume as we look at the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at this point? Look at combined ratios of most, look at the loss environment. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I think, the industry overall is not in a place where it has achieved adequate risk adjusted when you consider both things I talked about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by the way, we are driving. I can\u2019t speak about the industry. But I\u2019ll tell you what Chubb is grow -- just look at it. Chubb is growing exposure. We\u2019re achieving rate and we are growing a lot of business. Because it\u2019s at prices that we think are adequate to produce an adequate risk adjusted return. Our new business was up over 20%. Well, and our renewal retentions are high. We\u2019re growing. We\u2019re growing market share, because the pricing is right. You\u2019re in on risk business. Pricing is an adequacy is where you start. That\u2019s as good as I can give you Yaron. Beyond that you\u2019re over thinking it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. That\u2019s very helpful. And clearly you guys are growing off a really large base to begin with. So, yeah, no, no, no other questions on that. I guess switching gears a little bit. We\u2019ve heard some talk about potential tax reform. I realize these are very early days here. But can you maybe share your views on corporate tax reform? It\u2019s potential impact on Chubb and Chubb positioning?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I -- You know what I -- I don\u2019t know enough. And we have both the corporate tax rate that that could go up. They are talking 21 going to 25 or 28. We\u2019ll see how that plays. And then, secondly, you\u2019ve got guilty and beat. And then you\u2019ve got the notion of a minimum global tax rate multilateral agreement with OECD. All of these plates are spinning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The green book is not yet out. That would tell us any detail of what\u2019s in the tax reform for -- the tax increase, heck, it\u2019s not a reform, proposal. And so we don\u2019t even know what the administration is yet proposing other than in headlines and so we really can\u2019t speculate at this point. We just don\u2019t know. When it comes out, we\u2019ll have a better sense and then it\u2019s got to run the gauntlet in Congress and we\u2019ll see from there. I can\u2019t speculate at this point, Yaron.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fair enough. I appreciate the thoughts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks. A couple of them here quickly for you, Evan. The first one, if I look at the rate activity that you\u2019ve been generating the last several quarters in North America commercial and then 5.5 % loss cost inflation. Now you do the math and you get a lot more on the line loss ratio improvement in your booking right now. Is that because of your just conservatism with respect to your potential social inflation trends or is there something else that we\u2019re just not thinking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brian, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking about. I don\u2019t know what you guys are thinking about. But I -- we have always operated the company conservatively and I\u2019m not going to -- I\u2019m going to stop right there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then the second question, just curious if I look at\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will say this to you, let\u2019s say, we produced over 2 points of margin improvement. It was an accident year combined ratio of 85.2%, My God, world class.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No doubt. I completely agree. The second one just sticking with North American commercial, written premium -- net written premium growth really attractive in the quarter, gross written premium growth also kind of increased, but clearly, you\u2019re seeing some benefits from just lower seated premium, any change in kind of the reinsurance strategy, as we head into 2021?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, not a change of strategy. Not a change of strategy there. We have -- it varies by line of business. There\u2019s mixed within there. And then there is also within some lines of business, we have increased our net appetite.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got you. Make sense. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one more here, we have better spread of risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Thanks. Good morning. My question was just on -- a similar way, which from the statement that you guys put out last week. There\u2019s something for some clarification. There\u2019s a comment, you said, and this is involving the Hartford past, your transaction would have been engagement coming from the Hartford on the terms of our last proposal. I guess my question is, is that just a general comment about your desire to do friendly M&amp;A or are you trying to say something about that being your last proposal?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, the chapter with the Hartford is closed. We have moved along. And beyond that, Ryan, I\u2019m not going to now engage and talk about past events.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. That\u2019s right. And then, in terms of like, thinking about M&amp;A now, I guess, it\u2019s been five years since Chubb, back then, I think, the big gating item was you didn\u2019t want to dilute tangible book value per share. I\u2019m just trying to understand as you think about M&amp;A targets, has any of your thinking evolved in terms of, what\u2019s most important financially, the earnings accretion is it still, mainly, or accretion at least into tangible book value per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all, Ryan, with all the respect, your comment about tangible book is a nonsense comment. It was dilutive to begin with to tangible and then it\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 forward [ph] it\u2019s way, way out of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Almost 29%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I don\u2019t know what, how you\u2019re thinking about it, it\u2019s hard to do M&amp;A that isn\u2019t dilutive to tangible and then the question is, is -- in the first moment and then the question is, is how creative is it and how quickly do you return. So, with all due respect, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re thinking clearly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Number two, let me make one --I\u2019m not going to go into Chubb\u2019s metrics of what\u2019s most important, that\u2019s not important here, and by the way, every deal has its own signature. And so you want it to fit on a bumper sticker and it doesn\u2019t work that way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I\u2019m going to make one comment about M&amp;A today. EPS accretion, when you use a lot of cash, this immediate lift, that\u2019s really easy. And I don\u2019t miss that one, whatsoever. None of us do. So that\u2019s the easiest metric. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about when you measure wealth creation value. Thank you very much for the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take our last question from Meyer Shields, KBW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Two really quick ones I think. One, Evan, should we infer anything significant about reinsurance pricing from the fact that those written premiums were down year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Second question. I was hoping you could comment on non-travel accident health pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On accident health pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. With non-travel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-travel. Yeah. It\u2019s a -- Meyer, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- remember we don\u2019t do a lot of health insurance, it\u2019s supplemental health and accident business. So, it\u2019s fundamentally stable and actually up a few points. Rates have been moving up particularly in the corporate travel area, the commercial business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in our direct marketing\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 business, it\u2019s very steady.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And at this time, there are no further questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Karen Beyer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, everyone, for your time and attention this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This does conclude today\u2019s conference.
