First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> of our management team.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Evan Greenberg</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. As I mentioned on our last call, I\u2019m coming to you this quarter from Singapore, our regional headquarters for Asia Pacific. The outlook in Asia for growth across our businesses - commercial P&amp;C, as well as consumer, non-life and life, both short and long term is significant. The region is simply energizing. We have a large organization of talented executives and a strong, diverse capability focused on the execution of a broad set of strategies throughout the region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you saw in our press release, we had a simply outstanding quarter; in fact, another record quarter performance with double-digit premium revenue and earnings growth as a result of world-class P&amp;C underwriting results that produced an 85.4 combined ratio, record net investment income and a doubling of our life earnings. Our premium revenue growth was so well spread and broad-based, driven by outstanding double-digit growth in our commercial and consumer P&amp;C businesses in both North America and internationally, and over 100% growth in our life business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.8 with a return on tangible equity of 21%. Core operating income topped $2 billion, up 14% or 16.5% on a per-share basis. Both were record results. For the first six months, we produced operating earnings of $3.9 billion or $9.32 per share, up 13% and 15.8% respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our underwriting performance resulted from a combination of strong premium growth, excellent current accident year margins with a combined ratio of 83.3, and favorable prior period reserve development particularly in North America. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the investment side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up $290 million or 31% over prior year. Our portfolio yield is now 4% versus 3.2% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.8%. Our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates and compound income without changing our risk profile, and then life earnings doubled to $254 million, driven by our business in Asia, which is overwhelmingly supplemental A&amp;H. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and ROE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to more color around growth, pricing and the rate environment, consolidated net written premiums for the company increased 16.1% in the quarter on a published basis, or 16.8% in constant dollars, made up of 10.5% growth in our P&amp;C business globally and almost 130% in life premiums. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Global P&amp;C premium growth in the quarter was very well balanced and broad-based; in fact, our strongest quarter for growth since the third quarter of \u201921. North America, Asia-Pac and Europe all produced double-digit growth. It\u2019s worth noting since 2019, we\u2019ve grown our commercial P&amp;C business by 50%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the commercial P&amp;C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines were strong in the quarter in both North America and internationally, while financial lines globally continued to soften. We have been diligent about staying on top of loss costs and our positive prior year reserve development reflects a steady conservative approach to reserving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beginning with North America, commercial premiums excluding ag were up 10.5%. P&amp;C growth was 14% excluding financial lines, while financial lines premiums decreased, reflecting the disciplined response to the underwriting environment. Total premium in our E&amp;S business, the Westchester, grew 12%, while our major accounts division grew 14%, or 11% excluding loss portfolio transfers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our middle market division, premiums were up 5% with P&amp;C growth of 9%. Our middle market workers comp book was flat and financial lines premiums in middle market declined about 1.5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall pricing for total North America commercial lines increased 12.8%, including rate of 8.7% and exposure change of 3.8%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty excluding financial lines was up 17.7%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are trending loss cost in North America at 6.7 and it varies by line. In general, we are trending loss cost in short tail classes at 5.8. In long tail, excluding comp loss costs are trending at 7.3 and our first dollar workers comp book is trending at 4.7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me provide a bit more color around rate and growth. Property pricing was up 31.5% with rates up 22% and exposure change of 7.8%. Major accounts and E&amp;S property together grew premiums over 40% in the quarter, while middle market property grew 11.4%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.3% with rates up almost 9% and exposure up 2.2%. We grew casualty in the quarter 8%. In workers comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up just over 5% with rates up 5% and exposure up 4%. Primary workers comp premiums declined 2.9% in the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For financial lines, the competitive environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&amp;O, and rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North American financial lines in aggregate were down about 4.5%. Our fin lines book shrank 3.7%. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was very strong at 98.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another strong quarter with premiums up almost 11%. Our growth was balanced across a broad range of geographies and our retention was very strong at 104% on a premium basis and over 90% on an account basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 14.7% while the homeowners loss cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. There is a lot of attention placed on consumer auto experience, so I thought I would comment briefly on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For us, auto is a small part of our high net worth business, and you may have noticed that we had a modest reserve release in our prior year\u2019s reserves for our North America personal lines segment in the quarter. This release was primarily in auto, and we are comfortable with our reserves and loss PICs for auto.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our international general insurance operations, net premiums were up 11% in constant dollars, or 9.3% after FX. Our international commercial business grew 12%. Consumer was up 9.5%. Our international retail business grew over 10.5% while our London wholesale business grew about 14%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our international retail business, growth was led by Asia Pacific with premiums up 17.5%, made up of commercial lines growth of over 12% and consumer P&amp;C up more than 23%. Europe produced overall growth of 10.5% with the continent up more than 12%. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across international commercial portfolios. Our retail business pricing was up 8.9% with rates up 5% and exposure change of 3.7%, while loss costs across our international commercial portfolio are trending at 6.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our international A&amp;H division had another strong quarter with premiums up over 16%. In Asia, our A&amp;H business grew 31% driven by our direct marketing and travel insurance business and the consolidation of Cigna Thailand. In the U.K. and Europe, A&amp;H premiums were up 11.5%. In our international life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums tripled to over a billion dollars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Since I\u2019m here, I want to conclude with a bit more about operations in Asia, which have very strong growth and momentum across our businesses, both consumer non-life and life, and commercial P&amp;C. We have significant opportunity for growth, both short and long term, in a broad variety of markets across a broad range of customers and distribution channels. Our total premium in the region is about $9 billion and well balanced with half non-life split 50/50 consumer and commercial, and the other half life. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our overall presence and capabilities in north, Southeast Asia and Australia are spread across 11 markets with distinct and significant areas of growth opportunity in each. Across the region, we have a broad range of product capabilities focused on different customer segments with varied and meaningful distribution strength, including the diverse and growing list of partnerships with financial institutions and e-commerce leaders that give us access to hundreds of millions of consumers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have strong digital capabilities and a fast-growing digital insurance business encompassing more of our products. We are the largest direct marketers of insurance, mostly A&amp;H products to consumers in Asia through both non-life and life companies that are unifying to offer more products to more customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a macro perspective, the region is so dynamic and vast with a diversity of cultures and large economies, some with large young populations, some with large aging populations that have a different set of needs. Broadly speaking in Asia, there is an innovation-oriented mindset, a strong work ethic and a deep dynamism. Supply chains and capital flows are growing deeper across the region. There is growing infrastructure investment. As a result, regional commerce and trade is growing and becoming more connected between Southeast Asia, North Asia, India and Australia. There is a lot to be optimistic about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Summary - we are having an outstanding year with record quarterly and first half financial results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way and underwriting conditions are favorable in a lot of areas of our business. We have a lot of momentum heading into the second half, and as I look ahead, we again are confident in our ability to continue this pattern of growth in revenue and earnings and in turn drive double-digit EPS growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Peter and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Enns</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Evan, and good morning. As you\u2019ve just heard, Chubb delivered another quarter of strong underwriting and investment performance, leading to record results which generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow this quarter and $4.8 billion through the first half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $724 million in share repurchases at an average price of $197.04 per share, and $354 million in dividends. Book value and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.2% and 3.1% respectively for the quarter and 4.3% and 6.5% respectively through the first half of the year, reflecting record core operating income net of the capital returned to shareholders noted earlier. In addition to the quarterly ROEs Evan just gave you, our year-to-date core operating ROE and return on tangible equity of 3.2% and 20.2% respectively exceed the target range Evan has laid out in the past. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted net investment income from the quarter was $1.24 billion or $20 million above the top end of our guidance, primarily from higher private equity income. The increase over last year of 30% was driven by strong cash flow, our accelerated portfolio turnover, and higher reinvestment rates. In the third quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to rise from $1.24 billion this quarter to around $1.27 billion on a recurring basis, and to continue to grow from there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to our invested assets, we continue to tactically execute our portfolio turnover strategy while maintaining a conservative credit posture. During the quarter, we reclassified our $8 billion held-to-maturity portfolio to available for sale, to have even more flexibility to put money to work at higher yields. These securities had $397 million after tax of net unrealized losses that reduced book value at the time of the change. It\u2019s important to note that the transfer itself has no economic impact as the underlying securities remained unchanged and are of a very high quality, with an average rating of AA. We will look to sell parts of this portfolio only where and when we think it makes economic sense, and not all of the unrealized loss will become realized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our underwriting business, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $400 million principally from weather-related events in the U.S. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $260 million pre-tax, which was split about evenly between short tail and long tail lines and included $146 million for North American commercial and $61 million for overseas general. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $60 million principally related to molestation claim development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I noted, the PPD and overseas general for the quarter was $61 million versus $173 million last year. The larger favorable PPD in the quarter last year was concentrated in the 2020 accident year and included favorable development from COVID-related economic shutdowns. The year-to-date favorable PPD for overseas general was $204 million, comparable to last year\u2019s $233 million and $181 million in 2021, all in short tail lines for these years. Our paid to incurred ratio for the quarter was 89% or 83% after adjusting for cats and PPD. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our life segment, year-over-year segment income growth came primarily from the acquisition of Cigna. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our core operating effective income tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is at the top end of our guided range of 18% to 19%. We now expect our annual operating effective tax rate for 2023 to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%, excluding the impact of consolidating Huatai. On July 1, we completed the acquisition of additional shares of Huatai Group, increasing our aggregate ownership to 69.6%. We expect the closing of additional shares this quarter, which will bring our ownership up to 83.2%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beginning in Q3, we will consolidate Huatai\u2019s results within our financials. We currently estimate consolidation will result in a small amount of accretion to operating income and EPS, book value and ROE, and a modest amount of dilution to tangible book value which we estimate will recover within the next few quarters. However, I would note we are still working through our purchase accounting analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Karen Beyer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your first question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, great. Good morning. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess first question would be on the--thanks for the commentary on loss trend in the commercial side. It sounded like it stayed flattish and yet the rate environment accelerated sequentially. I\u2019m just curious, any context on why the rate environment is accelerating if loss costs are kind of staying steady - I know that\u2019s just for you, and does your loss cost, also PIC include higher reinsurance costs, if you\u2019re experiencing higher reinsurance costs? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well you know, the rate, it\u2019s all baked into it, of course; but the rate environment accelerated in property, and I think that speaks for itself, as you know, where it\u2019s about the loss environment particularly around cat and inflation costs and property generally, and reinsurance costs have moved up in property, and I think that\u2019s a--you know, in total that\u2019s a very rational response. In casualty, loss cost trends have been moving higher and I think it\u2019s reflective of the trend we\u2019ve been observing over the last number of years. It\u2019s not a new story, it\u2019s a story we\u2019re aware of and on top of, but I think it\u2019s rational.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, you see comp and professional lines, I talked about going the other way, so I think the market frankly and the reacceleration is a rational response to the external environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Zaremski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. My one follow-up is on--you touched on catastrophe losses. They actually looked a bit lighter than at least what the consensus models for kind of a normal 2Q for Chubb, whereas some other competitors, maybe more regional based, have experienced much, much higher than, quote-unquote, normal catastrophe levels. Any commentary on your cat load this quarter, was it just--was it kind of in line with expectations?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, cat losses are never in line with--particularly with expectations. They\u2019re either greater or less than you might imagine in any quarter on the average annual loss PIC you would choose for that. This was a very heavy cat quarter for the industry, and I think most companies have reported significantly higher cat losses than average. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any particular magic as to why Chubb\u2019s was lower. We underwrite well, we have a good spread of business, we select risk well; but that doesn\u2019t mean we choose where a--it translates to we choose where a tornado is going to land and come down. If it had moved 10 miles to the east or west, we could have had greater losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a variation. It has variability quarter on quarter, and we had a very good experience this quarter. Thanks for the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Good morning everybody. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess my first question, just looking at North America, commercial\u2019s underlying loss ratio, the improvement there, is there a mix component there? Is it mostly rate over trend? Could you maybe elaborate on that a bit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The current accident year loss ratio, it reflects the totality of the commercial business, so it\u2019s a mix of all the lines, right? Property and casualty rate and price exceed loss cost, and that is potentially a positive to the ultimate loss ratio margin. In the case of comp and financial lines, rate and price lag the selected trends, and in that case the ultimate margin is potentially shrinking or it\u2019s neutral. Our loss PIC reflects all of that, and we\u2019re patient and we lean towards conservatism in our loss PICs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Then my second question, just with regards to rate adequacy particularly in financial lines and property, just because of the very different directions we\u2019re seeing rates moving in those lines, are the rates adequate in both of those today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think for the business we\u2019ve written, yes, the rates are adequate for our portfolio, and our loss PICs reflect that. The kind of combined ratio we\u2019re putting up has a mix of all of that in there and it speaks for itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Yaron Kinar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks so much, and good luck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Does that make sense to you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think it might be close to, what, 8:30 pm your time, Evan, so I\u2019m going to say good evening to you and your management team. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. It is - it\u2019s about 8:30. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s almost bedtime, right? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For my first question, in your prepared comments, you spoke about innovation and specifically in Asia, and there\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric in the marketplace--you know, it\u2019s been ongoing, but it seems to have accelerated this year around artificial intelligence, large language models, generative AI, and we obviously closely monitor your expense ratio, so maybe you could spend a minute and talk about your perspectives on these very important technology developments and how you think about it for your company, not only in North America but on a global basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and thanks for that question. We\u2019ve been employing AI for quite a number of years now - five or six years, anyway, and particularly it\u2019s algorithmic AI, not generalized or large language models. It\u2019s employed in the operations side of the business, to a degree in the underwriting and claims side and the marketing side, chatbots, etc. There have been a lot of experiments and use cases that prove themselves out, and we\u2019re now in a stage where we\u2019re scaling and will over the next two or three years to receive what we think are significant benefits out of that, insightfulness and abilities in underwriting and in claims in discrete areas in the service side of our business where we see cost and lower level work that can come out or improve in its accuracy. All of that is things we know and we\u2019re scaling the tools.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the same time, as you can imagine, we are on the large language models and the potential benefit that that will ultimately bring beyond algorithmic, particularly in underwriting and claims and the ability to work--either replace work that is done or make it more accurate, or work alongside underwriters. It\u2019s not a silver bullet, and we\u2019re doing this on a global basis, some regions more in marketing, some more focused on portfolio underwriting. But yet, whatever anyone is doing spreads to the other, and it\u2019s just where we start on one and end with another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The generalized and large language is going to be iterative, it will be over time. If you think about insurance and the parameterization risk or factor around what we do, how many lines of business, the exposures, the geographies you cross, and so by its nature it\u2019s going to be iterative and take longer than some of the breathless rhetoric that I hear, but we\u2019re focused on that as part of what a modern insurance company is going to look like and is looking like.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I feel like we could probably have a long conversation on that topic.

Go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t know if I can make it there tomorrow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Reinsurance - you know, you look at what\u2019s going on in the market, and I know you\u2019re very close to it, it seems like especially in property cat, it seems like these conditions, some of the hardest market conditions we\u2019ve experienced in 20-plus years, and yet if I look at your global reinsurance business and look at the growth, it seems like you\u2019re not really growing your exposures, you\u2019re just growing your rate. Maybe you could provide some perspective on how you\u2019re looking at the reinsurance business in the context--and maybe your perspective is the rate\u2019s still inadequate, but give your perspectives on the reinsurance market. That\u2019d be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, look - I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said, but you\u2019ll notice at the same time, our property insurance business is growing, like, 40% right now, and that\u2019s a combination of rate and exposure, and some of that exposure is not premium, by the way, it\u2019s structural changes and it\u2019s unit count. It\u2019s a lot of exposure growing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In property cat, that\u2019s growing more exposure as we grow that, and it\u2019s growing it in the tail. When we look at the risk-reward--and by the way, the property insurance as we grow it across geographies is also growing exposure in the tail. We prefer to put our emphasis on the property insurance business, and the spread of risk we\u2019re getting, we\u2019ve never seen better pricing and better risk-adjusted returns than we see right now in large account, E&amp;S, middle market, in a variety of geographies across the globe. We\u2019re putting more emphasis on that than we are on property cat. We don\u2019t think the risk-adjusted returns are as favorable - plain and simple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the answers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You got it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Morning David. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning Evan, or good evening for you, Evan. Just wanted to ask, I guess sort of related to the last question, just about premium growth in North America commercial and the difference between the 14% growth excluding financial lines, and I think you said it was about 18% increase in price excluding financial lines. Maybe you could just talk about the drivers of that disconnect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. You know, there has been a lot of chatter I\u2019ve noticed about that in the last number of months. It\u2019s actually pretty straightforward - the majority of the difference between the two numbers is a result of structural changes. Included in our price is the impact of things like deductible changes and attachment points, where we can put a value on it, and so it acts like rate or it acts like exposure. It doesn\u2019t add to premium necessarily, that portion of it, but it adds to potential margin, or another way of saying it, it supports loss cost. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The point of talking about rate and exposure that way, rather than by the way putting exposure over into loss ratio and saying, here\u2019s the loss ratio trend, which is different than loss cost trend, is to give a sense about that, and so here is the price we get, rate plus the trend, and yet a portion of the rate, depends on line of business, or of the exposure is actually not premium. As I said, it acts like premium but it\u2019s not premium. That\u2019s the difference between the two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Did I say that clearly for you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, yes. That makes sense. I guess maybe just a quick follow-up on that, any way to size terms and condition changes versus, I guess, the premium increase change, or if I were to look at the rate increase?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s in rate or it\u2019s in exposure. We look at it, but we don\u2019t go that far and start disclosing that. What you\u2019ve got to know is look at our overall premium growth, our retention rates that we give you - it\u2019s very healthy, and then what you can see is, wow, this is the amount of rate and price that goes against loss cost, so you can get a transparency around that. You don\u2019t add the two together, they\u2019re not comparable that way. They\u2019re answering two different questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Motemaden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, okay.

Good evening Evan. My first question - you know, last quarter, sticking with North America commercial, you had pointed to premium growth for the balance of the year kind of being above 7.6%, and you guys exceeded that margin by a good amount this quarter - as you said, good property growth. It seems like that was a good driver there. Can you just give us a sense of how you think premium growth can transpire over the balance of the year relative to your expectations last quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Elyse, I\u2019m feeling pretty good.

Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good evening Evan. First question I just had on cyber. First of all, where exactly does that live in the disclosures - is that in financial lines as well, and curious if you could give an update on the size of that book and how you\u2019re feeling about that business from a rate adequacy standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, as you statutorily have seen, we write a sizeable book, and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve disclosed the total global premium but what I would tell you is, is we\u2019re one of the top--you know, I don\u2019t have the updated numbers, so I want to be careful, but we\u2019re in the top 3 of cyber writers, maybe the top 2 of cyber writers globally. The business is growing in certain segments for us, but the overall business is growing and the rate environment has leveled off. Terms and conditions on what we underwrite are form. We were first to--really leaders to roll out a form that addresses systemic risk to a greater degree and addresses the severity in ransomware and other one-offs. The underwriting, we\u2019re vigilant about it. The growth, we\u2019re growing it. The pricing, it\u2019s pretty good in most segments. There\u2019s some segments that need rate, and in those areas we\u2019re leaning back a little bit. That\u2019s what I\u2019d tell you about cyber.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Appreciated the commentary, the line-by-line commentary on loss trend, but if I heard you correctly, I think you said workers comp, you\u2019re trending at around 4%--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think I said about 4.7%, from memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, well that\u2019s, I guess, a little bit higher than I would have thought that line was running at. Are you seeing any type of pick-up in inflation there? Are you trending it differently than you have in recent quarters, or--?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve increased it in the last--earlier in the year. You know, there\u2019s two things: one, mindful of medical inflation, and number two, payroll increases. On one hand, that benefits exposure change, as we just talked about rate and price, and on the other hand, wages go up and that translates to severity on the indemnity side. Those two things together rationally are going to push up your PIC on loss cost and comp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.

As you sit right now in Singapore and you look at your opportunity set, how would you rank concerns of capital deployment priorities, underwriting capacity given your views of achieving rate adequacy versus acquisitions in emerging markets, could even be JVs?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019m not--first of all, we have plenty of capital flexibility. That is not a question. We are not constraining organic growth whatsoever, and I can tell you--I would make two comments to you. We are not on the acquisition hunt. We are focused on what we--there is so much opportunity around what we\u2019ve got and strategy around organic growth. In Asia, we are just full up, it\u2019s fabulous. In North America and other parts of the world, we\u2019ve got plenty of growth opportunity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting after. We\u2019ve got a great rate environment to take on more exposure in areas like property, and we are taking--it\u2019s not a question of capital, it\u2019s a question of are you willing to take on the volatility that goes along with it, and we are because we think we\u2019re getting paid well for that. It\u2019s a good thing to invest in with shareholder capital, and that\u2019s our priority.

Yes, I wasn\u2019t implying that you don\u2019t have strong capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ve noticed that you reported $49 million of unfavorable reserve development for molestation claims - it\u2019s not a large number, but I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing right now on reviver statutes. Based on the work we\u2019ve done, are those charges reflecting the 11 states where new statute of limitation reform laws went into effect, or do the reserves also reflect the 38 states introduced new reform bills this year? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. You know, Tracy, it\u2019s more case specific. The only thing the reviver statutes as they open up them does, it opens up the top of the funnel, so more potential losses from years past, legacies going way back, events flowing to the top of the funnel, and then eventually some ripen, some percentage of them ripen into claims and cases, and ultimately in incurred. When we see a liability, we\u2019re going to reflect it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tracy Benguigui</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very basic question here - does statute of limitations only apply to child abuse, or is it more broad-based?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it depends on the state. It varies. Some have opened it up more broadly and some, it\u2019s only about--most, it\u2019s only about child abuse. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tracy Benguigui</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wait a minute - I think I have a colleague who may be correcting me about that.

Evan, looking at--you know, with Huatai going to be consolidated here and ownership increasing, life insurance is becoming a pretty meaningful component of your overall earnings mix - I think you\u2019ve got north of 10%. I\u2019m wondering if maybe you could give us a quick snapshot of what the business mix looks like there, how much is savings products versus indemnity products, short tail, long tail, is much of it capital intensive? Just give us some perspective on how we should think about that life insurance business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, about 80%, 90% of the business is straight up accident and health business, the same kind of business we write on the non-life side. In the life side, you write a longer duration policy, and they\u2019re all individual policies, so on the non-life side I may direct market the same kind of products and they\u2019re annually renewable and they have a certain lapse rate to them, and on the life side I may sell through them agents and/or through direct marketing, and it\u2019s dread disease and it\u2019s hospital cash and it\u2019s cancer and it\u2019s accident insurance, and it will be sold predominantly--most of the book we have are individual policies and they are longer duration, which adds great stability, a long term asset. Then there is a percentage, but it\u2019s a minority percentage of the business where it\u2019s tied to a savings and protection policy, but yet we load it up with accident and health riders, so you\u2019re going to buy a large amount of protection, the stuff we love, alongside a very traditional, much lower risk savings product that\u2019s either on a par basis, where okay, any interest rate risk is fundamentally to the customer and we share the upside with them, or it\u2019s got extremely low guarantees, like in the 1% range or 2% in a whole life policy, that\u2019s it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, that\u2019s helpful.

Then this one is more focused, I guess, on your personal lines business. I\u2019m just curious, could you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing happening in the regulatory environment, given the level of rate we\u2019ve seen going through in, like, personal auto and homeowners? Are you starting to see any pushback by regulators?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It varies by state. I think it\u2019s pretty well known to you, it\u2019s not hidden. We are employing where we want to grow exposure and we need more flexibility of terms or of rates. We are using E&amp;S to a greater extent as a tool to be able to take more exposure and do it in a thoughtful way and shape portfolios, and we do that both in states where exposure is concentrated in cat, and we\u2019re also doing it in states where the regulatory environment doesn\u2019t allow us greater flexibility to be able to actually serve the public\u2019s need. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.

But we have a really distinct, strong brand, and Meyer, I think the recognition of our brand and service, all things being equal, more customers, it\u2019s proven, in our cohort want to buy Chubb, and then it\u2019s a question of price and terms. There have been competitors who have been overly competitive in the area, and I think of--you know, in the past, naively so or for other reasons, have underpriced risk. We\u2019re in a market know, I think, where there\u2019s greater discipline in the business, and that creates opportunity for us, in addition to the notion of others who may have gotten it wrong and they\u2019re pulling back.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, we don\u2019t have an endless appetite, and we will shape our portfolio; but we\u2019re using every tool we can to take more risk and more exposure in a balanced way, not to become the cat writer of high net worth but the national writer of high net worth, balanced, and to do that in a thoughtful and sound way that is enduring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful.

Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Scott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. First one I had is on casualty in North America - you know, you all have been fairly vocal about the need for accelerating rate there. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on is that occurring at the rate you think you need it to for the industry to have adequate pricing, and what kind of competitive environment are you seeing there on casualty lines in North America?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I can\u2019t speak for the industry, but I can speak for Chubb. I like the level of rate we are securing and the terms and conditions against the various cohorts of casualty we write, and I think we\u2019re--I know we\u2019re staying on top of loss development and loss trends, and then we reflect it in the pricing and the terms. I have said in previous quarters that I thought these lines needed to move, and in fact they are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Scott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. The second question I had is around the casualty reserves - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen there\u2019s a fair amount of chatter around the 2013 to 2019 accident years and people looking at the loss cost trend on longer tail lines and thinking through, you know, should we be confident in those reserves. I appreciate this is probably a bit of an annoying question, but is there anything you would add to that discussion to help people think through your confidence in those reserves, just in light of the environment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, pretty simply I\u2019d say this - look at our track record. We\u2019ve been doing this for how long, how many decades, through all kinds of cycles, and look at our reserve policy and look at our reserving track record. And by the way, Peter just made some expansive comments around prior period reserve development, which is simply a reflection of strength of reserve. We are quite confident and comfortable with the level of our reserves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Scott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this time, I would like to turn today\u2019s call back over to Karen Beyer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Karen Beyer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we\u2019ll be around to take your call. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.
