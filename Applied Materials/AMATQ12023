During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session.</p> <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sullivan, Corporate Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.</p> <p><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p>Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining Applied\u2019s first quarter of fiscal 2023 earnings call.</p> <p>Joining me are Gary Dickerson, our President and CEO, and Brice Hill, our Chief Financial Officer.</p> <p>Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s call contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ. Information concerning the risks and uncertainties is contained in Applied\u2019s most recent Form 10-K filing with the SEC.</p> <p>Today\u2019s call also includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to GAAP measures are found in today\u2019s earnings press release and in our quarterly earnings materials, which are available on the IR page of our website at appliedmaterials.com.</p> <p>Before we begin, I have a calendar announcement. Later this month, Applied Materials is participating in the SPIE Advanced Lithography and Patterning Conference. For those who aren\u2019t traveling to San Jose for the conference, we<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> plan to hold a new product launch event on our IR Website on Tuesday, February 28th at 9 am Pacific Time. We hope you\u2019ll join us.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And with that introduction, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Gary Dickerson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thank you, Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Applied Materials executed well in our first fiscal quarter, delivering results towards the high end of our guidance range. We also grew our backlog for the ninth consecutive quarter. Going forward, we expect backlog to start declining as we move through 2023. Overall, we are making good progress closing our supply-versus-demand gap. However, very recently, one of our major suppliers encountered a disruption that will impact our second quarter shipments. Brice will provide more details about this when he shares our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In my prepared remarks, I will cover three main topics: Our current outlook for 2023; our longer-term growth thesis for the industry, and how Applied is positioned to grow faster than our markets overall; and finally, a brief overview of the investments we are making to productively scale the company and accelerate our customers\u2019 roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me begin with our near-term perspective on the market. In this environment of mixed macroeconomic signals, our customers are facing a variety of demand dynamics. Consumer-driven markets, including PCs and smartphones are clearly weaker, while inflection-driven markets remain more resilient, especially high-performance computing and AI, automotive, industrial automation, and clean energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of wafer fab equipment investments, 2023 will be a down year for memory spending as customers rebalance inventories and defer capacity additions in both NAND and DRAM. We expect DRAM to pick up ahead of NAND, potentially beginning to recover later this calendar year. We now see leading-edge foundry-logic spending being slightly down year-on-year. While near-term demand headwinds are causing customers to trim capacity additions, they remain firmly committed to strategic investments in advanced nodes to win the battle for next-generation technology leadership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our view of ICAPS, chips for IoT, Communications, Auto, Power and Sensor applications, is incrementally more positive than it was last quarter, and we now see spending being up year-on-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Leading ICAPS companies are investing in both technology and capacity to serve growing demand across a wide range of verticals. In addition, there is strong government support around the world to build resilient, regionalized ICAPS supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on what we are seeing in our business and hearing from our customers, we believe Applied Materials is well positioned to outperform the market in 2023. The resilience in our business is driven by several contributing factors: First, our balanced market exposure which allows us to perform well in a variety of spending mix environments. Second, our position with technology leaders who remain focused on investing in their long-term strategies. We have strong positions at all the key technology inflections in advanced foundry-logic, ICAPS, DRAM, and advanced packaging. Third, our record backlog, of which a significant percentage is made up of our most differentiated products including metal deposition that is uniquely enabling for critical next-generation wiring resistance improvements. And finally, our service business which is on track to grow in 2023, even after the impact of current U.S. export control regulations. More than 60% of our service revenue is generated from subscriptions in the form of long-term agreements. These agreements have an average tenure of 2.6 years and a high renewal rate of more than 90%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we are cognizant of near-term volatility in our markets and ready to respond to both upside or downside, our long-term outlook remains highly positive. Semiconductors are the foundation of the digital economy making them more strategically and economically important than ever before. Around the world, governments are incentivizing the industry to build regional manufacturing capacity and accelerate investments in strategic next-generation technologies. The semiconductor industry remains on track to grow from approximately $600 billion in 2022 to a $1 trillion or more by the end of this decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Technology complexity of chips is increasing significantly as traditional 2D Moore\u2019s Law scaling slows and the industry transitions to a new PPACt playbook to drive improved performance, power, area-cost and time-to-market. In addition, as 2D Moore\u2019s Law decelerates, we are seeing average die sizes in advanced foundry-logic grow. This drives the need for additional wafer capacity while also accelerating the transition to chiplets and heterogeneous designs. Beyond advanced packaging, major technology inflections in transistor, wiring, and patterning are also enabled by new materials and materials engineering. These inflections increase the size of Applied\u2019s available market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we have been investing in these inflections for multiple years, we are now well positioned to capture a larger share of our available market. We have a deep pipeline of solutions to enable new wiring innovations, Gate-All-Around transistors, backside power delivery, heterogeneous integration and hybrid bonding. Our broad portfolio of products enables us to offer customers traditional unit process equipment all the way to integrated materials solutions, or IMS, that combine multiple process technologies with on-board metrology and advanced data analytics in a single platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are very confident about the growth trajectory of the industry and Applied\u2019s outperformance within that environment. To support this growth, we are making strategic investments in new manufacturing, logistics and R&amp;D infrastructure. The scale, speed and location of these investments will be dependent on receiving government support, some of which we have already secured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beyond simply expanding capacity, we see these infrastructure investments as a catalyst to change the way we collaborate with customers, suppliers and research partners. For example, in the coming months, we expect to break ground on our next-generation R&amp;D center in Silicon Valley. We believe this new high-velocity platform will increase innovation and commercialization speed while reducing the overall cost of bringing new manufacturing technologies to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the industry and Applied Materials scale, we need to do so productively and efficiently. This is a major strategic theme for us and, across the Company, we are focused on driving up productivity and implementing new ways to work that are better and faster.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I hand the call over to Brice, let me summarize.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While the economy and semiconductor industry are facing challenges in 2023, we remain confident that Applied is well positioned to outperform our markets this year. Our resilience is underpinned by our large backlog of differentiated products, growing service business, and strong positions with leading customers at key technology inflections. Our longer-term outlook remains highly positive as secular trends create opportunities for Applied to outgrow the semiconductor and wafer fab equipment markets by enabling the PPACt roadmap with our differentiated portfolio of materials engineering solutions. In line with this view, we are making strategic investments in R&amp;D and infrastructure, while driving improvements in productivity and speed across the organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now Brice, it\u2019s over to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Gary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d like to start by thanking our team and our supply chain partners for helping us deliver strong revenue in a dynamic environment. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll summarize our Q1 results and provide our guidance for Q2. Before going into the near term, I\u2019d like to discuss the broader context for the industry and the Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past few cycles, the semiconductor industry has become significantly larger and more diverse. Applied\u2019s revenue and earnings have grown and become more resilient over this period. In Semiconductor Systems, more than half our revenue comes from leadership businesses where our market segment share is near or well above 50%. The growth of our services business has added another dimension of stability. These factors strengthen our confidence in our ability to invest, generate high returns, and return capital to shareholders. Our business model is very efficient and generates attractive returns. In fact, from fiscal 2013 through 2022, we have grown Applied\u2019s free cash flow at a compound annual rate of 30% and increased our return on invested capital to over 35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have three capital allocation priorities. The first is funding future growth and returns, and the second is maintaining a strong balance sheet so we can fund R&amp;D through market cycles. Accordingly, even though the semiconductor market is weaker this year, we are investing to scale the Company to support our customers in what we believe will be a trillion-dollar semiconductor market. We are increasing our manufacturing and logistics capacity, and we are making significant investments in our R&amp;D infrastructure to collaborate more closely and productively with our customers and industry partners to help solve their highest-value problems. Our third capital allocation priority is returning excess cash to shareholders. We have committed to return 80 to 100% of free cash flow, and actual returns for the past 10 years have been 106%. We have repurchased 40% of shares outstanding at the beginning of this period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the business has become larger and more diverse, we\u2019ve also increased the dividend. We\u2019ve increased our quarterly dividend per share at a 14% CAGR over the past 17 years. In fact, operating income from our services business alone more than covers a growing dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, I want our investors to know that we are increasingly focused on improving our productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We increased our full-time employee base by around 20% last year and have restricted hiring to critical positions and slowed our spending growth. R&amp;D is our largest expense, and we are making portfolio decisions to ensure we generate the highest possible returns from our investments. We also see opportunities to make our manufacturing more predictable and efficient, and have formed new teams to drive our operational goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving now to our Q1 financials, we delivered net sales of nearly $6.74 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.03. These results were in the upper end of our guidance range and nearly identical to last quarter\u2019s record results. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 80 basis points sequentially to 46.8%, primarily driven by improved manufacturing and logistics costs along with pricing adjustments. Non-GAAP OpEx was nearly $1.17 billion, with about two-thirds of the sequential increase from R&amp;D.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the segments, Semi Systems revenue grew by 13% year-over-year to $5.16 billion. Strength in ICAPS more than offset reductions in memory and advanced foundry-logic. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 37.3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">AGS revenue grew nearly 4% year-over-year in Q1 to approximately $1.37 billion. AGS absorbed a full quarter of revenue impact from U.S. trade regulations and performed better than the midpoint of our expectations. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Display, revenue declined to $167 million, and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 4.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our cash flows, we generated $2.27 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter, which was 34% of revenue. We returned $470 million to shareholders including $220 million in dividends and $250 million in buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll share our guidance for Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect revenue to be nearly $6.4 billion, plus or minus $400 million, or up over 2% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.84 plus or minus $0.18. This guidance includes a negative estimated adjustment of $250 million related to a cybersecurity event that was recently announced by one of our suppliers. Based on our current assessment of the situation, we expect to recover all of this revenue, and the majority of it in Q3. We expect Semi Systems revenue to be about $4.84 billion, which is up over 8% year-over-year. We expect AGS revenue to be about $1.34 billion, which is down around 3% year-over-year including the negative impact of recent U.S. trade regulations. Display revenue should be around $160 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect Applied\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 46.5% which is lower quarter-over-quarter primarily driven by lower volumes and higher near-term supply chain logistics costs, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.16 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.5% and a weighted average share count of 850 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll close my remarks today by saying thank you to our long-term investors for your support. We are investing for the future with confidence. Our products and services are being directed to a semiconductor industry that is growing in size and strategic importance to the global economy. Our business model is highly efficient, with low capital intensity and a high return on invested capital, driven primarily by R&amp;D spending deployed in close collaboration with our customers. Our business has become less volatile and more resilient as semiconductor demand has broadened to more markets. Equipment capital intensity has recovered and our services business has grown larger and more subscription-based.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fact, over the past five fiscal years, we\u2019ve increased non-GAAP net income by 87%, generated $18.7 billion in free cash flow, and returned 118% of free cash flow to investors. Looking forward, we believe the growing complexity of the semiconductor roadmap and our ability to deliver the innovations required by our customers will enable us to grow faster than the industry. We plan to expand our global R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure, including the plans Gary previewed. Finally, we will focus on increasing our productivity and maintaining our efficient spending model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now Mike, let\u2019s please begin the Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Brice. To help us reach as many people as we can, please ask just one question on today\u2019s call. If you have another question, please requeue and we\u2019ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let\u2019s please begin.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C.J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess I was hoping to get a little more color on the backlog side of things. To what degree do you think dollar-wise that will kind of contribute to you here in calendar \u201823? And as part of that, I guess, how are you thinking about kind of first half versus second half, whether on a fiscal or calendar year basis, kind of silicon trends as that backlog unwinds? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great. Hi C.J. And thanks for the question. So on our backlog, just taking a step back, we did see a lot of activity with movement in orders during the quarter. As we\u2019ve described before, we go through our orders each quarter, work with the customers to update them. And there was a lot of movement. We do see the weakness in the market that everybody else sees in the leading edge, logic and in memory. But as Gary pointed out, we did have strong bookings in the quarter and our backlog actually grew. We think that more than half of that backlog would be executed this year. And as Gary also pointed out, we expect that we\u2019ll begin to work that down toward a more normal level as we start to improve supply chain and be able to ship the demand that we\u2019re still shipping from last year, really, we\u2019re still working in some of our business units to cover the demand that we had last year. So, it has been a little bit of a buffer, the strong backlog against the weakness in the market for us, and we think it\u2019s going to take the rest of the year, probably 1 to 4 quarters, depending on the business unit, we\u2019re thinking about to work through to normalize the lead times and recover the backlog that we need to ship against.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. C.J., one other thing I would add is that the largest part of our backlog is with our leadership products, especially MDP and implants. So again, that gives us strength as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And C.J., we\u2019re not giving the guidance for the second half, but we\u2019ll just say that as I highlighted, more than half of that backlog is in the year, so it\u2019s definitely helping the year. It is buffering us Q1, Q2. And it does give us confidence that we had strong bookings in the quarter. And we\u2019ll probably talk more about this, but we\u2019ll highlight that the ICAPS markets are very strong. In fact, demand has been accelerating in those markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I actually wanted to dig a little bit into that strong ICAPS demand. Is it coming from -- I mean, is it focused in areas like China where at this point after the restrictions they\u2019re going to be forced to take a much harder look at their efforts in trailing node versus a leading node? And I guess, as an add-on to that, are you concerned at all about the strength in ICAPS? Is there any concern about overbuild, I guess, as we go through the year, as that gets built out?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi Stacy. Thanks for the question. First of all, it\u2019s broad-based, I guess, would be my first answer on the ICAPS. We had significant growth last year that we highlighted when we did our year-end call, and it\u2019s actually accelerating into this year. So I\u2019ll come back to whether that\u2019s a concern or not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">China is the largest region and the largest single country driving ICAPS. So, it is a focus area. We\u2019re actually not concerned that it\u2019s going to be affected by trade regulations. So, that\u2019s not on the radar screen at this point. As we think about ICAPS and we think about that broad-based strength, you\u2019re probably aware or certainly aware that many of the companies that we know are leading ICAPS manufacturers have announced that they\u2019re adding capacity, and the capital intensity for those companies is increasing. And I think it just is a reflection of there\u2019s little used factories and used equipment available in the market. And so, as companies need to add capacity to serve this market, they\u2019re having to make the new investments. We do think it\u2019s sustainable. We do think it\u2019s being driven by, in some cases, are being supported in some cases by government incentives. But we\u2019re not concerned that companies will put capital in place that they don\u2019t plan to use. We don\u2019t think the incentives are enough to have somebody install equipment and not use it just in the hopes of using it. So, we\u2019re also fairly confident in the underlying demand, things like electrification, electric vehicles, sustainable power. All these types of markets we think are sustainable. So we just -- we\u2019re seeing an acceleration in that area for our business, and we think it will continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Stacy, the one thing I would add too is if you remember, several years ago, you had a lot of used equipment as the foundry business model was emerging. So that really depressed capital intensity for a number of years. And of course, that\u2019s not happening now. So capital intensity is up, and our position there is very good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m curious, does your Q2 outlook kind of reflect the trough of memory demand, or you think there is a lot more memory weakness that you could see in the second half? Because it\u2019s just that when I look at your outlook, right, it seems to be very different than what we have seen from your other U.S. peers who are down 20%, 30% sequentially in their calendar Q1. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the ICAPS strength that explains that delta. So, I\u2019m just puzzled as to what explains that outperformance. Is it ICAPS, is it something else? Or have you not yet seen the trough of memory weakness and that is still to come that maybe they saw it earlier, and you could see more of it in the back half? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the question, Vivek. We\u2019re fairly confident that we\u2019re current with our memory customers on their orders. We\u2019ve definitely seen -- as I highlighted in our booking activity, we definitely have seen significant cancellations and pushouts from memory customers. We think we\u2019re current. Mathematically, you\u2019re exactly right. The acceleration in ICAPS has more than offset the weakness we\u2019re seeing there and any slowdown we saw in leading-edge logic. So, that\u2019s true. And then, we\u2019ve looked at the leading indicators on the memory side. We\u2019re still seeing pricing declines. We\u2019re still seeing inventory increases. So, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s turning yet, at least from our perspective, but we\u2019re confident we\u2019re current with the customers, Vivek.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brice, maybe just one for you. I notice you did not quantify WFE for this year, and I understand you\u2019re probably better than the industry because of the ICAPS strength. But it seems like the range is anywhere from 70 to 75 and some people talk about $80 billion in WFE this year. But just hypothetically speaking, if WFE is down 20 or so more percent since you\u2019re going to outperform, is it fair to assume your revenue growth to be down more like low to mid-teens? And kind of how to think about the earnings power in that scenario given that you\u2019re trying to be disciplined on OpEx? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks Krish. So yes, we didn\u2019t provide a WFE because we\u2019re really just trying to focus on sharing what we\u2019re seeing, all the signals that we\u2019re getting in the market because we\u2019re a little bit abstracted from it. As you pointed out, we\u2019ve got the strength and acceleration in ICAPS that may make us a little bit different. We\u2019re also still shipping orders we had from \u201822. So for us, we\u2019re catching up to demand, especially in some of the key differentiated business units that existed before the year. So, it\u2019s not a perfect match, and it\u2019s difficult for us to estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Switching to OpEx. As we talked about in our last call, because we were supply constrained, our OpEx growth, that was our plan, was a little bit ahead of our revenue growth. So, we have implemented headcount targets. We\u2019ve moved to strategic hiring only, and we do have initiatives focused on improving our productivity on spending. So we\u2019re conscious of that. Of course, it\u2019s a balancing act, Krish, through this year because we think the industry is growing. We\u2019re confident in the direction we need to continue investing in R&amp;D. So that\u2019s our primary goal is to deliver those programs to customers. We have flexibility, if the environment deteriorates for us, then we\u2019ll make more appropriate changes to spending. But right now, we\u2019re comfortable with the trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question coming from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Nice job in the execution. So, Brice, it does sound like ICAPS is the driver for your outperformance at least in the near term versus the peers. And historically, in your Master Classes, you have talked about ICAPS being around 25% of your silicon portfolio. And I\u2019m curious where do you think you\u2019re running this business at right now? And if you could comment on within ICAPS is auto or silicon carbide the strongest area for you? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Atif. Yes. I think that we\u2019ve characterized foundry logic as two-thirds of the business last year. Memory is a little slower this year, so that mix is changing a little bit. And we characterized our lagging edge or the ICAPS portion as about 50-50 with leading edge. So that\u2019s the way we characterize it. And that\u2019s all thinking of it from a TAM perspective. What we are seeing at the company level is that the ICAPS market is accelerating and growing at a very high rate for the Company this year. And we think part of that is driven by government incentives and part of that is driven by the higher intensity and part of that is driven by the strength in the end markets that I highlighted. And maybe, Gary, on the silicon carbide, you could make a comment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Let me just give a little bit more color. So, ICAPS relative to market share is similar for us with leading foundry logic. So, we\u2019ve grown share in ICAPS a significant amount over the last few years. It\u2019s also accretive to our overall gross margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Four years ago, I think we\u2019ve talked about this, we formed the ICAPS IoT, communication, auto power, sensors, organization because we could see these markets were going to grow at a significant pace. So we pulled together a really strong team. We have the broadest exposure. If you look at all of the technologies, whether it\u2019s in -- again, any of those different segments within ICAPS, we have significant strength. So again, that\u2019s something that we saw several years ago and made investments. So, we have many ICAPS specific products. Implant is one area if we look at. There\u2019s many areas where we have strength and broad exposure in ICAPS. But in that particular area, we\u2019ve introduced 10 new products focused on ICAPS in the last five years. That is the largest segment of our implant business. And just in that one area, again, we\u2019ve been very supply constrained, we expect that we can double our ICAPS revenue in \u201823 versus \u201822. So again, just really across the board we have very, very strong positions. And pulling that organization together four years ago, really put us in a good position for what we\u2019re seeing today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had one quick clarification and then a question. Gary, you just mentioned that you expect your ICAPS revenue to double in \u201823 versus \u201822. Was that overall ICAPS, or was that just implant? That\u2019s my clarification question. And then my question, Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your DRAM business potentially recovering by the end of the year, which to me is a little surprising, just given how weak the trends are in that marketplace today and the inventory situation. Can you kind of share what informs that view in DRAM? And what are your thoughts on NAND as well? Thank you .</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Let me cover the -- first question is on the doubling of ICAPS. That\u2019s specifically implant in \u201823 versus \u201822. And part of was just the supply chain challenges that we had in \u201822 that limited our output. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s happening there in -- with ICAP. And Brice, do you want to cover the DRAM NAND question?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think in the DRAM and NAND, we have seen the weakening in memory. We do expect that next year will improve on the memory perspective. I don\u2019t think, Toshiya, we\u2019re going to give an exact moment when the market will turn. I mentioned earlier, we kind of have three signals that we can look at internally. We can look at utilization for both NAND and DRAM. And we see utilization lower this quarter and all of our customers are forecasting utilization to be even lower next quarter. We\u2019ve looked at the pricing of memory, and it looks like it\u2019s either declining or declining -- or slightly flattening. And then we\u2019ve looked at inventories and it looks like inventories are still growing. So I don\u2019t think at this point that we can say, call the point in time where memory starts to grow. But we do expect next year that memory will improve and companies will begin to invest again. And it\u2019s just difficult to call that moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brice, I had a question on backlog. It seems like backlog is sort of skewing your numbers a bit higher than your peers, given how long your lead times began or got to during the upturn. So, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us maybe a few more breadcrumbs on the backlog. I think you said last quarter, SSG backlog was $12.7 billion. So I just want to be clear that the SSG backlog went up from that number. And if so, that\u2019s kind of like 2.5 quarters of backlog for SSG. And when I think of a normal, you always used to run more like a quarter-and-a-half worth of SSG backlog. So, is it right to conclude after all that that you maybe have a quarter\u2019s worth of excess backlog right now as it relates to SSG?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think -- thanks, Tim, for the question. So color on it, I would say we did see weakness in leading logic and memory as we described. So, a lot of the strength that we\u2019re seeing comes back to this acceleration on the ICAPS side. So from a mix perspective, I think that\u2019s where a lot of strength in the orders is coming from. And Gary highlighted the growth of implant. So certainly not -- the growth of total ICAPS is not 100%, but it is very meaningful to us for the year, obviously, enough in Q1 to offset weakness in memory and leading logic. So, that gives you some of the perspective. Most of this is in the semi business. Some of it\u2019s in 200-millimeter, which comes in the AGS space. And what I would say is, yes, it does tie back to the long lead times in the areas of the business that are highly differentiated equipment, where we\u2019re still working off that backlog. And we think it will take us -- I guess what I would say is -- last quarter, we highlighted that a normal backlog would probably be in the $12 billion or $13 billion range. We expect to work back in that direction as supply improves, and we can start catching up to the demand we had from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I guess, Brice, just to confirm, so the SSG backlog did go up from $12.7 billion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m looking at the data, Tim, to see if I can see this. Can you see it? Yes, sir.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, maybe one thing I would add that just kind of gets back to a lot of the questions. We do have strength in many of these key technology inflections. We talked in the Master Classes about inflections gate all around, wiring, memory with capacitor formation or new materials, PDC strength. We had that Master Class in December. So that\u2019s another thing. When you look at the composition of the backlog, just again, wiring alone, we have one inflection that enables a 50% reduction in resistance. The dollar per wafer goes up about 3x from 7 to 3-nanometer. So, those areas are also helping us in relative performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given the unprecedented sort of excess inventory situation in the memory space, your memory customers are being very disciplined, right? They\u2019re taking drastic actions to rein in supply, even going so far as to push out their technology migration road maps. Typically in downturns, we wouldn\u2019t see your customers pulling back on tech migrations, capacity add, yes, but not tech migration. So, is the tech migration pullback in the associated higher capital intensity a big contributor to the WFE pullback this year in memory? And just as importantly, does this mean the potential for a sharper spending recovery as memory fundamentals start to normalize because all of your memory customers are going to try to aggressively get realigned on their tech migration road maps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. I\u2019ll start, and Gary will probably want to add something here. I don\u2019t think that the inventory situation in the current market is guiding their technology transition choices. I think that will be driven by their opportunity to take leadership positions and improve the cost of the bits and improve the product performance, et cetera. So, what does happen is they may have more equipment that they can reuse into their road map depending on what demand is. So, they\u2019ll make changes and lower their equipment buys based on that. So, I think -- I\u2019m not aware of companies for -- that are connecting the technology ramp decision with the current inventory situation and business situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Harlan, I would say that your view of memory strengthening, we said DRAM potentially by the end of the calendar year and memory strengthening into \u201824, we would share that perspective. What I would say is that we are -- we also believe that foundry logic will remain strong going forward. It was in this kind of two-thirds, one-third mix between foundry logic and memory. And especially with government incentives, you see a lot of government incentives certainly in the U.S., in Europe, Japan, a number of different areas, potentially in India. That could add a few billion dollars per year in additional investment. And again, the profile of higher foundry logic versus memory, we think that\u2019s going to sustain for a number of years going into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Quatrochi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask about the backlog fulfillment kind of working that back down to more normalized levels or at least 50% of that kind of where you\u2019re at today. How do we think about that from your ability to increase production supply versus your orders maybe slowing from your customers. I guess, how do we split that out in terms of understanding what\u2019s driving backlog there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was a little hard to hear the second part of that question. But let me start with working down the backlog, Joe. Thanks for the question, Joe. So I guess the way we\u2019re thinking about it, it\u2019s hard to estimate the order flow coming in and estimate the exact backlog number. But we\u2019ve got several business units that are still shipping against demand really that we received last year. And it has been supply constrained. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re behind 1 to 4 quarters depending on the business unit that we think of. So we think as supply has improved, we\u2019ll begin to ship back against last year\u2019s orders and recover to a normal position. And the quickest business unit, we\u2019ll probably do that in the next quarter. Then we do have one or two business units that will take into next year to be able to recover that. I don\u2019t know -- go ahead and -- Joe, can you say the second part of your question, again. There was some line noise kind of blocked it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Quatrochi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I apologize. The second part is just trying to understand the other piece of aside from supply is -- are you predicating on orders being resilient to take that long to get back down to a more normalized level, or are you expecting orders to maybe slow?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019re not really -- I guess I would say we\u2019re not really expecting orders to slow. Like I said, we\u2019re current in the environment. And so, as we think towards next year, we expect \u201824 to be a better year across the whole industry, memory, leading logic, et cetera. So at some point, we expect there to be stability in the market. We saw strong orders this period. I can\u2019t predict if it will be strong every cycle. But as we head towards \u201824, we think there\u2019ll be firmer footing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question coming from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sidney Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You guys talk about leading-edge foundry and logic spending down slightly this year. I was just hoping that you can double-click on that a little bit. Based on your business, how do you see the ramp of 3-nanometer production, say, by the end of this year as compared to maybe years past for leading edge? And also, how does that compare to your expectations maybe 3 to 6 months ago? And maybe you can talk about transit outside of 3 nanometers, that would be great. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. I\u2019ll start on that one, on the leading-edge. So I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward. The largest leading-edge customers are running at lower utilization at this point. And so, they\u2019re resizing their capital buys as they look at the utilization level that they are now. So, we\u2019ve seen pushouts or cancellations of some tools related to those customers. And I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward. They have lower utilization and they have the ability to reuse some of that equipment into their next ramp. And then, I don\u2019t think we typically comment on the timing of the other nodes. But Gary, do you want to make a comment about 3-nanometer?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. What I would say is that from what we\u2019re hearing from customers, the demand for 3-nanometer is very strong. And that looks like that\u2019s going to be a very big investment for our customers. And again, for us, the positions there, we\u2019ve covered that in a lot of the Master Classes, we expect our share of gate-all-around to rise versus FinFET, about 5 points. And we have the majority of the spending in that inflection. I\u2019ve talked about those wiring inflections where the dollar per wafer goes up significantly from one technology node to the next. And again, we\u2019ve covered those in the Master Classes. So, our position at 3-nanometer is very strong. Our position gets stronger even in 2-nanometer as customers are driving improvements in power and performance. So, our position there is very good. And again, what we\u2019re hearing from customers is significant demand for 3-nanometer and then the timing, we\u2019ll let them comment on the timing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Quinn Bolton from Needham.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Quinn Bolton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just hoping you could help reconcile something for me. Obviously, it sounds like the ICAPS business is very strong in 2023. You said China is the biggest part of ICAPS. But when I look at your China revenue, it looks like it\u2019s down 40% over the past year from about $2 billion to $1.15 billion. So just trying to reconcile that the slower pace of revenue in China versus the ICAPS strength you\u2019re seeing. I guess, is that ICAPS strength really coming from non-China regions, or do you expect a nice recovery in China as you come through 2023? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Quinn. The strength in ICAPS is broad-based. So, it is growing worldwide, but China is the largest country, and most of the demand that we see in China is really ICAPS-related because the memory investments and leading logic investments are essentially zero or close to zero. That\u2019s where most of that investment is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would say that relative to ICAPS profile in \u201823, China is remaining at a similar level. But there is growth, significant growth in the other regions. So, I think your assumption is pretty close to what we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have one clarification and one follow-up. The $250 million that is pushed out to the July quarter, could that potentially help with a rather stable SSG revenue trend? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how the $250 million pushout could impact SSG two quarters out. And then, would you be able to help me understand how big is ion implant within ICAPS?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Mehdi. I\u2019ll take the -- I\u2019ll take the $250 million. So, we do expect -- none of that demand is perishable. So yes, in your model, I would take that $250 million and add it to whatever you\u2019re modeling for Q3. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get exactly all in Q3, but we think we\u2019ll get it most in Q3 based on our current assumptions. And then, to the extent that there\u2019s weakness in the second half, if there is, then it would offset that to a degree, just like you\u2019re describing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Mehdi, relative to ion implant [Technical Difficulty]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019m just trying to understand how big is ion implant within ICAPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Technical Difficulty] Sorry. Sorry, I didn\u2019t push the button. So, relative to implant ICAPS, we haven\u2019t quantified the amount -- the size of that business. But it is the largest segment within implant, Mehdi. And we -- and as I said earlier, that we believe that we can double that, roughly double that implant ICAPS revenue from \u201822 to \u201823. We\u2019re the leader in that segment, and it is significant. But we have really broad exposure across multiple products within ICAPS. As you know, it\u2019s not really shrink-driven, it\u2019s more materials and structures-driven market. We\u2019re the leader in that market, and we expect that will remain strong in \u201823 and going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Chin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe just in terms of the backlog discussion, I guess it sounds like -- is there a disproportionate amount of the backlog that is geared towards ICAPS, and that\u2019s really even net of pushouts or cancellations that may be happening in memory, for example? This is really I guess, the main reason why your revenue is as resilient in terms of near-term shipments, kind of the net product is just beneficial. Is that the right way of thinking about it generally?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Brian, thanks for the question. I do think it\u2019s fair. I didn\u2019t parse backlog in exactly the way that you described. But to your point, we\u2019re seeing significant strength accelerating demand from our ICAPS customers that\u2019s filling in blanks that we get on the memory or leading logic side. And so to the extent that that -- our backlog represents the orders that we\u2019re shipping, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s a significant amount of ICAPS strengths across that backlog. So, I think that dynamic is fair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just going back to those end markets, we do think it\u2019s sustainable. We don\u2019t think the strength is anything unusual or driven by any unusual activity. We don\u2019t think companies are putting in capacity that they won\u2019t use. This is just growth that, as Gary said, that we\u2019ve seen coming for a while and it\u2019s starting to build out, and you might have seen some of the big -- larger companies in the ICAPS space talking about these investments. So I think you\u2019ll see it pretty much across the globe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Chin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And I imagine some of those cylinders aren\u2019t even firing at the moment, too. So that\u2019s probably not bad as well.

And operator, we have time for two more questions, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question coming from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Blayne Curtis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just curious the message on overall foundry logic. So clearly, ICAPS is up. I\u2019m just trying to understand if you could just talk about what\u2019s kind of the trends have been in leading edge. And I think some has kind of talked about it being kind of slightly down for the year as a market. Just kind of curious what you\u2019re seeing. You talked about it getting a bit weaker on leading edge. Can you just clarify how much it has? And just walk us through kind of last couple of months in leading-edge foundry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Blayne, I think slightly weaker, we won\u2019t give an exact number. We may not see the exact number either. But, when we look -- when we think about the big customers in foundry logic, that everybody knows, they have had reductions in our capital plans. When we look at leading foundry logic, when we look at utilization, it is low at this period of time. So their customers, our customers\u2019 customers are working through inventories at this point in time. But when you start to turn the page, the leading logic is going to invest in the next nodes and put that capacity in place. They may have a little bit more equipment available for reuse but they\u2019re going to make those investments. And we expect that and we see that coming through. And so, we\u2019ll -- when we get past this year, we\u2019ll expect to see strength in foundry logic again. Gary, do you want to add anything to that one? Okay. We\u2019re good. Thanks for the question, Blayne.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question coming from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Rakesh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi, Gary on Brice. Going back on the backlog again, I think you mentioned your backlog is current. Does that imply that the memory exposure or memory within that is fairly small given all the cancellations? And then a follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi Vijay. I don\u2019t know if -- first of all, it\u2019s current. We\u2019ve definitely gone through and made changes to the backlog based on our current customer situations. Whether we have more exposure or not, it depends on how things go. The macroeconomic factors are also important if there\u2019s -- some people think there will be a recession, some people don\u2019t. So it really depends on where the economy goes for the second half. But all we can say is we\u2019re current. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re missing signals in the market, and we don\u2019t think there\u2019s impending changes. It will just depend on which way the underlying demand goes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Rakesh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then on the China side, it is down 14% sequentially, and it looks like probably the third quarter was still going down. Is it fair to assume that it\u2019s fairly close to a trough there on the China spend side, given some of the ICAPS commentary that you had out of China?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We won\u2019t call it exact trough, but I think it\u2019s a fair thought because we expect over time display will grow. We expect our services business will grow. And certainly, China is mostly an ICAPS businesses at this point, and we\u2019re expecting strong growth there. So, I won\u2019t call a trough, but if you ask, are the effects of the trade rules, have we absorbed those effects, I think the answer is yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks Vijay for your question. And now, Brice, would you like to give us your closing thoughts today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mike. Absolutely. So today, we emphasized that our backlog of enabling products, our ICAPS growth and our strength in services are helping us to be resilient in this market. We\u2019re confident in the long-term growth of the semiconductor industry and committed to building the technology and capacity to support our customers. Thank you all for attending this call. We look forward to seeing many of you at our offices this quarter, and I look forward to attending the Morgan Stanley conference in a few weeks. Mike, thank you, and please close today\u2019s call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks, Brice. And I\u2019d like to add my own closing message, which is please do join us on February 28th for our Patterning Product Launch webcast. You can find a registration link on the Events page of our IR website, where we\u2019ll also post a replay of today\u2019s call by 5 o\u2019clock Pacific Time today. So, thank you for joining us this afternoon and for your continued interest in Applied Materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.
