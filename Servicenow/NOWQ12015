[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Scarpelli, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.</p> <p><strong>Michael Scarpelli</strong></p> <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our Chief Executive Officer. Our press release and a simultaneous broadcast of this call can be accessed at investors.servicenow.com.</p> <p>We will make forward-looking statements on this conference call such as those using the words may, will, expects, believes, or similar phrases, to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions.</p> <p>Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.</p> <p>I would now like to turn the call over to<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> Frank.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. Total revenues for the first quarter were $212 million. The quarter was marked by solid demand from our existing customer base, with a 97% renewal rate and a 32% upsell rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">We booked eight<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> new transactions with annualized contract value above $1 million. The company now has 168 customers with an annualized contract value in excess of $1 million. We also landed 23 net new Global 2000 customers, bringing our total to 545, including Illumina, a global leader in gene sequencing and array based technologies; Southern Company, a premier energy company based in Atlanta; the National Bank of Canada; Wolseley, a leading supplier of building materials; and Lennar, one of the nation\u2019s largest home builders.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As our customers expand their use of ServiceNow, we see them using our solutions not just to support the business, but increasingly, to actually run the business. H&amp;R Block Canada stood up a new application on ServiceNow during the quarter, just in time for tax season. The company used ServiceNow to support their annual field office readiness, providing the executive team with a dashboard view of the work associated with preparing 600 stores for tax season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The success of that program kicked off additional ServiceNow projects they will be pursuing over the coming year. The U.S. Postal Service created a stamp fulfilment application on ServiceNow with Accenture Federal Services in just 21 days. That application allows the agency to better manage the inventory of more than 20 billion stamps based on local customer demand at 34,000 retail locations. This helps the Postal Service minimize the disposal of unused stamps, directly impacting the agency\u2019s $7 billion in stamp sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the first quarter, we launched our latest software feature release, extending service management across the enterprise to marketing, legal, and finance. This release allows business functions to configure their own services and workflows with dedicated analytics and dashboards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For many of our customers, the objective is to create an integrated service experience across all departments and enterprise functions. We helped AAA Allied Group reduce their reliance on email across eight different departments. The customer has said that any interaction with the business will go through ServiceNow. Their marketing department is using ServiceNow to manage creative service requests, taking that service out of email to provide a more efficient and structured workflow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our latest release also provides a new financial management application to help organizations better understand the costs associated with delivering a service. ServiceNow Financial Management gives CIOs an interactive dashboard that maps IT costs imported from the general ledger due to consumption of services, allowing them to drive dynamic cost allocation around an arbitrary IT tax. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we also acquired a company called Intreis to help us develop our solutions in the governance, risk, and compliance segment. We see an opportunity to change the way organizations manage risk by running their compliance process on ServiceNow. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve already helped the emergency services/telecommunications authority in Australia transform their audit and risk function. According to the customer, this initiative reduced the collection time for critical compliance data by 93%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before closing, please be advised of our upcoming annual conference, Knowledge 15, which will take place in Las Vegas next week. We expect approximately 9,000 attendees to share experiences and learn how others achieve success with ServiceNow. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Knowledge 15, we will also be hosting CreatorCon, our first conference specifically aimed at application developers. CreatorCon is part of a broader launch of programs to build a community of highly skilled ServiceNow developers. This will be open to customers, partners, as well as ISVs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To help those partners and developers monetize their work, we will also be launching the ServiceNow Store. The store is our marketplace for applications and services developed on the ServiceNow platform. Together, these programs boost the availability of apps and services to help customers extend the value of ServiceNow across their organizations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, as part of Knowledge 15, we will be holding our annual financial analyst day on April 20. This event is highly recommended to ServiceNow followers and investors, and we look forward to seeing you there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will now turn the call over to Mike. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Frank. During today\u2019s call, we will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q2 and full year 2015. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release, filed earlier today, and, for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total revenues for the first quarter were $212 million, an increase of 52% year over year and 62% in constant currency. Subscription revenues for the quarter were $180 million, growing 53% year over year and professional services and other revenues were $32 million, growing 48% year over year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the beginning of 2015, we changed our customer count methodology. Previously, as defined in our SEC filings, we counted all production instances as separate customers, meaning some logos were counted as multiple customers if they had more than one instance in production. Under our new methodology, we count each logo once, regardless of the number of production instances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Although individual production instances are often separate sales cycles and sold by different sales reps, we feel that this new methodology is more intuitive and gives better insight into our business and key operating metrics. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This change in methodology impacts total customer count, upsell rate, revenues per customer, number of customers paying greater than $1 million in ACV, and average contract terms. Each of these metrics have been restated for historical periods and are available in our quarterly IR deck at investors.servicenow.com. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total customer count, excluding express customers, was 2,461 at the end of the first quarter under our new customer count methodology, and was 2,872 under our previous methodology. Our upsell rate was 32% for the quarter under our new customer count methodology and 25% under our previous methodology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total revenues per customer for the trailing four quarters were $345,000 under our new customer count methodology, an increase of 21% from the prior year. Our total revenues per customer for the trailing four quarters under our previous methodology was $298,000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now have 168 customers under our new customer count methodology that pay us more than $1 million in annualized contract value, up 75% from 96 in the same period last year, and up 10% from 153 in the previous quarter. Under our previous methodology, we have 143 customers that pay us more than $1 million in annualized contract value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells, and renewals were 29.7, 22.5, and 23.6 months, respectively, under our new customer count methodology and 29.6, 20.3, and 26.3 months, respectively, under our previous methodology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our annualized contract value per Global 2000 customer was $746,000 for the quarter, up 34% from the prior year and up 4% from the prior quarter. Total revenues based on geography were $149 million in North America, $48 million in EMEA, and $15 million in Asia Pacific and other, representing 70%, 23%, and 7% of total revenues, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our non-GAAP billings, calculated as revenue plus change in deferred revenue from the statement of cash flows, was $268 million in the quarter, increasing 48% year over year and 59% in constant currency. As a reminder, we price and invoice in local currencies. Approximately 30% of our first quarter billings were in foreign currencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our weighted average subscription billings term was 11.8 months for the first quarter, compared to 12 months in the first quarter of 2014. In the first quarter, subscription gross margin was 81%, compared to 76% in the prior year. Professional services and other gross margin was 9%, compared to 10% in the prior year. Overall, gross margin was 70% compared to 66% in the prior year. Operating margin was 3% compared to negative 5% in the prior year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the quarter with 3,047 total employees, an increase of 944 from the same period in the prior year and an increase of 221 from the prior quarter. Full details of our quarterly headcount adds by department are available in our quarterly IR presentation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net income for the first quarter was approximately $2 million or $0.02 per basic and $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $11 million, or negative $0.08 per basic and diluted share in the prior year. Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 152 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 166 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the first quarter, we generated $67 million in cash flow from operations and we used $27 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $40 million free cash flow. This compares to $13 million of free cash flow in the same period of the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the quarter with $999 million in cash, short term, and long term investments. Our total deferred revenue balance was $463 million at the end of the first quarter, up 10% over the $422 million reported at the end of the prior quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s turn to guidance for the second quarter and full year 2015, based on current FX rates. For the second quarter 2015, we expect total revenues between $237 million and $242 million, represented year over year growth between 42% and 45%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect subscription revenues between $192 million and $196 million and professional services and other revenues between $45 million and $46 million. Our professional services and other revenues outlook includes $11 million related to knowledge, with the related expenses of $23 million recorded in sales and marketing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect billings between $260 million and $265 million, representing year over year growth of 38% and 41%. We expect subscription margins of 80%; professional services and other gross margins, excluding knowledge, of 15%; and overall gross margins of approximately 70%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect an operating loss of approximately $5 million, including net expenses of $12 million related to our knowledge conference. We expect free cash flow of approximately $40 million. For the full year 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $970 million to $1 billion, representing year over year growth of between 42% and 47%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total annual revenue estimate consists of subscription revenues between $820 million and $840 million, and professional services and other revenues between $150 million and $160 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect approximately 5% operating margin for the year and to end the year with approximately $180 million fully diluted gross shares outstanding, which includes all basic shares, stock options, and RSUs outstanding before applying the Treasury stock method. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jennifer Lowe</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, the first question I had was for you. And in particular, I wanted to look at the billings calculation methodology a little bit. I think a lot of us in the past have been looking at it as a change in deferred off the balance sheet, and I think that was what was in guidance too. This time around, it looks like now you\u2019re switching to look at it on a cash flow basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So one, I just wanted to verify that\u2019s sort of how you\u2019re going to be thinking about it going forward, and two, can you talk a little bit about why you look at that as being a more appropriate way to calculate billings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter, FX really impacted us quite a bit, given the movement you saw. I think the euro was around 1.21 at the end of December. It\u2019s down to 1.08 now. And we saw a lot of movement. Remember, 30% of our billings are in foreign currencies as well. Our international operations, our functional currency is the euro, so that really impacts us quite a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as a result, we think it\u2019s more meaningful to factor in that FX, and you picked that up in the cash flow statement. And going forward, that is the way that we will do it. Historically, there wasn\u2019t that much of a difference between the two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jennifer Lowe </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then maybe just rolling that forward a little bit further, I know in the past, when you\u2019ve given the full year guidance, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about the assumption of FX headwinds on revenue. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what you think the FX impact is baked into the billings guidance for Q2, and then the full year revenue guidance?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We took down our internal plan for the balance of the year approximately an additional $6 million based upon just our backlog in deferred revenue for revenue. There\u2019s also, remember, a big chunk of our new business is in foreign currencies, and that\u2019s reflected as well in the guidance that we gave. But specifically, for backlog and deferred revenue, it was about another $6 million as of March 31 that we took out of our revenue plan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the billings, I don\u2019t have that exact number. That\u2019s based upon current FX rates today, the billings guidance that we\u2019re giving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, wondering, similar to Jennifer\u2019s question on the Q2, I guess one kind of rule of thumb I might use is that the currency impact for billings on Q1 would sort of roll into Q2, and you\u2019d see a similar impact in Q2. First of all, does that make sense?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If the FX rates stay where they are without moving such that our weighted average exchange rate and our balance sheet rate at June equals what it is at March 31, there\u2019ll be no impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019ll be impact on a year over year basis, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A year over year basis, but I mean in terms of the guidance that we\u2019re giving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Frank, for you, just on the app store and ISVs as a customer of your platform and so forth, can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about how important that app store is to getting ISVs onboard and generally how important ISVs are as you think about developing your platform as a revenue opportunity in the future?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They\u2019re very important, because we view the ISV strategy as a way to really increase the breadth and depth of our platform deployments in large enterprises all around the world. We\u2019ve been pretty good at really spreading our platform through the sale of our own applications and a lot of our partner activity and so on, but content is what drives platform adoption. We always say we\u2019re applications led, we\u2019re platform driven and enabled, so content is really, really key. One of the ways we really think we\u2019re going to unleash that torrent of content is through the ISV community. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the store is really a monetization feature. I think we have a very good routes to market for ISVs in terms of our conferences and our programs and so on, but they have to have the ability to get their content in front of our customer base and then be able to monetize it. In terms of revenue, yes, there is a revenue component in terms of selling through the store, but that is not principally how we\u2019re gonna get paid. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re gonna get paid on the platform licenses. Effectively, you can think of them as run times. Every time a third party piece of content is sold, that will trigger, in most situations, incremental platform licenses as well. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, I just wanted to come back to the currency question. You told us what the incremental was, but can you just be specific about what is the year over year revenue headwind total that you expect for Q2 and for the year that\u2019s baked into guidance? And then the way I calculate it for this current quarter, you came in maybe twice what I would have expected, so is there something that would have caused that to be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remember, going into Q1 guidance, we had already told people that we took our revenue down for FX. Cumulatively, from when we started planning in the end of Q3 2014, we\u2019ve taken out almost $40 million out of our 2015 plan because of FX. But that was based upon where the rates were back in September.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specifically, when we went into the Q1 call, at that time, the rate had already dropped to 1.12, and we had already lowered our guidance for 2015, partly on that. And as I just mentioned, we just took another $6 million out of our number for the balance of this year as a result. Specifically, FX associated with our backlog in deferred revenue we had. But there\u2019s an incremental piece based upon the new business that we plan on booking, because we quota people in local currencies as well, too, around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is it possible to just tell us what the revenue headwind is total year over year, not where you were, but versus - or where you were versus what the revenue headwind was?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year over year, it\u2019s going to be about $40 million, ballpark, which is conservative. I think it\u2019s actually a little bit higher than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, just for Q2 on the billings guide, is there anything else other than FX we should keep in mind in terms of the sequential Q1, Q2 guide down on billings? And I\u2019m just curious, just as it relates to the big deals, you were down year over year on the deals over a million. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s different this year in terms of how those deals are coming through? And I would assume the pipeline\u2019s pretty good for the large deals, but if you could give us a little more color that would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, as we\u2019ve told people before, these are very long sales cycles, and they tend to be lumpy. Our linearity in Q1, it was very back end loaded. There were a number of deals that slipped as we always have, that slip from one quarter to the next. And we\u2019re off to a fast start this quarter, but we like to see a little bit more into Q2 before we change our outlook going forward for the balance of the year. We\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we gave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kirk Materne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, just maybe a follow up back on Mike Turits question, just on the year over year hit from FX. If I think about it, obviously [$3] million is about 4% headwind. Obviously, this quarter is almost a 10% headwind on revenue. So is the assumption that the gap between recorded and constant currency should close over the course of the year, assuming that the euro doesn\u2019t get materially worse. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? So that we [wouldn\u2019t] see as big a gap between, say, reported revenue and reported billings in constant currency?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re still going to have constant currency headwinds when you do the comparison for future quarters, but our guidance that we\u2019re giving, if we don\u2019t see deterioration in the Europe, should be more in line. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kirk Materne </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just in terms of you guys obviously had an incredibly strong finish to the year. I know you mentioned the first quarter was a little bit more back end loaded seasonally. Did you guys get off to a slower start, or is it just as [indiscernible], it\u2019s just more you guys getting into longer, bigger deals, just the deals cycles extend and just have quarters that might be more back end weighted?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Mike said, we were off to a slow start, because we had sort of a hyperbolic Q4, which is great. But unfortunately, we hit January, you know, a lot of business gets pulled forward and it just takes time for the sales teams to build the pipeline back up, so it then starts pushing the business all the way to the back end of March as well as past it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had quite a bit of deal slip, but the good news is actually that literally when we turned the corner into April, that all started to close in rapid fashion. We\u2019ve already closed more than half in the first two weeks of April [of our push] and we expect to get most or all of it before this month is out. So we\u2019re not terribly concerned. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The quarterly patterns are sometimes difficult in our business, because our sales cycles are long. And it\u2019s much easier to sort of view things in six month increments, because it normalizes out, this kind of aberration. You know, our customers don\u2019t really care whether they do it in March or April. Obviously, our sales teams do, because that\u2019s how we incentivize them, but obviously, we can\u2019t get too excited about it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think that structurally, our business is very, very sound, but sometimes things bounce from this side of the line versus that side of the line. And our deals, we don\u2019t lose them, they don\u2019t go away. And we do close them. Sometimes, they just bounce outside of the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re feeling good about the way our business is developing, but we definitely saw quite a bit of friction in Q1. And it\u2019s kind of hard to know if it was because we were a little light on mature pipeline or if it was due to other factors. We\u2019re reading the tea leaves a little bit, looking at other companies, what they were experiencing. But on the whole, especially what we saw in April, we\u2019re feeling quite good about it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Greg Dunham from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Dunham </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess following just up on that, how would you characterize the pipeline today, looking towards the end of the year versus what it was a year ago?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually, feeling much better about it going into April versus going into January. Q1, as those of you that have followed us ever since the IPO, it\u2019s always a tough quarter, because Q4 is so strong. And that\u2019s just the nature of our business. But yeah, the June quarter is our historical Q4, when our fiscal year was June, so both the Q2 and Q4 have always been our strong seasonal quarters. So we\u2019re feeling good coming into this quarter as well as the back half of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Dunham </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Mike, just one more from me. I think what\u2019s a little confusing is the FX, the constant currency adjustment. You know, 30% of your billings and revenue are international. Even if I look at the euro, the depreciation was less than 20%, so I don\u2019t get how you get a 10 point headwind in the quarter, given 30% mix and given less than 20% move in the euro. Can you help walk through where the delta is? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All I know is the detailed calculation that we have to support that, and you can see that coming through the cash flow as well too, by doing the movement there. And the cash flow is at the average rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Dunham </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, we can follow up offline on that. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, it\u2019s the first quarter, where you kind of show up like a normal software company, and everyone is now kind of a bit confused. But I would say it\u2019s kind of quite okay to be normal. Just quick question, if you think about the change in momentum in Q1, is it really like plain vanilla, you had a massive Q4 and so the sales pipeline was a little bit empty, so [indiscernible] again, or did you do any changes in terms of kind of getting the [sales guys] kind of to run 10% faster or focus more on different deal sizes, or whatever? Or is it just really like, this is Q1, let\u2019s get on with it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I appreciate you asking that question, because we also had a fairly sizable sales realignment and reorg coming into the new year. That happens every year, but this particular year more than half our reps ended up with new account assignments. And what that does is it really dramatizes the effect that we already talked about, because people knew they were going to lose their accounts, so they\u2019re closing like there\u2019s no tomorrow, but they\u2019re also not building the pipeline, because they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re gonna get. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the lower you go into the organization, the more they will point to this particular dynamic as being very impactful to the Q1 dynamic. But it\u2019s sort of one time. The reality of our business is we go through a lot of sales reorgs, because the organization expands so rapidly. We have to subdivide territories and we\u2019ve really dramatically increased the focus on the commercial markets. So there were a lot of moving parts between December and January, and as a matter of fact, we were like a mature pipeline coming into the quarter. So that was an additional factor that was at play. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one follow up there, Frank. If you look at the normal sales org or reorg, it\u2019s kind of one quarter looks really ugly then the next quarter it kind of comes back together, and then you\u2019re back on track in Q3/Q4. Is that kind of the right way to think about it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it wasn\u2019t really ugly. This was still our third best quarter ever. I wouldn\u2019t consider that ugly at all. But I do think that the effect of the reorg is a one-quarter event. In that part, I\u2019m agreeing with you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, I\u2019ve got a product question on performance analytics. When we talk to customers and partners, it seems to be resonating as a killer app or feature. Is there a way to think about the ASP uplift of that product and maybe where you\u2019re seeing some adoption? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, our standard pricing for PA is 20% on our subscription per user fees. It is an important capability for us. Strategically, we\u2019re really moving performance analytics away from standard business intelligence data, warehousing approaches, where people forklift the data to another data structure and then do the reporting over there. We\u2019re really focusing that technology towards real time reporting. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think that\u2019s going to be super differentiated for us, because we are sitting on the data as it changes, and we\u2019re able to represent that in real time or near real time. It\u2019s going to become a very, very important part of our strategy going forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So performance analytics is a key component. We acquired that technology about a year and a half ago now, almost two years ago. We\u2019ve had good take up. But we\u2019re just in the beginning stages of really running this play. It\u2019s going to get much more significant going forward for our customers and the types of applications people are implementing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Hedberg </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe just a quick follow up. Maybe I missed it, but did you give the number of HR or facility wins in the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We didn\u2019t. One of the things that we did coming into the year is that we didn\u2019t change our pricing. We do have different SKUing now. We are now just selling one service management SKU, and regardless of whether it\u2019s IT, HR, or any other flavor of enterprise service domain, it\u2019s all the same price. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We don\u2019t have the same visibility on the number that is specific to HR or facilities, because our customers are buying them, and they want to have the ability to assign it to whatever department they\u2019re going to be using it for. So we don\u2019t know precisely how they\u2019re using it, whether that\u2019s HR or IT or any other flavor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think I talked about this in previous calls, but it\u2019s a very important part of how we go to market is to sell it as service management than not specific to IT or HR or any other flavor. We really want our customers to embrace service management for the enterprise, and then they can decide how to allocate it to different service domains. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I will tell you that HR continues to be a very robust, very, very high activity area for us, and that\u2019s going to continue. That\u2019s very exciting for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Ashley </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have just a quick question on the Express product. How quickly does that product deploy versus the flagship product? And maybe could you give us a general sense between the mix of larger companies and smaller companies that are adopting?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We sort of view Express as a days and weeks for order of magnitude versus weeks and months for what you\u2019d call the flagship product. That\u2019s really the enterprise product. And Express can really go in very, very quickly, because all you have to do is really populate your users and establish their credentials and you\u2019re off to the races. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s really no design process, workshop. All those concepts, they\u2019re not there. This product is supposed to be used out of the box, so the moment you define the system, everything is on, and you can start using it. That\u2019s why the product is called Express, because it\u2019s really an order of magnitude faster in terms of standing it up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The vast majority of Express users really obviously are smaller enterprises. There\u2019s some mobility between the enterprise products and Express. We\u2019ve seen customers go both directions, which is actually a really good dynamic for us, because we\u2019ve seen a bunch of them graduate to the bigger product. We\u2019ve also seen some of them fall out and needed to go to the smaller product. So we\u2019re really happy to have it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This may be a bit of an ignorant question, since I\u2019m relatively new to your stock, but it looks like there\u2019s a changing seasonality to your business. I\u2019m going back over the last three years. We just looked at the deferred revenue sequential increase in Q4. It has been getting better and better from 2012 to 2013, to 2014, particularly in 2014, although the current moved pretty severely against you. You had well north of 20% sequential growth there. That\u2019s like 400 or 500 basis points better than you have been in Q4 in other years. And consequently, it\u2019s only natural to expect some more seasonality going into Q1. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So is it really that? Of course, you don\u2019t share with us billings forecasts for the year, but as you look at your billings target for the year on a constant currency basis, are there any changes to your expectations, even within a range, albeit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll say that, as I mentioned before, it was a very back end loaded quarter, and a number of deals slipped into Q2, and we\u2019ve closed a number of those, as Frank mentioned. And so as a result, there\u2019s two things impacting that. There is the deals that got pushed, as well as the FX, which is impacting us. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But absolutely, our plan going into the quarter was to be a down quarter. You don\u2019t see it as much in billings, because we have a lot of contracts that we signed in Q4 that start January 1, which don\u2019t get reflected in our billings or deferred revenue but are in backlog going into Q1. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I definitely expect, as we get larger, we will be no different than any other software company. And you\u2019ll see the typical seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the dynamic you\u2019re talking about, I said earlier, we used to be a June quarter fiscal. And obviously, we changed that a couple of years ago. So that obviously means that Q4 is going to gradually become more prominent if you look at it from a historical standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m looking at 2012 to 2014. There\u2019s a clear trend where the sequential growth in your deferred revenue used to be 14% to 15% in 2012. Now this Q4 of 2014 was 20%, although the currency moved against you. So there\u2019s clearly a huge shift in your seasonality, it sounds like. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to dovetail into what you\u2019ve been saying, and I appreciate the detail you guys are giving, but maybe\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also had such a record Q4 where a lot of deals were pulled from Q1 into Q4 with guys closing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So no change with respect to your plan as a business for calendar 2015, I take it? Assuming currencies hypothetically did not change. So you would not have changed your real plans, is what you\u2019re saying, for the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Indiscernible]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, got it. Thanks. Wonderful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Maynard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could I ask maybe one thing, and I\u2019m sure you probably want another couple more billings questions on this call, but if you can indulge me for one second. Is there anything else going on, Mike, in terms of seeing some of the trends towards the add on sales just ended up getting billed later in the year. I think you guys [indiscernible] that out on Q2 last year, if I recall correctly. And I\u2019m just curious, is that trend sort of normalizing, or do you see that as you increase cross selling of additional products continuing to push more and more? And is that the seasonality effectively that you\u2019re talking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Once again, I think what\u2019s being reflected in Q1 in this seasonality you\u2019re seeing is that Q4 was such a big number. And our sales reps knew they were losing a number of accounts, getting redistributed. So they pulled in every single upsell and deal. That\u2019s really what happened, and there were a number of deals as well that pushed from Q1 into Q2, because of the linearity in our quarter, which we closed a number of those already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Maynard </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Frank, just a question for you. Your comment around HR case management, having a single service management SKU, I\u2019m just curious, from your standpoint, you guys have been talking about, I\u2019d say, a broadening out of the use cases. You called out marketing, obviously HR. How are you feeling about just sort of the broader applicability into other areas, even like in the external service and support, things like that, where it\u2019s not just the traditional internal help desk, IT [indiscernible]?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a central theme of our entire strategy, is to really drive service management to an enterprise product. It\u2019s also one of the reasons why we didn\u2019t want to segment our business in terms of all these domains, because there are tons of other service management applications that really don\u2019t sort of fit squarely on a functional department or function. It can just be a single service that\u2019s being provided. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one of the things that we\u2019ve also included - we\u2019re going to show that next week at our conference - is a template for customers to actually build their own customer service management applications. And it\u2019s so highly abstracted and templated that you can auto generate most of the service management applications, because there\u2019s just tons and tons of use cases out there, and we cannot support that all. We\u2019re just picking some of the big service domains out of there to prime the pump, because we know they\u2019re sizable and there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But there is lots and lots of use cases, which is why we went through this templated automation approach to sort of help people with the tooling to do that, with really no coding skills whatsoever, to be able to stand up those kind of services where you have case management, knowledge management, requests. You get cataloged and everything, where you stand that up automatically for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the whole notion of managing service is very, very broad based inside the enterprise. It\u2019s actually not limited to the categories that we\u2019ve mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick follow up, as it relates to what happened with the sales force, and I had a number of questions from investors who were asking to what degree are the changes this quarter similar to what you\u2019ve done in the past. And in terms of the changes that you made, are those now all settled in and you\u2019re set for the year? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re certainly set for the year, but it\u2019s very unlikely that we\u2019re set for years, because of the rate that our business grows. And at the rate that we\u2019re bringing on people, the service areas are getting denser and denser, meaning that the whole commercial market, we\u2019re much more aggressive in covering that now, whereas previously we were very much skewed and biased toward the very large enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, we have a whole organization dedicated to the commercial accounts, the non-large enterprise accounts. So as we said earlier, this is a very large reorg, and the net result of it was that a lot of people changed their account responsibilities. More than half of them, and that\u2019s just big. It creates a measure of discontinuity in the overall process of generating activity and building pipeline. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, is there a percent that you could put on, just ballpark, what percent of the sales force you actually changed this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, more than half ended up with new account assignments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In changes net new and overall, that would equate to\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, if you look at all the accounts that we had, 50% of those accounts had new sales people covering them, not necessarily new people we hired. But we reorganized and moved accounts around within both our existing sales people and new people that we hired.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, the effect of that is that when people know they\u2019re losing accounts, they\u2019re going to take whatever they can off the table. They\u2019ll leave nothing behind for the next guy. That\u2019s natural behavior, and obviously, then, once that happens, the new guys have to start all over again, because nothing was left behind. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when you do that, at the change of the fiscal year, it\u2019s exacerbated, because everybody\u2019s in the accelerators and they're putting everything and anything into it to make sure they maximize their yield on the investment that they\u2019ve made in prior months to develop that business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s the dynamic at play here. But as I said, it\u2019s a one-time thing. Some measure of that we have every year, because of the rapidly growing nature of our business, but this was very pronounced in this particular transition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So can you just roll that forward then? You would anticipate maybe a quarter or two for that to settle in before you feel that you\u2019re back to full capacity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we\u2019re past that now. Everybody\u2019s locked and loaded. And as I said, we feel much better about the way the pipeline has been developing coming into April versus coming into January, as you relate it to the numbers that we have to generate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba from Mizuho Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Abhey Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, not to beat a dead horse, just going back to the currency question for a minute, based on what you use for your guidance for the quarter, how much was the additional impact on Q1 revenues and billings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter revenues themselves were impacted by - it\u2019s actually, if you look at the December 31 rate, our revenues were down $2.7 million in the quarter as a result of where the rate ended up being. In terms of billings, we don\u2019t really try to forecast our billings based upon a forecast currency other than the rate it is when we give our guidance. And so I can\u2019t give you that number specifically, what you\u2019re asking for, on the billing side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The billings is based upon the timing of your invoicing to customers as well, too. And so that can skew quite a bit as well. If we had a lot more billings in the beginning of the quarter, before the rates fell, it would have been a higher number. And if they\u2019re skewed toward the end of the quarter, when the rates had fallen quite a bit, you\u2019d see a lower billing number. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Abhey Lamba </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And very quickly, the [deals] that slipped from the quarter, were they in any particular region or industry vertical, or have any brought a macro takeaway from those? Or was it all related to your sales force reorg? And a follow up to that is essentially what are you modeling for your close rate for the second quarter? I understand your pipeline is very strong, but what are you thinking of closing versus historical Q2?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the deal slip, that\u2019s really an immaturity of pipeline, right? Customers don\u2019t really care whether it\u2019s March or April. And we do not want to resort to unnatural acts to force these things to happen inside March, because it\u2019s going to cost us a lot of money. And as we proved to ourselves in the first two weeks of April, we\u2019ve already closed more than half of them and under normal conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s all fine, because our relationships with customers are 10, 15, 20 years, so a couple of weeks is not going to make a whole lot of difference. And we\u2019re really happy with the way that is going. And it\u2019s very much a function of how much mature pipeline we have coming into the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of your close rate, I don\u2019t have an answer for you on that question, because that\u2019s not something that we typically discuss on the call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The deals that kind of slipped, though, were both in North America and Europe, the ones that have subsequently closed, so there was no specific industry. They were kind of spread across a number. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What I will say about close rates is we have an exceptionally high close rate in general, but what happens to us, our biggest number one competition is always the push, because these are large transactions. It always depends on whether a customer has the resources and the priority in the organization to undertake it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That is often the driver, why a deal doesn\u2019t happen in the quarter, when a customer just isn\u2019t ready. We don\u2019t lose them to competition. The deals are not going away. But it\u2019s not atypical for us to see transactions not just move one quarter, but move two quarters and sometimes, even three quarters, because they have to be ready to engage on the overall deployment. And it\u2019s not a small commitment. These are really, really big rollouts and goal lines. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that really is the nature of our business. And then you add to that that the March-April dynamic is not super compelling compared to December-January, and this is how it plays out. We\u2019re actually kind of surprised how strong April started, because it was almost a complete reversal of sentiment from where we were in late March. So that was kind of a nice thing to see. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg McDowell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess first, for you Frank, since we\u2019re only three to four days away from the kickoff of your user conference, I was just hoping you could preview some of the main themes and messages you want to get across to the user base. And then Mike, I have a second question for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t know how I can do that in 30 seconds or less. We are going to record our keynote presentations. I really would encourage you to go and watch those, because we\u2019re really laying out our case for what\u2019s possible and what you should aspire to. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the biggest thing about ServiceNow, the platform affords an opportunity to really change the way people work, away from unstructured messaging approaches, which is really email and voice and so on, getting to systems, structured data, structured workflow type of approaches. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The opportunity is just immense there in terms of productivity. We really find that there is an incredible productivity frontier in large institutions and enterprises. The one thing we will also see is due next week, is the release of a research study that we\u2019ve undertaken that has attempted to quantify what the effect of that is in terms of time lost and time wasted in organizations. And it\u2019s of such an order of magnitude that we believe that CIOs and senior executives in general will give a high level of priority around dealing with this. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so much of the money always flows to the customer side of the organization, where we touch customers. On the inside, we tend to be generations behind in terms of the opportunity to automate and streamline and really achieve huge productivity gains. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s what the conference is about. There\u2019s going to be a lot of announcements. We\u2019re going to show a ton of new product in all our categories. In operations management, on the platform, as I mentioned, where we have the store. We have a brand new developer IDE coming out. And of course in service management, the financial management app, as I talked about in the prepared remarks. So there\u2019s a lot of product that\u2019s going to be released and previewed at the conference. But the mega theme is always around how service management is really changing the way people work in institutions and enterprises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg McDowell </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one quick follow up for you, Mike, is I think a question we\u2019re going to get a lot tomorrow is if all these slipped deals have already closed in Q2, or early in April, why does the Q2 billings imply such a slowdown on a constant currency basis? You grew billings 59% in constant currency in Q1, and I know on an as reported basis, you\u2019re guiding to 38% to 41%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But even assuming another 10 point currency headwind, we\u2019re talking about 48% to 51%, so it would seem like there would be the potential with some of these slipped deals already closing that there could be some acceleration on a constant currency basis, instead of the decel that you\u2019ve guided to. So I was just hoping you could expand a little bit on that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, remember, a lot of the billings that we give guidance for is coming out of what\u2019s in our contracted backlog today, as well as the renewal cycle that we have. With our customers, that\u2019s where the bulk of it comes versus new business. And so even if you have deals that push from one quarter to the next, that doesn\u2019t move the billings as much as our backlog billings and renewals. And the guidance we gave is based upon what\u2019s in our backlog of renewals. And it factors in those deals slipping into this quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair &amp; Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Furby</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, I wanted to go back to the reorg. You mentioned that more than half of the accounts saw more change in terms of assignments, but what did that look like a year ago in terms of the percentage? Was it 10%, 20%, 30%? Just trying to get a sense for the magnitude of how pronounced it was. And maybe you said this, but why was it so pronounced this year versus last year? And then Mike, I\u2019ve got a follow up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I really can\u2019t quantify what the difference is, because I just don\u2019t know. I just know that this was viewed by our sales organization as huge in terms of the effect that it had on sales activity development and so on. Why was it huge? It\u2019s a very profound reorganization in terms of us allocating resources much more deeply and much more broadly in places where they haven\u2019t been before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I said already, we have an entire commercial account organization now. A lot of people have been moved around. A lot of global account organization. Because we have added so many people, there is far fewer reps names than there were before. So we have narrowed their focus considerably. Whereas before they might have had 15, maybe they now have five, for example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So those are really, really big changes in an organization. It obviously has a good sized effect on activity development. We don\u2019t want to dwell on it either, because of the way sales people operate. That\u2019s going to take care of itself in fairly rapid order, because they\u2019ve got to eat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Furby </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Mike, the billings guidance, if rates would have frozen when you gave guidance in late January, would you have still beat your billings guidance for the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Furby </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And is there any change, when you look to Q2, in how you\u2019re approaching the guidance? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, it\u2019s the same approach that we established our guidance going into Q1. We\u2019re applying the same methodology. [indiscernible] the rate\u2019s in effect now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tim Klasell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick one here. As we look forward, do you plan, given the growth rates, that you will do the sales force reorg at the same magnitude next year and following year, so we should sort of plan in that sort of seasonality? Or was this year a little bit more exaggerated?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What was really new this year is at the end of 2014, we hired a new VP of commercial sales for the Americas, and this reorg is moving a number of those people directly underneath him, where in the past, all of that, the commercial and the enterprise, was rolling up under one person. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also, halfway through last year, we did hire a head of Americas enterprise sales. Both those two leaders report into our VP of worldwide sales. That\u2019s what created the big reorg that was telegraphed out to people that was going to be happening in January of 2015. And so I don\u2019t expect to have that big of an impact in future years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead from Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karl Keirstead</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple of cleanup questions. It looks like there was a little outperformance on the gross margin side relative to your guidance. Can you talk through that? And then also, it looked like capex as a percentage of revenue upticked a little bit. Maybe you could offer a little color there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, what helped in the subscription margin was the exchange rates, for one thing. And the other thing, just kind of delays in some expenses that we had within our data centers. Remember, one of the reasons why we bill in foreign currencies is we operate data centers around the world, and we have expenses in foreign currencies. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have a pretty good hedge in place there, but a lot of our data centers, where they were kind of some of our international data centers, are not even close to being at capacity. So when the FX rates do strengthen the U.S. dollar, you\u2019ll see improvements in our gross margins just due to some of those international data center costs coming down in U.S. dollars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And sorry, what was your second question you asked, Karl?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karl Keirstead </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just on the capex, the percentage of revenue looked like it upticked a little bit this past quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s really just timing of things happening. As we said, for the full year, we expect it to be roughly, I think we said, about 9% of revenues for the full year, is what we\u2019re expecting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Mike, when I look at the 59% constant currency billings, and I think you said it was 66% last quarter, that doesn\u2019t look like much of a hiccup. But it sounds like there\u2019s a difference between bookings and billings, and bookings growth was probably lower than billings. Is that the right assumption?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I haven\u2019t done the math to try to figure that out, and I\u2019m trying to understand your question more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, you didn\u2019t see much of a slowdown in billings growth versus Q4. But you know, you\u2019re talking about deal slippage, so I\u2019m just trying to put two and two together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But a lot of the billings that we have have nothing to do with our current bookings, because a lot of our billings, as I mentioned, come out of our backlog, which we booked already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Frank, as you gear up and are kind of getting more aggressive and moving outside of IT, and maybe this is alongside some of the changes you\u2019re making in the sales force, but are you doing anything different in the go-to-market approach where you look at maybe more specialist overlays or working with partners in a different way to really help move outside of IT?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the things we\u2019ve done in December is we changed our [product] organization away from a functional single product, single market approach to a product line model, where we really now have organizations that can move with multiple products against multiple markets at the same time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we now have you can call them BUs or product lines that now have product leaders on them. We really did that to be able to increase the focus on markets that otherwise would not get the quality of attention and focus and resources. And particularly, that\u2019s for things like IT operations management, a product like Express. They have their own resources. The platform now has its own organization. So all those teams are going to be developing their own go-to-market capabilities and really driving the sales organization across a much broader front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that was a substantial change in how we internally operate, but that will begin rippling out to the outside as well over time. This is just starting on the inside in how we work on a day to day basis. But then, it won\u2019t be long, because they are responsible for the go-to-market motions and all the marketing programs, all the partner strategies, etc., that are associated with these individual product lines. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is really a fairly substantial change, because it really broadens the approach for ServiceNow as a whole. Before, we were very much led by our service management product, because that\u2019s so dominant in the overall mix, and in order for us to make sure the other products are getting adequate resources, that\u2019s why we went to this model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Katherine Egbert with Piper Jaffray.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katherine Egbert</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to FX, if I can, is it just a direct FX impact, or are you seeing any areas where you price in U.S. dollars and maybe people are downsizing deal sizes because it\u2019s more expensive?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, as I said, in most international locations, we\u2019re pricing in local currencies. The major places where we play in are EMEA is euros and pounds. Australia is Australian dollars. Canada is Canadian dollars. In Singapore and others, it\u2019s principally in U.S. dollars, but the bulk of our business internationally is Europe and Australia would be number two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katherine Egbert </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just without giving any color on HR and facilities and some of the other areas, it makes your addressable market a little bit less clear. What can you tell us about that? Does your addressable market stay the same now that you have one SKU? How do we look at that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we view service management as really one market. That\u2019s sort of the net that you should take away from this. Certainly, we can size this marketplace by looking at how many HR people there are in the world, and we\u2019ve done that. And some of that you will find on our investor page, exactly how we arrived at that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But these are not structural changes. These are really positioning changes. Our customers are saying, look, I\u2019m adopting service management. I don\u2019t know how many people I will have in IT versus HR versus any other service domain. So for us to be able to buy one set of service management licenses and for us to be able to deploy them as our needs develop is much more attractive than having them segmented and fragmented into categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s why that happens. It really has no effect on our addressable market. It\u2019s just how we approach it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Katherine Egbert </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then one last quick one. The acquisition you made, did it add any review this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. That\u2019s really a professional service organization, and they came on with about $500,000 in backlog, but that\u2019s still to be performed. It was more getting the people, the domain expertise, for our product management, to further strengthen our GRC application.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Hindlian from Brean Capital. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sarah Hindlian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was hoping you could give us a little bit of an update in terms of what you\u2019re seeing right now in terms of [ITOM] adoption. I know you discussed last quarter seeing about 10% of the business coming from that market, which is still largely unsupported by the sales force. And then two, I\u2019m hoping - and not to beat a dead horse either, but I\u2019m trying to understand the guidance in terms of seeing half of these deals close that were slipped and the assumption of a consistent FX rate from this point on. I\u2019m hoping you could give a little bit of color in terms of the conservativism around this outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the ITOM, we\u2019re seeing roughly about 10% of our business is ITOM that we\u2019re seeing, and that was consistent with what we were seeing in Q4. In terms of our guidance, our guidance is based upon, as I mentioned before, there is the FX headwind on our existing backlog, but 30% of our business is denominated in foreign currencies. And so our pipeline of opportunities and what our plan was for new business this year is coming down as well, because of the FX associated with that. And the guidance we\u2019ve given is based upon kind of where we\u2019re seeing things right now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re a little bit cautious with how we saw Q1, the linearity. Yes, we\u2019re off to a strong start right now, but we\u2019d like to see a little bit more of that. What I will say is this is the strongest start we\u2019ve ever seen at the beginning of a quarter. But does that mean that\u2019s going to continue throughout the rest of the quarter? We\u2019re going to take a wait and see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was wondering, with the sales reorg, is there any change in focus between focusing on new accounts versus kind of existing opportunity, considering you\u2019ve broadened the product set so much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve had that orientation since the beginning of 2013. You\u2019ve been with us that long. That\u2019s when we introduced the separation that we have between existing accounts and new accounts. And we have carried that theme through in this new organization, the model. So both from the commercial side and on the enterprise side, there is the delineation between people that take care of existing accounts and the people that are hunting for new logos. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is now the third year into it that we are organized that way. It\u2019s really important for a SaaS company, because we rely so heavily on renewals and upsells. So that\u2019s how we are, and that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been, and that\u2019s certainly what we will be going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know, SaaS companies will become increasingly dependent over time on existing customers. That\u2019s just the nature of the way the model eventually works. So we\u2019re really well set up to be able to run that the way we\u2019re currently organized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Mike, can you just talk a little bit about what drove the upside to cash flow in the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, we had some really, really strong collections in the quarter. We had a number of customers who paid us earlier than we were expecting. That\u2019s one of the things that we noticed. I was surprised at some of the large payments that came in in sub-30 days. Still annual. There was nothing because of multiple year payments, but I can give you one example of one customer that should have paid us in April on 30 days. It was two point something million. I was shocked they paid us in March, within 22 days or something like that of the contract. So it\u2019s just the timing of cash collections is the biggest driver that we saw.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Are you guys seeing any more evidence of leading with applications outside of IT and HR, in finance and facilities this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s part of our go-to-market thrust, so our organization is directed and instrumented to campaign our platform, not just in IT. Obviously, we\u2019re going after IT, but there\u2019s many situations where IT, for whatever reason, is not up for grabs. It could be contractual, for whatever reason. So it\u2019s really great that we can go after a human resources department or sometimes just pure platform applications. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we don\u2019t easily strike out. If we can\u2019t go through the front door, we go in through a side door. We have many arrows in the quiver, many clubs in the bag, so to speak, to pursue business. And certainly our sales people like that a lot. We don\u2019t easily strike out. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I actually want to focus on the business here, on the new customer acquisition, from some of the newer applications. Last quarter, you gave some color of some wins outside of your traditional IT customers, folks that weren\u2019t using the IT [indiscernible] product. Wondering if you could give some color on that, what you saw this quarter, what the pipeline looks like for the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That information is all anecdotal for the reasons that I mentioned earlier, which is now we\u2019re just selling one service management SKU, and we let our customers decide how they use them. And over time, they actually move them around between one service domain, like IT, to another service domain, like facilities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The downside of that, of course, is that we don\u2019t have precise data anymore, whether the uptake is one discipline or another. But the anecdotal evidence is very, very strong, that the uptake in HR is very, very good. And the thing about human resources, we\u2019re not just getting involved in the HR on the service management side either. We\u2019re involved in compensation planning applications, we\u2019re involved in onboarding/offboarding applications. Actually going to show some of that with one of our partners at the conference next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So HR\u2019s become a whole domain of service management applications, not just the traditional case management, knowledge management, request management, which is what people most associate with what we do. So these areas are getting much more deeper, much broader, than they historically have been understood.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The same thing is true in facilities areas as well. There\u2019s capital request planning, there\u2019s not just all the usual request oriented type of applications. So the nice thing about getting time in market for these apps is that we\u2019re getting past the standard service management capabilities into a lot of other interesting areas. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s just how our business develops. People start understanding what the platform can do for them, and then the new services are being discovered, that are interesting to be stood up on our platform. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just obviously building on some of the anecdotal side, because obviously you guys do have that single SKU now, but when you think about sort of the near and the long term, just the end user side here, especially kind of the newer user bases that you\u2019re going after - you\u2019ve obviously talked about HR, field service, facilities management, GRC, you even made an acquisition in GRC - which do you think is a bigger near term opportunity that can drive revenue for you faster versus what\u2019s the bigger, longer term market for you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think that the IT operations management, especially under the influence of our Service Watch product, which we acquired last summer, I think it\u2019s a super important product. There is a ton of interest in the product. There\u2019s a lot of proof of value kind of steps going on. So we\u2019re very excited about that, because it\u2019s the tip of the spear, if you will, for our entire operations management strategy, and it just leverages the services management side absolutely perfectly. So we see that as an important area for us. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Service management is such a big area. We got started in IT. Obviously, everybody understands that part of our business. Then we\u2019re getting into adjacent service domains, sometimes referred to as business services. But increasingly, we\u2019re getting involved into, with services now, that actually run the business not just support the business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I mentioned this in the prepared remarks as well. Next week at conference, we have somebody speaking on how they\u2019re running an admissions process inside a university, which is really more like a CRM application. And in other words, a lot of the boundaries that we\u2019ve traditionally seen between CRM applications and service management applications are becoming much fuzzier. And we\u2019re now involved in take offs against SalesForce and Oracle, and companies like that. Well, you never saw that a few short years ago. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s all very existing for us, and that\u2019s why I mentioned the product line reorganization we did last December, because our organizations are really getting in position to drive us down those paths. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And at this time, there are no additional questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call and the broadcast of our financial analyst day will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our website.
