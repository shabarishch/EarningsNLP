Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today\u2019s call. With the close of fiscal 2015 ServiceNow became the second enterprise SaaS company in history to report more than $1 billion in annual revenue. This milestone was driven by solid execution across the board; total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 44% year-on-year to $286 million and we continue to see strong demands from our customer base with a 99% renewal rate and a 39% upsell rate. The fourth quarter set the record for net new ACV. We now have 230 customers with ACV in excess of $1 million a net increase of 24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally we have 638 Global 2000 customers a net increase of 26. New Global 2000 logos include Michelin and Hirschi Company our average ACV per Global 2000 customer was $868,000 a 6% sequential increase. At the beginning of 2015 we restructured our sales effort to increase focus on the commercial market. As a result we grew our commercial business 48% in the quarter in addition to robust growth the commercial sales team also booked multiple transactions in excess of $1 million throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total addressable market continues to expand and is now estimated to add $60 billion with our latest software release in December known as Geneva we launched two major new services that expand or scope into service management market, customer service and security operations adding more than an estimated $13 billion to our addressable market. Our customer service offering provides a holistic approach that integrates customer engagement with the underlying engineering and operational processes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We already signed five deals for customer service including Pfizer the leading global provider of financial services technology. In addition we signed four customers for security operations including Raymond James Financial, a leading diversified financial services company. This new offering connects security events for market leading technologies with our advance work capabilities. A key value proposition is the institution of a shared workflow between IT and security teams. Our focus is not on detecting, but on processing security incidents in a highly structured experience and transparent fashion. This has been surely missing in the battle for cyber security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In 2016 our focus on helping customers, to transform their businesses using a service centric approach is intensifying, in this vision everything becomes defined and operated as a service and every enterprise will increasingly manifest itself as a software cloud. To help customers achieve this outcome we stood up and lead consulting team to map out their journey. This new team, which we call Inspire is currently working with a large customer to develop a long-term strategy around the industrial internet of things. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This customer plans to roll out a range of internal and external phasing cloud services that will more than triple our segment revenue by 2020. This is an existing customer, but this new engagement change the scope from an operational discussion to a strategic one. Another customer was in the midst of a corporate transformation along with the integration of a major acquisition instead of focusing just on an ITSM rip and replace the Inspire team showed them how IT could support the company\u2019s long-term transformation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result we worked alongside to customers, stakeholders to build the strategy, roadmap and architecture for IT and a new business process service center that roadmap will have us replace seven systems in total starting with IT and moving throughout the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally I look forward to seeing you all at the Knowledge \u201816 the week of May 16th in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. With that I will now turn the call back over to Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Frank. During today\u2019s call we will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for Q1 and full year 2016. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to not as a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today and for prior quarter\u2019s previously filed press releases, all of which are posted at investors.servicenow.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total revenues for the fourth quarter were $286 million, increasing 44% year-over-year and 51% in constant currency, a negative impact of $13 million.

Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was $160 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was $171 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the fourth quarter we generated $105 million in cash flow from operations and we used $25 million for capital expenditures resulting in $80 million in free cash flow. This compares to $39 million of free cash flow in the prior year. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, short-term and long-term investments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s turn guidance for the first quarter and full year 2016 based on FX rates as of the end of Q4. For the first quarter of 2016 we expect total revenues between $298 million and $303 million, representing year-over-year growth between 41% and 43% and between 42% and 44% in constant currency a negative impact of $2 million. We expect subscription revenues between $261 million and $265 million and professional services and other revenues between $37 million and $38 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a reminder, we are increasingly focused on deploying our internal professional services organization as a strategic resource and relying on our partnered ecosystem for service delivery. We expect billings between $360 million and $365 million, representing year-over-year growth between 34% and 36% and between 36% and 38% in constant currency, a negative impact of $3 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect subscription gross margin of approximately 83%, professional services and other gross margin of approximately 9% and overall gross margin of approximately 73%.

As a reminder, our financial forecast include anticipated attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses for our outstanding litigations with BMC and HP Enterprises, but not any forecast related to their outcomes. The trials are currency scheduled for March 2016 and May 2017 respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before closing, please note our Financial Analyst Day will be held in conjunction with Knowledge \u201816 on Monday May 16th in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay.

Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Very strong margins, but a little light relative to the billings guide granted with a little bit where FX headwind, anything that happened similar to last year in terms of restructuring around the sales force? And then I have a follow-up question, just a housekeeping question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Michael. This is Frank. We don\u2019t have any restructurings planned for this year. So the realignment that you saw last year on to commercial organization, which by the way we highlighted in our prepared remarks, has really worked out excellent for our business. We\u2019re not planning on doing anything like that coming into 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Mike, anything further on that relative to the billings at the low-end of the guide, granted a little bit more FX headwind?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, there is a number of things that go into billing that are both positive and negative when you\u2019re doing the forecasting. But I will say that there was an error in our forecasting. And if that error did not occur, we would have ended within -- we would have landed within the midpoint of our range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then I just have a housekeeping question. Can you let us know what your expectations are for the non-GAAP tax rate for 1Q \u201816 and 2016?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Q1 and all of \u201816, we\u2019re anticipating that it\u2019s going to be somewhere around 35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Turits</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Mike, just not to dwell on the billing, but just related to the error that you just mentioned, what was that? And also can you just talk a little bit about how you\u2019re factoring in the macro condition for how you look at the billings guide? I think everything is obviously obsessed with that metric. Was there any more conservative view that you put into that or are you not seeing the macro at all show up in the pipeline in terms of the forecast that you gave to the street?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The error had to do with looking at the system for what was our renewal opportunity that we had. And it was clearly an error that we captured and identified on December 15th. So, once again, if we had known that, we would have guided lower, and we would have ended within the midpoint of that the guidance we would have given. And I\u2019ll just say, our guidance is based upon where we see the business for 2016 right now, and we\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we\u2019re giving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So no extra macro cushion that you\u2019ve factored in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Frank, Brent. I mean, we\u2019re not really seeing any macro effect yet. I mean, we\u2019re such a secular business. We know, we have not really felt any effects up to this point, nor can we see it sort of down the road that is affecting our business. So that\u2019s not in our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Just one more clarification, sales headcount accrued total headcount in this last year, do you anticipate your 1,000 net adds with the growth rate in sales hiring out -- continue to outpace the rest of the headcount? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So we added roughly 405 people into the sales and marketing organization in all of 2015. And we expect in 2016 we\u2019re going to add about that same absolute number give or take depending on the quality of people we find.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for the clarification. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Eric Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for taking the question. Two questions, one on the top-line and one on the bottom-line. On the top line, if we look at your guidance for the full year, particularly the billing guidance, you guys have very good sustainability of growth throughout the full year stating mid to low 30s throughout the full year, which isn\u2019t too much different from what you\u2019ve done in the most recent quarter on a constant currency basis. What gives you confidence in the sustainability of that growth what you\u2019re seeing in your pipeline in terms of the opportunity that could help you sustain that high level of growth despite the fact you guys are coming to a pretty big scale as you\u2019re at over a $1 billion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the bottom-line, really nice free cash flows in this quarter. Anything one time in nature or anything we should keep in mind in terms of forecasting cash flows on a going forward basis that might need to be caught up at some point or do you think these sort of cash flow margin improvements are durable on a go forward basis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I will answer the cash flow first, Keith. So you are going to get some variability in cash flow on a quarter-to-quarter basis and the two quarters where we\u2019re going to generally have our lower cash flow is going to be Q1 and Q2. And a lot of that has to do around our Q1 and Q3 and that has to do with our ESPP plan and the way that that gets funded. And you can see that on the cash flow statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we feel pretty good about showing some more leverage in our cash flow this year and hence why we\u2019re guiding to 24% for the full year. There is nothing big that\u2019s going to happen there. CapEx as a percent of revenue is going to be somewhere in the slightly down from last year I think we are about 9.5%, 9.4% in 2015. I\u2019m expecting it\u2019s going to be somewhere around 8%, 8.5% in 2016. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in terms of your other question and in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in our pipeline and I will let Frank talk what gives us the confidence there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, the confidence comes from the fact that we now have quite a few years of operating history under our belts. So we have seen those patterns are very persistent in terms of the way our renewals are working the way, our upsells are working the way we land new logos for averaged deal sizes the whole cohort analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, when you take all of that into account, we really have quite strong visibility in how the business plays out from one quarter to the next, and it\u2019s a nice thing about a SaaS business where you have also big backlogs and deferred [ph] that it\u2019s really rock solid that way. We really don\u2019t depend on one quarter or another being an outlier either to the positive or the negative. So it\u2019s really a function of our history in the business and the persistence of the patterns that we\u2019ve been able to observe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Eric Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thank you, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, guys. I guess I am wondering into year and I know there\u2019s always some deals that move in and out of a quarter but was there anything abnormal guys this quarter in terms of large deals that may have slipped into 2016?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. There are always deals that slip from one quarter to the other. Likewise, you are always pulling deals in. I will say like most Q4s it was a very backend loaded quarter. But as Frank mentioned, we had record net new ACV in Q4 and we\u2019re very pleased with what we saw.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then in terms of the full year guide, services revenue I think was about $30 million light of consensus in our number. And obviously you\u2019re having some success this quarter. Is that accelerating to the SI channels and is that something we should continue to bake into our model longer term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s definitely something you should bake into your model as we\u2019ve been saying for a while. The SIs are becoming more important to us for doing service delivery, and we don\u2019t want to be seen as competing with the SIs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned, we\u2019re trying to make our own internal PS resources kind of more strategic and we would like the kind of the basic implementation work to be done more and more by our partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And hey, that\u2019s why the guys like CSV bought Fruition and Accenture bought Cloud Sherpas and we\u2019re going to let those guys continue to grow their businesses. We\u2019re more interested in the long-term subscription revenue from our customers. We just need to make sure that our partners are doing a good job of standing up our customers and want to really focus on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe a just quick follow-up to that. With this offloading to the SIs, is there anecdotal evidence that you are seeing an acceleration in that SI business due to the Cloud Sherpas or Fruition or things of that nature?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, this is Frank. There is an acceleration. Our SI business used to be opportunistic. In other words you know, when the opportunities presented itself they would bid on these opportunities, but it\u2019s different now. Because these organizations, they have bought companies, they have made investments and they now have real plans around to service in our business and to driving it to target. So they are much more disciplined, they are much more methodical, much more goal driven in the way they go about pursuing the ServiceNow business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s very, very different from the way it was in years past. As Mike said, we really want to make a room for them, make sure that we enable them. They also play a strategic role with our customers. And that\u2019s really important. We want our customers to have really a broad variety of choices and often times, we partner with these SIs as well. In other words, we will sub them or sometimes they sub us.

Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Mike I just wanted to dive into the question or the statement you made in the release and just mentioned on new ACV being at record levels, which I guess we would expect given that to Q4 you are a growing company. I am wondering, if I look at deferred commissions on the cash flow statement looks like the cash impact of that was roughly flattish year-over-year and your billings, I think we thought with forecasting but your billings you definitely benefited from the 99% renewal rate and I think is an all-time high for your company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So just wondering how we kind of quantify the new ACV and it grew but did it grow at the rates that it grown earlier in the year because it seems like maybe a slowed down a bit there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I guess, the first thing Walter is, we don\u2019t disclose the actual net new ACV but you can see in looking at our deferred revenue and backlog that we just signed, you can see the gross increase in backlog and deferred revenue. And doing an apples-to-apples comparison of 2014, deferred commissions to 2016 is not -- or 2015 is not an apples-to-apples because the 2015 comp plan was not nearly as rich as the 2014 comp plan. I will say in our guidance going forward for 2016 we\u2019re making our comp plan a little bit richer next year. And that it all depends I would say in 2014 we had a lot more -- we had a lot of reps who really, really blew their number away with acceleration. This year we had guys into acceleration, but they weren\u2019t blowing the numbers away as much in acceleration. So you didn\u2019t have as much as bigger commission payments being paid out, but net-net, our net new ACV was up quite nicely year-over-year quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And just a quick clarification on what Matt asked on the impact of services. I guess if we look at the delta between where you guided [indiscernible] of revenue and sort of where we were at, I am wondering, is the delta -- the impact on the lower [indiscernible] billing the same in other words the impact, that 1.6 number just trying to get a sense as to how the services may have impacted that number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the services is pretty much any services revenue that is recognized flows through immediately into billing. There is nothing upfront with that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Just want to make sure, that still the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ted Lin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. This is actually Ted Lin on behalf of Kirk. Just wanted to ask, can you guys talk about, whether you saw any extension of deal cycles or if you saw the initial size of deals change over the course of the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, really didn\u2019t see anything different in terms of deal cycle and deal sizes was pretty consistent from what we\u2019ve seen in the past. We had about 10 deals that were north of $1 million and that\u2019s been pretty consistent in that range. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ted Lin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks. Just a quick follow-up. Can you talk about any sort of momentum trends that you are saying with respect to your app store?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Frank. That continues to grow quite nicely quarter-to-quarter. I don\u2019t have the numbers right off the top of my head. But the number of apps that have been contributed to the store number, number of downloads, all those metrics, they move sequentially quite a bit. So I think there is about 140, 150 applications up on the store now. And it\u2019s going to be quite active. So good progress there since we introduced it in the summer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ted Lin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just two quick ones. Maybe one for Mike first. Was there anything that you were disappointed by in the quarter? I mean if I look at the net new customer adds in 4Q versus 3Q they were down a little bit, 176 to 174, if I look at Global 2000 adds, they were also down sequentially a little bit, and obviously deferred revenue sequentially the growth was a little weaker than last two years. Is there anything at all that you were disappointed by outside of kind of the error around billings guidance?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Really, just the error in the billings that, and I take full responsibility for that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, got it. And then, Frank, maybe just a question about product. One, we\u2019ve heard a lot about verticalization in the industry, particularly from sales force mostly, but as you look at the global SI channel and how ordinate certain verticals are for you guys, can you talk at all about the strategy around verticalization either from a product perspective or from a go-to-market perspective in 2016?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. So you\u2019re correct that the ADSIs of course have a very strong verticalized go-to-market motion, we\u2019ve not had that. The changes that we introduced during 2015 is that we went to a business unit structure. ServiceNow used to be single product, single market, mostly single channel type company. Last year that all changed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve broken our whole organization into business units. They\u2019re not verticalized, were organized by product. And we\u2019re seeing the effects of that quite dramatically, because the merchant products have taken off very, very strongly over the year. The business mix is changing very, very rapidly for ServiceNow, because these new products are taken off with a lot of momentum and that is impart because of the organizational structure and the resources that are behind it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re executing in that mode right now. And I\u2019m certainly not excluding the possibility that we will have a vertical vector to our go-to-market motion as well. But we\u2019re still in the middle of going through the transition to product which is working out really, really well for us, really, really happy with the progress we made in 2015, because that was really a big transition for the company to execute in that mode.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I did talk about customer service. That\u2019s certainly something that initially is going to get really focused on technology type businesses, because we have very, very strong fit with the product there, but in the forms of time I think that will take a vertical focus as well, because that business is very different from one vertical to the next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then, maybe on competition, as you go -- as you look at and as you launch customer service and the adjacencies between you and Salesforce grow, what -- how often do you see Salesforce and deals, what\u2019s that competitive framework look like going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we see Salesforce in a number of places. Obviously, we feel we\u2019ve had sort of a borders skirmish around a product that they call RemedyForce, which is really a product by BMC that Salesforce also markets, that\u2019s based on the Force platform. That\u2019s not been a big competitive factor between us and Salesforce. Where we\u2019ve seen that more is in platform opportunities where customers are standing up, custom applications and they\u2019re trying to figure out whether they going to do it Force, or they\u2019re going to do it on ServiceNow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What I will tell you is that with our entry into customer service management, that\u2019s a head on collision with service cloud. And I said in the prepared remarks we\u2019ve done five or six major transactions already, and most of them were contentious with Salesforce and there is just no hiding from that reality. So it\u2019s going to become more intense between us and Salesforce as we get further into 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, thanks guys. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Abhay Lamba of Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks. This is Parthiv [ph] standing in for Abhay. Are you seeing customers implement the Geneva release for any new used cases, and any color on the possible effects of the release on ACVs would be very helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Geneva just came out in December. So all new projects will be -- that have gone live since that time they\u2019re going live hopefully most of them will be on Geneva. Typically our customer base just gear quite rapidly and in terms of new applications in Geneva; the two that I mentioned, security management there is a huge amount of interest in that new product, because it\u2019s such a no brainer to layer that on to the platform strategy that our customers have with ServiceNow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then the other one that\u2019s a little bit further afield positioning wise around customer service. And we were quite sort of surprised how rapidly that took off as well because that\u2019s a different sales motion for us traditionally than selling to a core IT. But IT has always been a conduit and something that we can leverage very strongly to get into these new used cases. But we have very high expectations to continue on selling a lot of operations management, software applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This was very strong in 2015, it will be very strong in 2016, and we have great expectations of these new services with Geneva in 2016 as well. We just had our global sales kickoff in Orlando last week and they were introduced to our sales organization for the first time. So there is a lot of energy brewing behind those initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. Two quick questions. Frank, you talked about IT ops there in your last answer, can you talk a little bit about how do you see that evolving in 2016 with Geneva in terms of like how meaningful will that be for you guys? Is it just a first step for customers to go in there, or do you think that\u2019s going to be already meaningful? And then I have one follow-up for Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, IT operations management anything last I think year went from 10% to 12% of our business, and it\u2019s not easy to do to grow your share of the pie considering that the whole pie is still growing at a blistering rate as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">IT operations management is an ideal add-on opportunity for our sales organization. It\u2019s just a natural leverage of the core platform. We\u2019re only, for example, with service watch, which is probably that we acquired about a year and a half ago, we just got down in the Geneva release with completely re-platforming that acquisition. That means that it runs on our cloud, it\u2019s re-implemented in our platform, our UI framework, it is a completely native ServiceNow service you can\u2019t really tell that that was acquired or that has origins from another company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We only have penetrated 5% of our customers with our product so far. And it\u2019s a red hot product, so there is enormous upside for us not just sell that, but it leverages everything else it\u2019s used by our security product, it\u2019s used in event management applications. So, operations management is -- there is an enormous amount of runway for us there, and we\u2019re going to be building other assets and potentially acquiring assets in that area as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, perfect. Interesting. And then a question for Mike. Mike, if you keep the hiring on sales and marketing constant, in a way, that kind of means is a less productivity for the existing guys keeps going higher. That basically means you have a guide path going down. What\u2019s the puts and takes on your plan for 2016 to kind of say or keep it constant because it\u2019s difficult to find new people versus I need to increase it if I want to keep the growth rate higher for longer? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the driving factor behind adding roughly 400-plus people into our sales and marketing organization in \u201816 is we still truly do believe we\u2019re a more market constrained or, I mean, distribution constrained than market. There is still a lot of markets, especially in Asia Pacific where we\u2019re just starting to go into China and some of the other emerging markets in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And South America we actually had a very good quarter in South America last quarter, and we have high hopes. Remember, this is a long sales cycle. So it\u2019s going to take a year when we hire these people to really see were we able to get these people productive. And based upon the opportunity we see, we think that\u2019s the right number to continue to add people at that pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. So the acceleration can only kind of like a lot of these are in the greenfield markets where you have to kind of see the market and go to market and then you could do something more. Is that the right way to think about it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s part of it. But remember, we are as well continuing to split territories in North America and EMEA because we\u2019re not saturated with salespeople. Listen, we still don\u2019t even have 50% of the Global 2000 in North America because a lot of those that still aren\u2019t covered yet. We need to have more people.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Perfect. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karl Keirstead</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. One for Mike and one for Frank. Mike, just to be clear and I think it\u2019s a question that Walter was trying to drive at a little bit earlier. If you look at your billings guidance for 2016 of 33% to 34% in constant currency, is there any way for you to sort of quantify what the slower growth in services and narrowing your services focus is having on that constant currency growth and if you would encourage the street as a result to focus a little bit more on subscription billings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, for Frank, I\u2019ll just throw it in now. Investor interest in AWS, Asher [ph] and the public cloud shift is very high. It\u2019s probably very early for you guys. But I\u2019m curious, among ServiceNow\u2019s customers that are making that journey, have you seen any impact and are there any ITOM or other tools that could actually see a demand as customers move workloads? Thank you, both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I guess, Karl, I\u2019ll answer first. The bulk of our billings comes from subscription, not from professional services. If you look at where our professional service guide in revenue, that is pretty much dollar for dollar what our total billings is going to be for subscription -- for professional services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, when you look at the balance, which is left there, which is the bulk of the $1.6 million the subscription, most of that is actually coming out of billing, our contracted backlog, then renewals and then new business. And our guidance is the $1.6 billion, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Karl it's Frank. Your question about public hybrid cloud. We actually think that that trend is very beneficial to ServiceNow. And the reason is we have never really focused on managing deep infrastructure. That\u2019s more been the legacy focus of companies like BMC and HP and IBM and CA. What we\u2019ve always done, we\u2019ve always focused on the service orientation, understanding the operational characteristics and availability performance of the services. That is just as important, actually it\u2019s even more important in a public cloud type of environment because customers will be deploying and redeploying constantly between these different platforms and understanding what services are affected by what cloud is what we do, and that\u2019s going to be really important.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Secondly, I will tell you that our focus on service integration which really means is that we can really create a single service experience for all these different cloud resources, of the requesting of these resources or the provisioning of these resources, that\u2019s becoming an intense focus of our business as well. We are the company to provide that service integration infrastructure for the public cloud. So these are things that are going to help and fuel our business as opposed to become an impediment to our business because we\u2019re really not focused on deep infrastructure. That\u2019s been -- that\u2019s where the legacy companies have been, that\u2019s not where ServiceNow has been or where we are going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karl Keirstead</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great color. Thank you both. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Mike Kasaro [ph] with Pacific Crest. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Owens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Hi, guys. Rob Owens with Pac Crest. Couple of questions around the ITOM the opportunity. You mentioned about a 5% penetration rate at this point. Can you help me understand just with those customers what is done to ACV overall, I think 2016 was pointed to as kind of a critical year in inflection point for ServiceWatch, what metrics should we expect to see out of that portion of the business? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the only new thing that we\u2019re going to start to disclose with our K which is going to get filed as we\u2019ve told people as now we are -- we started tracking ITOM revenue separately because it is license different than the rest of our products is done on a per device or person script basis. And so for 2015 ITOM revenue was 8% of our total subscription revenue and for the quarter it was actually 8.2% for Q4. And so that\u2019s the one new metric that you\u2019re going to start to see, and you will see that in our quarterly numbers as we go forward for 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Owens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if we think about that from a bigger picture, what\u2019s it typically add to a customer that\u2019s taking it in terms of ACV? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, it depends upon the -- it depends upon the customer\u2019s environment. We have some customers that have almost doubled their ACV. We have others that are and these are we have a number of million dollar plus deals and it\u2019s really ServiceWatch has been a key piece of that, but it\u2019s not just ServiceWatch there is other things as well too. We have another customer who is paying us over about $6 million and almost two thirds of that is ITOM. So it depends upon the customer. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Owens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the color, Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Frank. Rob I mean, we believe that the ITOM business from a revenue standpoint booking standpoint is easily equivalent to what we have had in service management and overtime will be bigger than that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Owens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Frank. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You bet. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities.

Just one question for you Mike. We only get that backlog number once a year or so I wanted to drill a little bit into that for the full year up 40% constant currency. And I just want to ask, I mean there has been a pretty close historical relationship between the backlog and deferred and next year\u2019s revenue, and it does suggest again that it could be -- your 2016 revenue could be higher than your guidance you just provided. So I was just wondering is there anything different about the components of backlog this year than previous years, and maybe how FX is impacting what\u2019s in backlog? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as we did mention that our backlog, our reported backlog, as of December 31st is $65 million year-over-year just because of FX is down, and once again, our guidance, we\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we gave for both our billings and revenue for 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg McDowell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby, William Blair &amp; Company.

I might have missed this, but can you call out in terms of new ACV in Q4 what that was and what it grew year-on-year and just curious when you think about fiscal \u201816 in your billings guidance, and the different areas of potential upside, what you think maybe is the biggest opportunity whether it\u2019s platform, ITOM certain geographies, different package apps, just anything that may surprise you to the upside and then I got a follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think ITOM for the full year, I think, grew around 66%, somewhere around there. So that\u2019s that number. As I said earlier, I have huge expectations of our efforts. We\u2019re doing very large transactions in this area. I think the market for ITOM is bigger, will be bigger than four IT service management and the combination of these products especially with the way we\u2019re approaching it, which is very different from what historically has been done. It is super compelling and ServiceWatch is a very catalytic technology because it helps customers understand what opportunities they have to really advance, how you manage services in an enterprise versus just managing infrastructure. So that\u2019s a big one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously we have a lot more irons in the fire right now. So our business is just becoming very exciting because we\u2019re just pushing on a number of different areas and they are all moving, and this just we used to be a business that was driven primarily on the replacement of legacy helped us businesses that we have coming off a long way since that time. We are just becoming a very strategic platform for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Furby</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, and then, Frank, just a follow up. You talked a little bit about it I think maybe Mike did about the different comp plans, so just curious if you can give a little more color in terms of the thought process of fiscal \u201814 versus \u20185 and \u201816 and why it sort of changes back and forth there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean you are always trying to tweak your comp plan, and through our sales organization, there were decisions to change the plan and coming into 2016 now, we decided we wanted to make our plan a little bit richer because that will help attract people and retain people in our sales and marketing organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Frank. The one thing that I can add to that, you\u2019re probably wondering why don\u2019t these plans will get cheaper consistently over time, again, it\u2019s not a spreadsheet. Sometimes when we\u2019re adding territories where people are going to need more time to get productive. We\u2019re not going to have an aggressive -- we are going to have an aggressive comp plan there, right. So the bigger you get, the more you are in nascent territories you have to tweak your plans to make sure that people have an opportunity to make money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So depending on what phase we\u2019re in, what territory we\u2019re in, you are going to see that move around. So I think we are being just very thoughtful that we are doing it the right way rather than taking purely a spreadsheet mentality to do that thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Furby</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks. And if I could just ask one more just on Q4 billing and I hate to go back to it, but services revenue Mike I\u2019m just curious if the difference between you being the midpoint of guidance versus beating it, does it have to do with services I guess did it surprise you in terms of the deflection to the partnering ecosystem or was it in line with what you thought for Q4?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was in line with what we thought for Q4, and it was purely a subscription renewal error.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Furby</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Jesse Hulsing with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jesse Hulsing</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. Frank, when you look at the mix of opportunities on the service management side of the house, how was the mix trending between what you might call traditional ITSM and finance facilities, HR, kind of the newer platform opportunities?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I don\u2019t have any sort of hard data to sort of characterize that in a very fundamental way. But more in a qualitative sense, the vast majority of our customers are now looking at service management really as an enterprise initiative, as an enterprise platform. They are looking at service integration strategies. They really don\u2019t want their organization to have to know that you have to go to IT for this thing, you got to go to HR for that thing. People shouldn\u2019t have to know what the boundaries between organizations are, especially when it comes to procurement. Does this go through IT? Does this go through facilities? Does this go through purchasing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s where organizations are looking to put a service cloud infrastructure in place where nobody needs to know what happens behind the curtain. That\u2019s the whole nature of cloud is that you obfuscate the whole backend infrastructure and you just don\u2019t need to know. You just submit your request and it gets automatically provisioned. It works the same way as Federal Express and Amazon information will find you, you don\u2019t have to keep checking back. That\u2019s really what our customers are after.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, oftentimes IT is the starting point. I think that will be the case for a long time to come because IT tends to be the leader in the organization that\u2019s really bringing the service model to the other service domain in the enterprise. But we probably have 300, 400 customers now that are on HR service management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s growing a leaps and bounds. We have all business units around it. Customer service also ties in facilities management. That\u2019s a big area because that\u2019s now the external phasing side of service management. So we just think that we have just tons and tons of opportunity. The days that this was strictly an IT function, they are well in the past at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jesse Hulsing</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And a quick follow-up. I am looking at your investor deck and you\u2019ve broken out your addressable markets and provided a lot of granularity about how you are arriving at those numbers. But a lot of them are outside of traditional ITSM. Outside of ITOM which you have broken out metrics for, which one of those buckets, whether it\u2019s customer service or PPM or another bucket, do you expect to have the most growth in \u201816 and into \u201817?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball. All of those things are hot, they really are. They are on the move. Depending on who you ask, you will get a different answer. Security is red hot. Customer service surprised the hell out of us, the deals were very large. They were very rapid. They came from places that we didn\u2019t necessarily expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re learning all kinds of things. The combination of PPM, which is project management and financials, is becoming a very hot commodity as well. We have such a nice opportunity upselling from our platform with all these different services. So it\u2019s great to be in sales at this company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jesse Hulsing</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Ashley</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks so much. I wonder if you could just comment first of all on ELA activity in the period if there was much and if you\u2019re seeing an increase in that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, we really didn\u2019t see the ELAs in the period at all. It was our typical licensing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Ashley</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And then, lastly, ITOM, everyone has been drilling on it and you guys have pointed out that really there is a great enterprise opportunity. Is that also a commercial/mid-market opportunity with the ITOM products?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, absolutely, there is. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever set something to the contrary, that really doesn\u2019t stop at the large enterprise doors. Our products scale down very nicely. Even in Express, one of the things that we have added to Express was our discovery kit ability. That was one of the things that was glaringly missing in the first incarnation of that product. People had to have that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019re talking about really small shops now that want to be able to discover all the laptops and desktops and service that they have and be able to manage the operating histories. So ITOM is integral to any service management deployment, whether it\u2019s huge or whether it\u2019s small.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Ashley</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Thank you. I\u2019m just looking at the stock down about 50%, big move, and I\u2019m wondering to myself, as solid as your growth is, there is a bit of deceleration in billings relative to where you were at the start of the year whether you look at ACV of your G2K, the growth rate there, the sequential deferred revenue growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, on the flipside, you are turning way the hell more profitable than anybody expected about a year back or so. So, clearly, your cash flow and op income generation are significantly ahead of people\u2019s expectations. But the growth did decelerate a little bit. And I do completely appreciate the point that you -- had you known what you knew on December 15th, the numbers would have been right in line midpoint or even high-end, perhaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is this merely a conscious decision on your part to slow down the rate at which you\u2019re -- not slow down the rate at which you\u2019re hiring, but the second derivative sales headcount you\u2019re adding 400, you added last year 400 is it a conscious decision that as you progress being a larger company going through revenue deceleration that you get that natural margin expansion or is it that the market itself is somewhat limited that you have to slow down the growth rate and not necessarily keep up that $1 billion business growing 50% as you have been at the start of this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Frank. Maybe, again, I can put a little bit of an angle to this. We went and we are still going through a bit of a transformation in the sense that we are becoming a multiproduct, multimarket and even multichannel type company. Before we were literally scaling on the single product, single market, single channel and by the way that went exceptionally well for us, but the transformation as I just described it is not trivial one over a year ago we completely changed our product organization to be able to drive on multiple fronts at the same time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we have gradually implemented that focus throughout the organization in the solution consulting teams, which is a pre-sales organization and the sales organization itself, so that we can bring that multiproduct orientation to the entire company. That\u2019s not an easy transition to go through. You just don\u2019t keep sort of ramming bodies and maintain the same momentum. Because there are different kind of hiring profiles, skill profiles, different organizations that absorb these people.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we went through a ton of that transition in 2015 and we feel we\u2019re in a really, really good place to be able to grow and expand with the structure and the model that we have. We\u2019ll be able to buy assets, we\u2019re able to build assets and really add-on to our model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s probably the best explanation that I can give. Obviously, there is large numbers as well. We just cruised through the $1 billion full year revenue. We haven\u2019t been there yet right, and so we\u2019re also getting used to the scale and size of everything that\u2019s going on in this company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have offices in 64 different places around the world. It\u2019s becoming a good size business and we\u2019re growing into it and we\u2019re pushing hard. So feeling good -- feeling very good about where we are in our evolution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And one for Scarpelli, no change to close rates in Q4 relative to Q4 last year, or was there any change sequentially year-over-year, and if yes, what kind of close rate assumption are you using for your billings forecast, Mike, for 2016? That's it from me. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So first of all, we never disclose close rates\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Directionally\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There was nothing unusual about this Q4 in comparison to last Q4. And I am comfortable with the guidance we gave for 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Frank, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the strength to the commercial business and the productivity you\u2019ve seen there, but didn\u2019t hear any commentary on the enterprise side. Could you just characterize the kind of the level of productivity tracking out of that segment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, there was a reason I mentioned the commercial businesses because you guys got so rattled a year ago, and it took several quarters to shake that off. So, I thought I\u2019d just make a few -- put some color on that business, because it\u2019s been a very successful transformation for us. The reality is our business is sort of 50-50 large enterprise global on the one hand, and then the commercial business the other half. So we have to really drive both sides of that business equally hard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, our growth assumptions are based on both those business be able to sort of maintain that 50% share of the overall pie. But there\u2019s no doubt that if you left everybody here to their own devices, we would gravitate towards the very large enterprise, because those are the most productive, most lucrative business relationships that we have in this company. And that\u2019s the reason why we created the commercial organization, because we were not to let that happen. We were going to make sure that we would have dedicated focus on these other markets. It\u2019s more fragmented, the deals are smaller, but still outstanding business for us and we like it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Derrick, just to support the strength in enterprise, we did add 26 Global 2000 in the quarter. It was actually 33 with adjustments with acquisitions and stuff. So we now have 638 Global 2000 and you saw that we now have over 200 -- we have 230 customers that pay us over $1 million a year each. I think the average is right around $2.1 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that continues to grow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then, Frank, you mentioned the CSC and Accenture having acquired two of your biggest partners. Just be curious to hear how those relationships have evolved? Has there been any disruption or vice versa, are you using were tailwinds with kind of resources and pull through? Just to hear about how those evolved that would be helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. It\u2019s actually made our relationships with those folks more intense, more strategic. We\u2019ve just become more important, in relative terms to them as a platform than we were before they made these acquisitions. Right? So the fun and games is over with. We now have real live investments in it. The real business is they have managers, they have plans, they have targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Accenture was a premier sponsor at our global sales kickoff last week. This is a really big growth opportunity for them and we\u2019re happy to be partnering with them. We were -- the nice thing about having folks like CSC and Accenture is they have transformational capabilities that they can bring to our very large customers. We\u2019re really raising the expectations on what outcomes people really should expect from ServiceNow deployment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re thrilled to have these people in our business and our customers are happy as well. They have real good variety of choices, a very broad pool of talent to engage. That\u2019s been a complaint that we historically have had is that we grew very rapidly and we were always exhausting the resources in the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is one of the reasons why we\u2019ve carefully cultivated our ecosystem. We didn\u2019t want to crowd out our partners, because we would really constrain our own growth if we did that. So I think these relationships are great, and they\u2019re going to be growing and more important -- become more important as we go on here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks guys for taking my questions. Frank, you mentioned this in your continuing sort of increasing TAM or just applicability of your guys' services, security, customer service, et cetera. And when you think about just the go-to-market strategy here, is there anything changing as you just continue to expand the applicability in \u201816 versus \u201815?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I know you talked on the comp plan, but anything sort of structural to the Salesforce on the go-to-market strategy? And then, a quick follow up to just for housekeeping items. Wonder if you just quantify the billings error there and was it $4 million, $5 million, just sort of how much lower would have guidance with that? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Scarpelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the billing error was $5 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Frank Slootman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On your question, Phil. This is Frank. The structural difference that we started that we have embarked on and that\u2019s still going on is that we have a high degree of product specialization in the various organizations, and we started that on the pre-sales side. We have it on the sales side. We have it on the professional services side. Obviously this all started in the -- with the product team. So our whole organization has a fully built out product dimension to it. And but not all GEOs have the same amount of product specialization. So that investment will be ongoing as we scale we will be having more and more dedicated resources that relate to these specific areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You can imagine the security management, we are not a security company by our DNA set if you will, but we stood up a product organization with nothing but security people in there. We have always had security people in the field because being a cloud company security is a really big topic of conversation with our customers. But we have to have very dedicated, very specialized people to be very effective and credible with our customers to drive those kinds of businesses. But the opportunity is so great that for us to make those investments is a no-brainer and that\u2019s what we are doing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Phil Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it.
