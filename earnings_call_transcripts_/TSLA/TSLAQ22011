Welcome. I\u2019ll just make a few comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'm incredibly excited by the sales and the interest in the Model X. When you introduce a product that is really groundbreaking and innovative, you don\u2019t necessarily know how customers are going to react to that, and they reacted incredibly well. From a customer standpoint, the Model X was clearly a homerun and they\u2019re (inaudible) with their dollars by putting down reservations on the Model X. And in fact, if anyone on the call is interested in Model X, I recommend putting down a deposit soon because this is by far the bestselling product in Tesla history by a significant margin. So it\u2019s, yeah, just great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, you know, that\u2019s the main thing I wanted to mention. And then the other thing being that we\u2019ve begun work on our first full Mercedes powertrain. Previously we\u2019ve done the battery packs and the chargers; now we\u2019re doing an entire powertrain for Mercedes. As is Tesla policy, we don\u2019t comment on the details of powertrain agreements. We leave that to our strategic partner. So that\u2019s (inaudible) when they want to speak in more detail about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But with those introductory comments, let\u2019s jump in to questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. (Operator Instructions).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question comes from Amir Rozwadowski at Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, gentlemen. And Elon, on the discussion of the Daimler contract, I realize that you folks don\u2019t provide too much color in terms of the partnership, but in the past you have highlighted that you have a number of these discussions underway. Are these the folks that you had suggested could ultimately end up being a pretty significantly sized opportunity? Or should we assume that that is with someone else at the moment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tricky question. I have to break that question part a little bit. There are -- this -- I do expect that this deal will be significant and probably more significant than the sum of all deals we\u2019ve done with Daimler to date. And that\u2019s about all I can say on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, are there other fields of significance in discussion? Yes, there are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then if I may, you folks had provided some color in terms of where your revenue -- where you expect your revenues to be in 2012. And certainly as I think you\u2019ve fairly been consistent, that it\u2019s going to be fairly back-half-weighted to the launch of the Model S. I was wondering if you could give us some color in terms of the mix of the Model S reservations that you have so far. In terms of running the numbers, it does seem as though you're going to be delivering on the high-end versions first, and I\u2019d love to hear sort of mix potential, what you guys are factoring for ASPs for your deliveries for the year, or any color along those lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So I do expect that is going to be weighted towards the higher-end versions of the Model S. And necessarily for the signature series which (inaudible) all the options -- the first 1,000 vehicles. But then even beyond that, we\u2019re -- we don\u2019t deliver regular series with (inaudible) mile range, and then we got to the 230-mile range. And then 160-mile range (inaudible) 2012, early next year. So that\u2019s necessarily going to shift the weighting towards the higher-end version of the Model S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll have I think a much better sense (inaudible) precise sense for that in the coming months as we\u2019re, you know, release the configurator and see exactly what options we will take.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And lastly, if I may, there\u2019s been a lot of questions around concerns on cash positioning (inaudible) loans among the industry at the moment. It seems from your prepared comments you feel comfortable with your current cash position and liquidity. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color in terms of how you view that progressing through the end of the year and into the beginning of next? I mean, do you feel that with the trajectory of the Model S at this point, you feel comfortable in terms of how that\u2019s going to sort of pan out for your cash burn situation currently?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I feel confident saying that Tesla does not need to ever raise another financing round. It doesn\u2019t need. It\u2019s possible that we may choose that we may want to do so, but importantly, we do not need to do so, is my projection. So, yeah, we\u2019re in a strong cash position, our relationship with the DOE is very good. So I feel pretty secure on those fronts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much for the incremental color.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you. Our next question in queue comes from Jesse Pichel with Jefferies. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good evening. Jesse Pichel from Jefferies. Congratulations on the launch last week. Thank you for hosting us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is, from a branding and strategic perspective, how should we think about the Mercedes brand cannibalizing Tesla products? And what keeps Tesla differentiated from your customers in this particular supply arrangement?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, absolutely. Well, as you may have heard me say on a few occasions, that (inaudible) catalyst for electric vehicles, so we want to do everything we can to advance of course electric cars whether that\u2019s cars we make ourselves or cars that we help others make. And at the end of the day, if (inaudible) engineering isn\u2019t up to par but our powertrain is, then obviously that would lend us to become more of a powertrain company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I think that we do good (inaudible) and good powertrain engineering and that our products will find a place in the market. And that\u2019s as demonstrated by the customer interest really.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then (inaudible) the new car market is something like 80 million vehicles a year. The Model S actual production is 20,000 vehicles a year. It\u2019s a very tiny portion of the market. We\u2019re certainly not (inaudible) the business away from (inaudible) business away from partners and nor are they taking (inaudible). So we\u2019re still at a small portion of the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when comparing vehicles, I think it\u2019s important to think about comparing say premium sedans or premium SUVs rather than thinking of say the Model S, the Model X is competing against this (inaudible) all electric vehicles which range from golf cart to Nissan Leaf, to whatever the case may be. That\u2019s not really what people think of, you know, when somebody is looking at buying a Model S, they\u2019re considering that against something like an Audi A6 or A8 or against probably Porsche Panamera or BMW 5 Series, 7 Series. That really tends to be the basis of comparison.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Peter Christiansen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Christiansen \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Peter in for Steve Milunovich. Elon, I was wondering if you can just give us some color on the range, the guidance range. Is that more of a function of Model S output or the timing of development services rather (inaudible) and how does that tie into your gross margin outlook?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I\u2019ll let Deepak answer most of that. But I'm going to -- certainly the bulk of the 2012 revenue is Model S related. Deepak?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I mean there are three elements to this, Steve. Obviously the biggest one is our projection of 5,000 Model S\u2019s which drives it. And then we have our own growth to sales that we will have in Europe and in Asia. And beyond that, we have the powertrain components business with Toyota. And then some bit of development services revenue with OEMs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Christiansen \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And then -- I'm sorry. And then I was -- I'm sorry. I was wondering if you can characterize the revenue opportunity of providing a full drive train solution versus some of your previous programs, notwithstanding a different batter size?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Are you referring to the Daimler program?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Christiansen \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The full -- well, clearly there is more revenue but it\u2019s, in our mind, it\u2019s the ability to provide to Daimler a much higher performing (inaudible) which includes the full integration of our systems, it allows us to provide a much more cost-effective and higher performing [ED] to Daimler rather than just our battery packs which is integrated into their system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, exactly. But (inaudible) is a really seamless integration, it\u2019s a better customer experience, and everything is really optimized with the other elements. And we demonstrated that for Daimler (inaudible).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Christiansen \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And just one last one, Elon, you just talked about the difference between needing additional financing or wanting one. And one would assume that could apply accelerating the Gen III program. If that were the case, what would be your thought process? Would it be driven more by the momentum and the confidence that you're experiencing right now, or possibly a response to some other competitive threats that you see from other OEMs?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I'm not too worried about competitive threats because the market is so big, that what we\u2019re really focused on is not what, say, anyone -- any other company is doing but rather, are we making the best possible product? Is there anything we can do to make a product that is going to amaze and delight customers more? And then that\u2019s I think the right thing to focus on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are going to do at the next significant vehicle -- the next major big announcement after Model X will be a Gen III. And I made (inaudible) to some of the media, but (inaudible) reaffirming that. Previously we were going to do a next-generation Roadster after Model X, but I'm absolute -- gained enough confidence that the technology will be scalable to higher volumes but maybe a bit [thinner]. And so we\u2019ll be able to go to our third-generation (inaudible) pricing kind of $30,000 range. And if we were to accelerate that, there could be a (inaudible) argument for doing a modest capital raise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Christiansen \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You're welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Dan Galves with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Galves \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. I'm wondering if you could take us a little bit through kind of a near-term certification process or qualification process for the Model S. Just curious considering that you're still -- have some dies arriving in the next couple of months, what are the key bottlenecks that could come up and qualification? And what level of vehicles need to be used to qualify for driving on US roads in terms of whether it\u2019s a beta or a release candidate vehicle or something with dies production intent parts from the factory?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Especially (inaudible) that before the dies are shipped from [Fujio] (inaudible) plant, they actually do send a number of (inaudible) so that we actually do get production body parts before the die is shipped and are making (inaudible) with those production body parts. That way when we receive the dies, then we put them into our (inaudible) presses and all we\u2019re doing is just clarifying that there\u2019s no meaningful difference between the (inaudible). But the die themselves are sorted out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as risks for production timing, yeah, I can provide a little bit of color there. Previously I set a goal we expect to be five-star on average, but maybe we\u2019ll be four-star in some categories. It\u2019s looking increasingly like we will be five-star in all categories. That is looking increasingly optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This particular challenge was the fifth percentile female in the passenger -- preference passenger seat. And just had a meeting this morning which looks like we\u2019ll be able to achieve (inaudible) in that category, which is great news. We\u2019re going to be -- we\u2019ll be doing some pretty innovative things, working with (inaudible). So that\u2019s good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think (inaudible) timeline is on track in terms of the specification that Dan was asking (inaudible) that certification is self-certification and (inaudible) production (inaudible) and as we mentioned, the dies in [Fujio] are producing the parts which allow us to make the body and get that certification done. So, five-star (inaudible) suggesting that I should reaffirm that it\u2019s looking like we\u2019ll be five-star on -- in all categories. I don\u2019t want to say for sure sure, but that it\u2019s working like that\u2019s quite likely. So I just -- if there\u2019s any ambiguity, sorry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019ve answered Dan\u2019s questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Galves \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, it\u2019s very clear. Then my second question has to do with your R&amp;D factor, if you will, with work probably winding down on the Model S coming off and ramping up on the Model X, will you have additional capacity in R&amp;D? I guess my real question is, would you have the capacity with your current R&amp;D staff to begin work on a Gen III vehicle let\u2019s say by early 2013 after the Model S is fully launched?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think so. That\u2019s the plan of action exactly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Galves \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. All right, great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question in queue is from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good afternoon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Patrick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My -- I guess -- my first question would be, as we think about -- I think reading through here, it sounds like if you look at the R&amp;D and CapEx plan for 2012, it\u2019s largely model -- still Model S focused, unless I'm mistaken, right? I think the wording is that on the R&amp;D front, by the end there is some X spending that picks up. How do we think about what that might look like both on a CapEx basis next year for, you know, where I'm presuming the R&amp;D and the CapEx for that program is going to be really at its peak? How should we think about that, maybe whatever you're comfortable talking about, maybe year-on-year comparison or a comparison of how it is visa vie what you spent on the S, presumably obviously it\u2019s a lot less because it\u2019s on the same platform. So, just helping the dimension on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">(inaudible) firstly, the R&amp;D spending on the S should reduce in the second half, as we have said in the letter, not just towards the end of 2012. Because once we go into the production of the S, a lot of our manufacturing expenses, pre-production which are presently in R&amp;D will move into cost of goods sold. So there should be a substantial reduction. And we will be done with a lot of the spending we are presently incurring on building the prototype and casting them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, yes, there will be some ongoing R&amp;D on S as we look to bring out a European version or fine-tune some other things, we\u2019ll be at a lower level. And then we\u2019ll see a pickup in the spending at that point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The same goes for CapEx. A lot of our CapEx is in the first half, is heavily weighted. We (inaudible) suppliers both for tooling and equipment. The final payment is once we sign off on the tuning and the equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I think about just how those things trend into 2013, one would expect that perhaps you get a bigger spike in R&amp;D than you would maybe in CapEx because you can leverage some of the equipment. How do we think about that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the leverage is there in both R&amp;D and CapEx. I can\u2019t tell you specifically where the bigger leverage is. Our spending on the Model X is going to be very substantially lower overall than the S because we\u2019re leveraging every element of the manufacturing factory, the platform, the powertrain. So it\u2019s -- and there\u2019s quite a bit of communization of parts in areas where you can\u2019t see the differences between the S and the X.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But you're probably right, but as Deepak said, just maybe if -- there\u2019s saving in both, but relatively speaking, there\u2019s probably more savings in CapEx than there are in R&amp;D.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Taking a step back in terms of more of a product question, how are you thinking about sort of higher mileage vehicles in your product cadence? I think at the Detroit Auto Show you had put up a slide suggesting it would not be inconceivable to get your cost per kilowatt-hour to I want to say something like 200, if I'm remembering correctly. You\u2019ve mentioned the next-gen and perhaps after that maybe a new Roadster, but might there be an interim demand for an S or an X with even higher mileage capabilities just given the availability of cheaper batteries?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Well, just like that phrase in Texas Hold \u2018Em, like you never know what the (inaudible) going to be. Well, you never know. It could be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And I guess last one, just I know you guys have reiterated thus far, but the four, but just to remind myself, what kind of IP protections do you have in place when you do these programs with other OEMs? What kind of restrictions are there to prevent them from leveraging what they learn from working with you? And doing it in -- doing something independently?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our relationship with Toyota and Daimler where we have these programs has been such that they\u2019re very respectful of our IP, and certainly we don\u2019t see any issues where this relationship is based on their desire to do things the wrong way. I mean we feel very comfortable. And as we grow that business, we\u2019ll work at, and if we get to very high volumes, we\u2019ll look at licensing and other opportunities to manage that growth. But at this time we\u2019re not concerned about our IP in these relationships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I must say, if I could, it\u2019s been really great working with Toyota and Daimler. I mean they\u2019re really (inaudible) companies. There\u2019s been no indication at all of them wanting to (inaudible) IP. And we\u2019ve got pretty clear agreements delineating what IP (inaudible) which company, and we really have no (inaudible) at all. So it\u2019s quite a bit of mutual trust there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do of course have patents and we\u2019ve got quite a few patents. But it\u2019s never really even been a point of contention amazingly, so. And we\u2019ve actually said that we\u2019re open to licensing IP as well, so (inaudible) we necessarily have to be the ones manufacturing (inaudible) want to do that, then we can license the IP. And at a certain volume, like getting 100,000 units or something, that makes a lot of sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So (inaudible) model in that sense. But yes. I should say (inaudible) able to hear what (inaudible) but the -- I think the (inaudible) card is going to be the Supercharger, when people really see how (inaudible). It\u2019s (inaudible). We\u2019ll unveil that with all the elements of the Supercharger later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s just for -- that\u2019s the stage three charger, correct?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s beyond stage three.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, very good. Well, congratulations on all the benchmarks met so far, and thanks for taking my question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Himanshu Patel with JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good afternoon, guys. A few questions. Just I wanted to clarify on the R&amp;D, you did $208 million in full-year 2011. You're sort of indicating about a $70 million annualized reduction from the sort of falloff on Model S and Fremont-related costs. Kind of gets you to a run rate of $138 million, and then you're kind of indicating some uptick from there related to the Model X in the second half. I guess, could you just simplify all of this and just give us a 2012 R&amp;D number that you're thinking? And then also what -- any sort of dimensioning you can do on sort of just the run rate of that number prospectively, either in absolute terms or as a percentage of sales?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think, Himanshu, we\u2019ll see some increase in Q1 and Q2 because we\u2019re just adding a lot more people in our manufacturing facility. And as we indicated in our letter, there\u2019s about $15 million to $20 million of manufacturing-related expense that comes out in the second half once we\u2019ve moved the cars, and then when you add in a bit of Model X. I think we are specifically not giving a guidance, but giving you sufficient granularity and trend here that I'm sure you can work it out reasonably well in your model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But Deepak, I just wanted to be clear, it sounds like there\u2019s two issues going on with the R&amp;D costs. There\u2019s a reduction happening from just an accounting reallocation from R&amp;D to COGS and then there\u2019s another, sounds like another reduction happening from just the kind of turning off, if you will, of elevated costs related to the Model S launch and the Fremont factory. My understanding was the $15 million to $20 million per quarter reduction which was kind of the genesis of my $70 million annualized comment, is that related to the latter or the former?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The former.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I see. How much of -- so that\u2019s just -- those costs don\u2019t actually go away entirely, they just kind of get reallocated from R&amp;D into cost of goods sold?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And is there a reduction, sort of an overall cost reduction in the corporation regardless of where it gets [binned] on the P&amp;L. Just related to the fact that the Model S development is behind you, you indicated that the X is going to be considerably lower cost, presuming a lot of the costs related to getting Fremont now may have been hitting the R&amp;D line as well. What is the sort of reduction associated with that regardless of where it\u2019s sort of cost side on the P&amp;L?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, there is a reduction related to that, you're absolutely right, and that will be partially offset by some spending in X that we talked about. There are some cannibalization there which is we have a sense of it but it depends on how our spending goes by quarter. So we aren\u2019t giving any specific numbers. But I think overall we\u2019ll be in the 200 or so range for R&amp;D. And we can -- I think when you run the models, you come somewhere there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two hundred for this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then the next question is just the Roadster, what is the long-term plan for that? Will that be reincarnated at some stage or is this just kind of being -- going into sunset forever?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, with the Roadster, first version Roadster, was really to create a real collector\u2019s item. It\u2019s obviously the first 5.0 electric car (inaudible) and I think it\u2019s likely to be one of the first true collective cars of the 21st century, and we want it to be that, that\u2019s why we kept volume at 2,500. There will be at some point a new-generation Roadster, but from my earlier comments, that\u2019s going to come after the third-generation vehicles. So that\u2019s pushes it out probably about four years or so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Elon, just kind of going back to one of the earlier questions, there\u2019s sort of this theoretical curve, if you will, on prospective cost per kilowatt-hour reduction that I'm sure you\u2019ve got some historic data to sort of support, and then there\u2019s sort of the stuff you're working on right now that may just be invalidation and there\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a matter of time before you actually get there. Can you just mention for us how much of that kind of $200 per kilowatt-hour number is sort of in the bag from the engineering efforts that you can see and know that the organization has pretty good visibility on right now versus something that you haven\u2019t really figured out exactly how you're doing it but you sort of know over time that will happen?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I'm not sure we\u2019ve actually ever said anything about, you know, we probably (inaudible) so I mean I wouldn\u2019t want people to assume that we have. I do think that cost per kilowatt-hour at the [cell] level will decline below that, below $200 in the not-too-distant future. But I don\u2019t want to -- that\u2019s -- then there\u2019s incremental cost per pack, the cost at the [cell] level (inaudible) cost at the pack (inaudible) systems and -- are included.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, obviously the cost per kilowatt-hour of the battery pack is a higher proprietary number. So that\u2019s something we guard pretty closely in terms of where it is at any given point in time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Maybe just one last question, what was the kind of thought process on opening up the reservation book for the X at this moment, or would you -- I mean clearly there\u2019s some demand for it, but any risks that there could be some cannibalization of S volumes?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. Actually we\u2019re concerned that perhaps there would be some cannibalization of the S. In fact, the opposite occurred. We\u2019ve seen higher Model S reservations, not lower. And I think it\u2019s kind of like when people see that you\u2019ve got more than one product in the lineup, that that actually is complementary. Kind of like you go into a store and it\u2019s kind of better if the store sells pants and shorts, not just being a shorts store. So I mean that\u2019s what we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think people saw the press and pictures of the X and then some of them came to the website and said, well, X was really cool, but I prefer a sedan, and bought the Model S. And we\u2019ve actually had customers who decided to buy both. So that\u2019s -- really the objective (inaudible) is that it\u2019s complementary, not competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Himanshu Patel \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. (Operator Instructions).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Andrea James with Dougherty &amp; Co. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Andrea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So what needs to happen before you can offer a test drive on the Model S to a customer? And I guess, what seems to be the position of those first 5,000 customers? Will they all need to test drive or will some be happy to take delivery without that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the assumption of customers is that they\u2019re just going to take delivery. There\u2019s no presumption of a test drive before delivery. There may be a few that want to do that, but my sense is, in talking to those customers, really is that they just want the car as soon as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of test drives, we have to wait until the car is fully (inaudible) and so that\u2019s really effectively going to be at the point that we\u2019re delivering the first production cars. So that\u2019s (inaudible) this year is when people will be able to take a test drive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And over time we\u2019ll have a lot more cars out there, Andrea, so clearly any customer who wants so a test drive before (inaudible) that should not be a problem at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, absolutely. In fact, given the fact that there\u2019s excess demand for the Model S, even if somebody doesn\u2019t like the Model S, they are probably -- should probably take delivery and then sell it, because I expect that the cars will sell for more than the [nominal class].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So it sounds like from your view, given the choice of delivering a car to a customer or setting that car aside for test drive, you would just do the delivery?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. We\u2019re going to do a little bit of both, so there won\u2019t be cars that are -- lock-in cars that are delivered to the stores for test drives. That\u2019s (inaudible) delivered to (inaudible) customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then moving on just Toyota, how has your communication gone with them, as far as them saying this is what we need and when, and do they give you hard targets or moving targets? And also just, you know, you said you're going to do a shipment in Q2. Is that in line with the rev recs on that contract? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Toyota, as you can imagine, has very established processes and systems. So they -- and they have suppliers globally. So they have a fairly stable production plan which they share with us in advance. So have full clarity and visibility of what they need. And clearly the components that we will supply to them in Q2, the revenue on those wouldn\u2019t be recognized when we deliver those components like any other supplier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And you think it\u2019ll be kind of lumpy there then?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I don\u2019t think so. I think there\u2019s going to be a ramp-up as we take up the production rate, but it won\u2019t be lumpy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Matthew. Good evening guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Adam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Elon. Just to follow up on the test drive question. Would the magazines\u2019 first chance to drive the Model S also coincide with deliveries to customers in the middle of the year or would there be an opportunity before?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Probably coincide, yeah. We definitely don\u2019t want to -- I mean we (inaudible) before we get it to any auto/motor journalist to test drive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. Deepak, in 2011, it looks like your cash was just under negative $300 million or $290 million. Can you at this point confirm, given the assumption of 5,000 in its deliveries of the Model S, that cash earned in 2012 should be significantly less than this amount, or still negative but less negative?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it will be. Our cash flow from operations here, clearly we have reservations in play as well as working capital needs, and in our case as we ramp up, we can have some benefits in working capital given the difference in payments to our suppliers versus payments that we collect from our customers. So, yes, it\u2019ll be less than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Just a follow-on, the CapEx outlook, the $200 million to $220 million, any rough split of how much of that is related to final spending on the Model S versus early spending on the Model X or the other buckets which include retail or development work or early Gen III? Any idea of a roughly split?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we have, as you clearly said, we have the buckets of spending on putting new stores out there, service centers. We are also going to do some super-charging installations, as Elon mentioned, and then spending on the X. It\u2019s going to be the majority is I would say S, I\u2019d leave it at that. And I think that gives you enough granularity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I appreciate that. And just finally on the Model X reservations, it\u2019d be nice if we could continue that daily amount. But looking at that split, I know it\u2019s early data, but how does the reservation amount compare to the roughly $11,000 per reservation that you\u2019re giving on average to the Model S?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess you may be getting into that average because we collect $40,000 on the signature series and 5,000 on general production. We have a combination of signature and general production reservations on the X. I don\u2019t have that number off-hand, what that breakdown is, but we\u2019re getting substantial signature reservations, no doubt about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the X?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the X, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Excuse me. Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And presuming with the order of magnitude difference on the upfront reservation for signature X would be comparable to a signature S versus the higher batter non-signature S?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the Model S, there\u2019s kind of regular series which is a $5,000 reservation, and then there\u2019s signature series which is $40,000, the same for the Model X. And the $5,000 number is (inaudible) of the configuration of the Model S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. Okay. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question in queue is from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good afternoon, guys. A lot of attention is being paid on the number of dies that you have in Fremont. Is it possible that you don\u2019t have all dies there at the manufacturing plant and you're still stamping some parts with your partner yet still delivering vehicles? I know that\u2019s not your best-case scenario, but is that an option you would have to meet your delivery timeline?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we have enough gap in between that we don\u2019t see that as a possibility. We expect just (inaudible) the dies if not all of them to be here by early Q2, which is enough time to fine-tune them and use them for the production [card].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. But would that be a possibility if something came up where you can\u2019t get the dies?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s always the possibility, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We could always have a lot of possible (inaudible) while the die is coming, but clearly that\u2019s not part of the plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And could you talk about how you get to the 10,000 to 15,000 delivery number outlook for 2014?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the Model X?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, for the Model X.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we\u2019re just scaling that as roughly two-and-a-half to three-quarters of Model S. And it could be higher than that. I mean I -- I think this, based on the demand we\u2019ve seen thus far, probably will be higher than that. But we don\u2019t know -- I think it probably will be higher than that. So (inaudible) exact number but it\u2019s --</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe should put it as a good conservative projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say conservative projection, yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. And then actually finally, could you just talk about your five-star rating and the timing around that? Do we don\u2019t need that five-star rating before the cars get actually sold, is that correct? It sounds like that could come after you start marketing the cars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I mean, you do everything that\u2019s necessary to achieve the five-star rating and then it is officially awarded at some point after start of production, yeah. But I mean you pretty know in advance what it\u2019s going to be, yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And to your point, you're right, we don\u2019t have to have a five-star rating to get at the time of the production. It\u2019s our goal to get there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s no regulatory requirement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, no, absolutely. Really our goal with the Model S was to create the safest car on the road. To be the safest car on the road, you really -- you want to aspire to have five-star in every category, and actually there isn\u2019t a six-star but we\u2019ve aimed for kind of a virtual six-star to achieve the highest possible safety rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo \u2013 Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. Thank you guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question in queue comes from Carter Driscoll with Capstone. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon, gentlemen. First question is around potential financing options. Obviously maybe not quite as relevant for the S or the X but maybe you could talk about what you're attempting to line up for more of the mass market Gen III vehicle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I mean we\u2019d expect to have the full range of leasing and financing options that people are used to seeing for cars. And probably working with a number of large financial institutions to make that happen. We\u2019ve had some very promising talks. And yeah, we definitely want to make sure that the cars are as affordable as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think there\u2019s an argument actually that the appeal of electric cars on the leasing side is going to be greater than on the [production] side, which we certainly see that in solar. It\u2019s much more appealing to have a solar system on a lease basis because people come in, compare that correctly with the costs that they\u2019re paying for the utilities. And since the cost of electricity is so much less than the cost of gasoline, it\u2019s really sort of we\u2019re talking about an order of magnitude difference. By leasing the car and adding that cost to electricity versus -- compared with leased cost with gasoline car and the (inaudible) gasoline which is likely to be increasingly expensive, the value proposition to customers on purely economic level is going to be that much more compelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s what I was kind of driving at is in terms of the volatility of the residual value and using a much more constant coop power [ph] price nationally than certainly differences regionally in gasoline prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My next question is maybe you could, in your own opinion, Elon or Deepak, talk about the different model options you expect people to take in the different models or maybe even compare and contrast the Model S versus the X, and so we could kind of drill down into what you think an ASP might look like, a final ASP might look like, and not necessarily just the base price, at least your best guess?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think Elon sort of answered that at a higher level in one of the earlier questions that initially we will have the signature series which 300, or the 85 kilowatt-hour battery pack, and then we\u2019ll have the base 85 kilowatt-hour battery pack. In addition, we\u2019re going to offer the performance version which we expect to have a fairly significant database given the specs on that. So, between that and the options, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s on average a $10,000 to $15,000 pickup above the base price, which is really normal in the premium segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in 2012 it becomes a mix of sales -- or 2013 rather, becomes a mix of sales in Asia and Europe. The pricing structures are different and the content. What\u2019s standard versus optional is different. As we sort that out for 2013, and I will provide more granularity, but I think 2012 is fairly clear given our plans of launching the different series [for a time].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, just keeping an eye on the time here, we probably have time for questions for maybe one more analyst. So, operator, just one more please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question then comes from Michael Lew with Needham. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pardon me. One moment please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you. And I'm sorry, Michael, your line is open now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you and good afternoon in California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You had mentioned other potential supply agreements in partnerships in the pipeline, and I realize Daimler and Toyota are solid partners, but could you give us a sense of how many other ongoing powertrain development discussions are going on with other automakers and are they for more mainstream vehicles or luxury-type of offerings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'm sorry but I can\u2019t give any color on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And also just -- wanted to follow up on your comments regarding a Gen III mainstream model. Would this be an EV targeted more at the emerging markets like say China or a broader-based type of offering?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It would be targeted worldwide. Certainly includes China. Well, I mean I would say every country in the world, but certainly China. It\u2019s pretty hard to ignore China as a market these days. And I think we\u2019ll -- in fact we expect to be selling the Model S and the Model X in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And yeah, we\u2019re -- we think that there could be a lot of appeal, interestingly, for the Model X, in China. So, yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Also regarding your prior comments on sales -- cost reductions from the current kilowatt-hour pricing. How much -- would it be sort of scale-driven versus a material change driven? Like what would be the split on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few question, even without any material changes (inaudible) scale, you can get a kind chemistry below (inaudible) kilowatt-hour. But that\u2019s -- I think you will see material changes over time that amplify that opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And how long would it take to let\u2019s say qualify and enhance the material-driven change if you want to implement on let\u2019s say the Model S or an existing model at that time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think you\u2019d kind of see most of the material change is coming because you have to implement them at large scale. So it\u2019s not (inaudible) coming that\u2019s just like working in a lab and then very rapidly, you know, very rapidly bring that to full-scale production. Plus you have to assess things like calendar life degradation and particularly as well as cycle life degradation. So you tend to see [self-chemistry] changes coming from a few years away. And we\u2019ve got a roadmap of changes that looks pretty interesting and (inaudible) steady improvement year over year. But that\u2019s not to say we\u2019re going to implement a new chemistry every year. I think we\u2019d probably look to implement new chemistries probably every three years, something like that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham &amp; Co.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to our presenters for any concluding remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jeff Evanson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you over the coming weeks as we attend conference. In particular we will be at the Jefferies Growth Conference next week in New York City. And the week after that, we will be at the Morgan Stanley Technology Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco. So we look forward to seeing many of you at those events. Thank you. Goodbye.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s call. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.</p>", "twitContent": "$TSLA - Tesla Motors' CEO Discusses 4Q2011 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/370491-tesla-motors-ceo-discusses-4q2011-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "16123", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17831", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/370491-tesla-motors-ceo-discusses-4q2011-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/370491-tesla-motors-ceo-discusses-4q2011-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
