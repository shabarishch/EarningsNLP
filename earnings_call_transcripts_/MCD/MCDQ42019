At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.</p> <p><strong>Mike Cieplak</strong></p> <p>Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us a little earlier this quarter.

Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast and is also being recorded for replay via our website.</p> <p>And now, I will<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> turn it over to Chris.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Chris Kempczinski</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thanks, Mike and good morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. It\u2019s great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald\u2019s. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> from my first few months in this role. For the past 3 months, I have been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers, and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we are seeing behind our velocity growth plan. Our people are energized. They are proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction. This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald\u2019s gathering, there is a story to tell of the crew person, who is also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter in life working for McDonald\u2019s or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now in a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald\u2019s can change lives. We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald\u2019s whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you are entering more than just a restaurant, you are walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate, share stories, enjoy simple, but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has held friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions. As we have grown, we have recognized our responsibility as one of the world\u2019s leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe\u2019s most pressing challenges. It\u2019s the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald\u2019s to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world. Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before that, I would like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone, $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we have seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. To put that in perspective, McDonald\u2019s and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours and owner/operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets and in the U.S. it\u2019s at an all-time high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to segment highlights, our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. Importantly, our three largest IDL markets, China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we are now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5.0%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago. Across the country, we are seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018 putting a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization and more, were met with strong approval by our customers. This led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world, execute our strategies with such care and conviction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry and I am equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company is now Head of our U.S business, where he is responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returned to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated Markets, where we had oversight for McDonald\u2019s wholly owned markets outside the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With Joe\u2019s transition, Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald\u2019s career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and has spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America. In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It\u2019s an important role for McDonald\u2019s as we maximize the full potential of our three-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth, while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture. I am thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I will turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Kevin Ozan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Chris talked about our impressive full year results. So let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter. Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we have seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our International Operated Segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter with strong performance across the segment. France and the UK drove the segment\u2019s growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings. The UK reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the U.S., comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing. Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world famous French fries continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners like DoorDash and GrubHub drove incremental orders and the deployment of Dynamic Yield\u2019s suggestive sell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point. Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributors to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies, when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year. Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion in the impact of refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter, primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1% and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF related depreciation. Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year. We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth. We increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. This also speaks to the progress we have made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we have evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. In 2019, our free cash flow $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buyback shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I will turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we are headed in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Chris Kempczinski</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Kevin. No word is the power of the Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. There I saw an engaged owner/operator who knew her customers by name and had made our modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs, some having a full meal, others just having coffee. With the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great tasting food with good value convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner/operator and many others across France and other international markets are growing visits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A similar dynamic is playing out in the UK, where our system is doing a great job meeting customer\u2019s expectations for convenience and speed, while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery. This dynamic is playing out in Italy where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all three peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It\u2019s a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the same time, there is a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our three accelerators: Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery. With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Meanwhile, our digital journey, another critical accelerator is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald\u2019s by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we have significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2020. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Throughout the year, we made target investments to accelerate our capabilities. A suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we are using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want. There is no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald\u2019s by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So, we know there is great potential with digital, but there is also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. I recently announced the creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading corporate strategy and business development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry leading digital experiences for our customers and they will partner with our global technology team to build new product roadmaps and technology solutions to fuel growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With our third accelerator, we are bringing more customers the McDonald\u2019s they love with the convenience of delivery, today, about two-thirds of our restaurants worldwide nearly 25,000 offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald\u2019s Company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets including the U.S for the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth and the UK, where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial and we are doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we have reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. For this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond. Yet, we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption. The topics we have shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first, with great tasting food, convenience and value means collaborating with our franchisee community for successful local execution. That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth and provide new opportunities for McDonald\u2019s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Kevin Ozan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We head into 2020 from a position of strength. The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we will host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer term expectations. With our efficient business model in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid 40s range which includes the following: higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins. With most of our major refranchising effects complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019 with most of the gains in the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as we have become more efficient with G&amp;A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&amp;A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, R&amp;D spend and costs related to our Biennial Worldwide Convention. We expect G&amp;A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to capital, we ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion in line with our expectations. As we have previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects. Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year substantially all in markets outside the U.S. We will spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets and our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China. So, while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we have shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher returning investments. As we enter 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver sustained, long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I will turn back to Chris to close.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Chris Kempczinski</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have been on an ambitious journey the last few years from turnaround to transformation. And through it all, we have made a path forward even as the landscape changes. With these changes, customer expectations evolve, placing new demands on the world\u2019s leading brands. We are ready for that challenge, embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make McDonald\u2019s a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we enter 2020, we do so from a position of strength of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our Velocity Growth Plan, the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble, agile and open in new innovations and new possibilities. We have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020, including Worldwide Convention in April. On a final note, I would like to offer heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald\u2019s system who helped us achieve this milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales this past year. It\u2019s the sum of many things done right, everyday by every employee, supplier, franchisee and crew member around the world. I am proved of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we began a new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let\u2019s begin Q&amp;A.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Charles</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Chris, I know you and Joe are prioritizing U.S. traffic growth in 2020, but can you help outline your confidence this can be achieved? On the one hand, there\u2019s better alignment with operators at the start of this year versus a year ago, which is aided by the simplification efforts that you guys have put in place. But on the other hand, breakfast competition is set to intensify shortly here, will the same-store sales benefit from Experience of the Future likely to be lower in 2020 versus what you saw in 2019?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Andrew. So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the number 1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. One of the things that\u2019s, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. owner operator basis, it\u2019s largely a franchise \u2013 or it\u2019s largely a family business in the U.S. Over half of our franchisees are second and third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that\u2019s an important part of this. And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it\u2019s going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that\u2019s seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There\u2019s obviously a lot of focus and attention that we\u2019re going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest-of-day deal or rest-of-day value, that we need to be competitive on that. So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that, we did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not \u2013 it\u2019s too early to call a trend on this. We\u2019ve got to see this happen over four or five quarters. And so it\u2019s going to be something we\u2019re going to be paying attention to and I\u2019m sure you guys will be asking us about it as well. So more to come on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Gonzalez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It seems like the industry has become a bit more promotional since the start of the year. Would you agree with that or is that typical for this time of the year? And then has your view changed at all in response to the current competitive environment in recent weeks as your competitor gets closer to rolling out breakfast?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Eric. January is always a highly competitive time of the year. So I think the activity that we\u2019re seeing right now, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as being unusually pronounced. I think, again, this is always something that happened at the beginning of the year. But I think what you\u2019re talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share. Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There\u2019s very little traffic growth. In fact, if you\u2019re not growing units, you\u2019ve got a headwind there. So I think that\u2019s one recognition and certainly, you are seeing, I think, just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds. So I think between those two things, it has been a competitive environment, it\u2019s going to continue to be a competitive environment, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m seeing an uptick right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Tarantino</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is on some of the investments you made on the technology side. You made some pretty big bets across the last year or so, and it looks like you\u2019re sort of staffing up to support that technology investment with your G&amp;A spending. So just wondering, one, are there more big investments on the horizon that you see as needed? And then two, have you considered recouping some of those investments or sharing some of the cost of your franchisees through a technology fee or something similar that others have put in place?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do two acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don\u2019t foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we\u2019ve got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with a drive-thru. It\u2019s fully rolled out in Australia. And we\u2019re seeing a comp lift, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done. Similarly, with Apprente, we\u2019ve got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. So I think what you\u2019re seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on \u2013 we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that\u2019s always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we\u2019re certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent and service on that. So I\u2019d say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth, and when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service. On the ongoing costs, the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee, we kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees. So that\u2019s been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don\u2019t see that model changing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Glass</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just following up on that, in the U.S., Chris, how comfortable are you with the check growth that you\u2019ve experienced in 2019? It\u2019s more than 100% of the comp. Is it possible we would see the same kind of check growth in 2020? Or are you less comfortable given that it may hurt the value proposition for the brand? And if you are willing to share, what is the comp lift that you modeled for Dynamic Yield that you\u2019re experiencing currently?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, John. One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the check growth that we\u2019ve gotten, it\u2019s really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We\u2019re seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you\u2019ve got a number of factors that are worked there. You\u2019ve got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order. You have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order. You have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk. You\u2019ve seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, D $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add-on activity. So I think, for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we\u2019re seeing out there, particularly on the labor side that does get priced through and so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we\u2019ve been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we\u2019ve just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that\u2019s what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then regarding kind of quantifying the Dynamic Yield lift, we generally don\u2019t quantify specific components of our comp. What I would say is it will be potentially different in different countries. So right now, we\u2019re certainly getting a bigger lift from Dynamic Yield in the U.S. than in Australia. In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put a Dynamic Yield, there wasn\u2019t as larger a lift as we\u2019re certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately, so that we need \u2013 can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Bittner</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you just talk a little bit more about the CapEx strategy moving forward? When we met in December in New York, it sounded like there was somewhat of a pivot happening in how you were thinking about the CapEx strategy even past 2020. I believe you were really starting to see areas you could invest in moving forward that would maybe keep CapEx elevated. Can you just talk about this? And ultimately, what does your steady-state CapEx look like? And what year do you expect that to occur?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Brian. So as we talked about, we always said \u201819 and \u201820 would be similar. So we had $2.4 billion in 2019, we\u2019ll have a relatively similar amount in 2020. And as we\u2019ve indicated, we expect CapEx to come down some in 2021. The one area that we\u2019re currently reviewing and evaluating is our international business and potential unit expansion there. As you know, our international business is very strong, we see very high returns on investments in new restaurants in those markets, and we believe there\u2019s further potential for unit growth in many of those markets. So we\u2019re currently evaluating the opportunity to invest in some of those new units outside the U.S. You\u2019ll see that we have gone up a little bit in our openings in 2020, growing about 1,400 new units that should, between those and the ones we opened in 2019, contribute roughly 1.5 to our sales growth. So that\u2019s the one area we\u2019re currently evaluating. I think as far as longer term, we want to get through this evaluation, then we\u2019ll talk further about that when we have our Investor Day later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris O\u2019Cull</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is about value. It sounds like everyday value will be necessary to improve the systems\u2019 relative market share this year. And I believe franchisees are only required to feature a few items on the D $1 $2 $3 value menu. So how does the company convince franchisees to be more aggressive with everyday value given the cost pressures they\u2019re facing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think it\u2019s not just everyday value that are \u2013 is part of the equation, there\u2019s also what we would call deal value, which is sort of the post on and off type of value. And so I think from our vantage point, it\u2019s probably going to be more of the latter in terms of how do we smartly and in a disciplined way, pulse deal value throughout the year on this, and where are there opportunities for us to do it that, in a way, can drive both traffic and can protect margins. So we\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations on that. As you would imagine, I\u2019m not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it. But I think back to a couple of the earlier points that we\u2019ve talked about here, there is strong alignment with the owner/operators the U.S. that we need to be in a situation where we\u2019re getting both transaction growth as well as check growth. And so it\u2019s up to us now to deliver on it, but I do think there\u2019s good alignment to it. And it\u2019s probably going to come more through deal than it is necessarily everyday value. I think we\u2019ve got a good everyday value platform embedded already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt DiFrisco</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There has been some reports about you guys closing some stores in China. I wonder \u2013 I know you guys don\u2019t give specific guidance for the year, but can you sort of at least help us understand how much exposure the MCD shareholders have to that market, whether that\u2019s in a worldwide revenue or your operating income?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, yes. Well obviously, the situation in China is fluid and it\u2019s concerning. Right now, as you would expect, our priority is really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we\u2019ve been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed, but 3,000 that are still open. We\u2019ve also, with the China team, we\u2019ve put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we\u2019re doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it\u2019s everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers in hospitals. We\u2019re doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it\u2019s really an \"all hands on deck\" effort from that vantage point. China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it\u2019s probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it\u2019s about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it\u2019s only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us and we\u2019re very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming, again, that it stays contained to China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sara Senatore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A question and also a follow-up please. So just on the outlook for G&amp;A, I think at the investor event last month, and certainly you reiterated just now, the sort of very case-specific reason to make acquisitions. But I mean, how should we think about tech spend going forward? I think the guidance for G&amp;A this year was a little bit higher than I would have expected. I know some of that is the owner/operator convention. Maybe you could quantify that? But just from the perspective of should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward, sort of in that mid-single-digit range, more similar to labor than to other investments just trying to anticipate that? And then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner/operator cash flow this year in the U.S. Does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address or are franchisees more looking to kind of protect that after having had a couple of years of declining cash flows?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alright. I\u2019ll talk about the G&amp;A first, and then I\u2019ll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&amp;A, a couple of points, we have talked about how we\u2019ve gotten more efficient with our day-to-day G&amp;A, and we\u2019re investing in technology and R&amp;D, so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente. And the things we\u2019re investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials. So that\u2019s how we think about kind of some of these specific investments. We have decreased our overall G&amp;A as a percent of sales from around 2.8% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2019. And roughly \u2013 today, roughly more than 10% of that G&amp;A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend, so a chunk of that G&amp;A is non-cash as it relates to prior year spend. We do \u2013 as you indicate, we expect full year G&amp;A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments. But that\u2019s \u2013 because I\u2019m lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we now will have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we\u2019ve talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. And then I guess, the only other thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019re in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&amp;A. But so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&amp;A long term. So we don\u2019t think about it any differently today than I did a couple of years ago. But I do have \u2013 obviously, to your point, we had an increase in \u201819, we have a little larger increase in \u201820. But certainly, we don\u2019t expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the point about or question about franchisee cash flow, it\u2019s exciting when you see the system set a record for franchisee cash flow. And in 2019, in the U.S., they did so in kind of a resounding way. I mean, they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another $50,000 or something like that. So it\u2019s a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business. Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant and some of the capital investments that we\u2019ve been doing, it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about. So to me, it\u2019s more about the point that our U.S. owner/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that\u2019s also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going. And so that\u2019s going to require staying aggressive on the business, and I\u2019m confident they\u2019re going to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry, Sara. The one other thing you asked about was convention, and I forgot about that, but convention \u2013 our operator convention that we have every other year is roughly $25 million to $30 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Bernstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the question as we think about the 2020 financial performance, Chris, I know you mentioned you\u2019re starting the year strong from a top line perspective. On the flip side, I guess, you\u2019re talking about maybe some elevated G&amp;A in the short term. So I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that in relation to your thoughts on achieving your long-term algorithm, which is for high single-digit EPS growth, I know you don\u2019t necessarily guide specifically to any one year, but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out, whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long-term growth. And within that, that return of cash that you mentioned, I know you finished your three-year target. I\u2019m just wondering whether, going forward, we should now just think of it as you\u2019re going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Let me hit \u2013 it\u2019s a couple of different things. Let me first talk about 2020. If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we\u2019ve given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020. Regarding cash return, we\u2019re fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a three-year period for cash return, but there is \u2013 but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Carril</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with so much attention focused on the morning daypart given the rollout of breakfast by a large competitor, how do you assess the opportunity to strengthen your competitive position in the other dayparts as breakfast becomes more of a focus for the industry?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think as you look at our business and you think about our 2020 plan, when I look at it, there is a good balance. I mean, we certainly have, I think, a pretty strong breakfast plan. We have a combination of menu news at breakfast. We have some service, things that we\u2019re really looking at driving at breakfast. And then certainly, we plan on remaining competitive from a value standpoint in breakfast. But there is a lot of other things that we still have on the calendar. And so if you think about a couple of years ago, we talked about really focusing on food and it was going to be a focus on burger, chicken and coffee. And I think you\u2019re going to see for us, in 2020, that there\u2019s going to be burger news, there\u2019s going to be things that we\u2019re doing there that continue to keep driving our QPC business, which really has been a standout performer for us the last couple of years. Obviously, a lot of discussion about chicken, don\u2019t want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there, but we\u2019re committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment, so you should expect something there. And then we do see opportunities as well around beverages, desserts. So as the year unfolds, I think you\u2019ll see us staying strong on breakfast, but it\u2019s not going to be at the expense of rest of day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dennis Geiger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just wondering if you could touch a bit more on operations and throughput and the opportunities there specific to drive-thru times, I think you touched on globally, perhaps how that\u2019s been progressing. So specifically in the U.S., maybe how much of an opportunity that is in 2020, and perhaps what part technology plays in improving the operations and those throughput times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Well, I think in the U.S., I\u2019m really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019. As we talked about in our comments, we\u2019re at record customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. driven by operations, and we\u2019re seeing it broad-based across a number of ops metrics that we\u2019re looking at. The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. But I think what we\u2019re also excited about is we think there\u2019s more that we can do there. We think that there\u2019s certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it\u2019s a combination of activities. It\u2019s a combination of menu simplification moves. It\u2019s a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We are doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. And then technology is a component to that. I\u2019d say right now, in 2020, I don\u2019t see technology necessarily being a huge part of what\u2019s going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service, rather. We have ZOOM timers, which is an internal thing that we use, that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thrus. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that\u2019s now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it\u2019s going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. Longer term, we\u2019re obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we\u2019ve done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we\u2019re able to get that commercialized and deployed, that\u2019s certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Cieplak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have time for one more question from Greg Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Francfort</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is kind of a two-parter. But just in terms of the check, I know I might be beating a dead horse here, but just can you quantify how much of that is spend per customer versus customers per ticket, as we try to think about maybe framing up like 7% check is not actually that much on a per customer basis? And then the other question, I know you just touched on it on chicken and you don\u2019t want to get into timing of new launches, but can you maybe talk about what your competitors are doing that McDonald \u2013 I guess, I would think that there\u2019s nothing that McDonald\u2019s couldn\u2019t replicate that your customers are doing. Is it a space constraint of getting new equipment? Is it getting the right flavors? Or is there something else that you\u2019re focused on in trying to improve the chicken quality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kevin Ozan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019ll cover the check real quick and then Chris can talk about chicken. A couple of things on check, so roughly right now, 60% of check is mix and 40% is pricing. And that\u2019s been relatively consistent, I\u2019ll say, throughout \u2013 I think we probably said roughly two-third, but it\u2019s in that range really throughout the year for 2019. We are seeing \u2013 in general, we\u2019re seeing a little bit higher customers per ticket. If you think about the way the business is evolving between things like delivery and the kiosks, we generally now have a little bit higher number of customers per ticket. So that is a piece of it. But even knowing that, we have been able to grow guest counts in many of our international markets, so I don\u2019t want to imply that, that would say that we should be able to grow guest counts in the U.S., the dynamics are changing, but we believe we can still grow guest counts even with those change in dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Chris Kempczinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on your chicken question, you\u2019re right, we have a very detailed and intimate understanding of what our competitors are doing there. I think, for us, it\u2019s really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants. And so that has an operations component. Our menu, as you know, is much more broad than some of our competitors. So that\u2019s something we need to be mindful of in terms of how \u2013 what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service. And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have. What we have been out testing \u2013 we are in a test right now, as you probably know. But we\u2019re testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint, but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint. So like anything with menu in McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s a little bit of a Rubik\u2019s cube of what\u2019s the customer looking for, what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that. But I think I feel good about where we\u2019re going to net add on chicken. I think we\u2019re getting close to having something that we\u2019re excited to bring to customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Cieplak</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Chris and Kevin and thank you everyone in joining the call today.
