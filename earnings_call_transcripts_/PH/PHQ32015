My name is Alex and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session toward the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Robin Davenport, Vice President, Corporate Finance. Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>Robin Davenport</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Alex. Good morning and welcome to Parker Hannifin\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings release teleconference. Joining me today is Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams; President and Chief Operating Officer, Lee Banks; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Marten.</p> <p>Today\u2019s presentation slides together with the audio webcast replay will be accessible on the company\u2019s investor information website at www.phstock.com for one year following today\u2019s call.</p> <p>On Slide 2, you\u2019ll find the company\u2019s Safe Harbor disclosure statement addressing forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for any reference to non-GAAP financial measures are included in this morning\u2019s press release and are posted on Parker\u2019s website, at www.phstock.com.</p> <p>Today\u2019s call agenda<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> appears on Slide 3. To begin, our Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams will provide highlights for the third quarter. And following Tom\u2019s comments, I\u2019ll provide a review of the company\u2019s third quarter performance together with the revised guidance for fiscal year 2015. Tom will provide a few summary comments and then we\u2019ll open the call for<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> a question-and-answer session.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So at this time, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom and ask that you refer to Slide #4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Thomas Williams</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Robin. And welcome to everybody on the call. We certainly appreciate your participation today and your interest in Parker. I\u2019ll take a few minutes to share our perspectives on the quarter, some near-term market trends and our outlook. Also we\u2019ll briefly discuss where we are in the process of refreshing our Win Strategy to take Parker\u2019s performance to the next level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, a few comments on our third quarter: Overall, we performed well, concerning an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment, which includes weaknesses in key end-markets and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Sales declined 6% this quarter primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency rates. We also saw order rates decline a minus 4% this quarter, first declines in orders since March of 2013.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite factors such as currency mix and end-market trends working against us, I am pleased we held total segment operating margins at 14.2%. This mostly reflects the benefits of restructuring activities we put in place previously and the ability of our businesses to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earnings per share were $2.02 per diluted share representing a 26% increase from the prior year third quarter. Adjusted for restructuring expenses, earnings were $2.06 per diluted share in the fiscal 2015 third quarter, an increase of 10% compared with adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.88 in fiscal 2014 third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year-to-date operating cash flow through the end of the third quarter was $791 million or 8.3% of the sales. We\u2019ve been active with our share repurchase program following our October announcement of our new authorization of the repurchase of $2 billion to $3 billion in shares in over two years. We remain committed to completing the share repurchase plan within that time period. To that end, we repurchased $477 million worth of Parker shares in the quarter, which brings our total for the fiscal year to-date to $1.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few comments on current market trends, the strong dollar and negative trends in construction, agriculture, and oil and gas impacted our third quarter fiscal year 2015 results. We continue to see positive trends in heavy-duty truck and long-term strength in our Aerospace business. And total organic growth was flat for the current quarter. And we\u2019ll provide you more details as we normally do during our Q&amp;A session.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding the guidance, declining order rates, combined with negative indicators at key end-markets and ongoing currency headwinds had influenced our outlook for the full fiscal year. Adjusted guidance has been revised to a range of $7.55 to $7.75 per diluted share and excludes $0.17 per diluted share of previously announced restructuring expenses and $0.13 per diluted share associated with the voluntary retirement program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe that our voluntary retirement program is a constructive first step towards our efforts to reduce overhead to the simplification of our business processes. We will further define our enterprise focus and efficiency initiatives in August. We see an opportunity to have a more efficient overhead structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While managing our business through these more immediate challenges we continue to focus on the long-term. As I referenced on the last call, the Win Strategy will continue as the business system, an overarching strategy for the company. However, now it\u2019s an opportune time to refresh the Win Strategy using input from key stakeholders. Our leadership team continues to spend time with Parker customers and employees globally as well as our shareholders and investors to shape our plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We intend to take the company\u2019s performance to the next level which we define as top quartile performance of among our diversified industrial peers. As the details to these plans are beginning to take shape I\u2019m encouraged by what I see. And the opportunities we have to improve performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Later this year, we will unveil greater detail on our future plans and we have scheduled an Investor Day in New York on November 3, to share more with investors. For now, I\u2019ll hand things back to Robin to few more details on the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robin Davenport</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Tom. At this time, please refer to Slide #5 and I will begin addressing earnings per share for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $2.06 versus $1.88 for the same quarter a year ago. This equates to an increase of $0.18 or 10%. This excludes the restructuring, which originally planned at $0.08 was actually $0.04 in the quarter and compares to $0.28 for the same quarter last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Slide 6, you\u2019ll find the significant components of the walk from adjusted earnings per share of $1.88 for the third quarter and fiscal year 2014 to $2.06 for the third quarter of this year. Income of $0.32 was realized in other, as a result of currency gains. The most significant portion is attributed to the un-pegging of the Swiss franc to the euro during the quarter. This resulted in an unexpected one-time intercompany settlement gain. Together with currency transaction gains realized from the netting of our international intercompany balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, the impact of fewer shares outstanding equated to an increase of $0.14 per share offsets to adjusted per share income included lower segment operating income $0.18 per share driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar currency translation, increased interest expense of $0.07. And higher comparative corporate G&amp;A that equated to $0.03 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Slide 7, with the review of total company\u2019s sales and segment operating margin, total company organic sales in the third quarter was flat at 0.02% over the same quarter last year. There was minimal contribution to sales in the quarter from acquisitions. Currency impact was higher than planned equating to a negative impact and reported sales of $205 million or 6.1% in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As shown on the bottom of this slide, total company\u2019s segment operating margins for the third quarter adjusted for restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were 14.4% versus 14.7% for the same quarter last year. Restructuring costs incurred in the quarter were $8 million, versus $60 million last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The lower adjusted segment operating income this quarter of $456 million, versus $494 million last year, reflects the meaningful impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar against foreign currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Slide 8, I\u2019ll discuss the business segments starting with Diversified Industrial North America. For the third quarter, North American organic sales were flat as compared to the same quarter last year. There was no impact from acquisitions and a negative impact from currency of 1.1% in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $237 million, as compared to $243 million driven by the impact of currency translation and unfavorable mix as a result of softening trends in key end-markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll continue with the Diversified Industrial segment on Slide 9. Organic sales for the quarter in the Industrial International segment decreased by 2%, while acquisitions made minimal contributions currency negatively impacted sales by 13.6%. Adjusting for restructuring costs operating margins for the third quarter were 12.7% as compared to 13.7% in the prior year which reflects the impact of the strengthened U.S. dollar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Restructuring expenses in the quarter were $7 million, as compared to $59 million in the prior year. I will now move to Slide 10 to review the Aerospace Systems segment. Organic revenues increased 5.7% for the quarter. With no impact from acquisitions currency posted a modest negative impact of 0.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The sales growth for the period was driven by higher commercial OEM and military aftermarket business. Operating margins for the quarter increased 120 basis points from 11.7% to 12.9%, due primarily to higher margin aftermarket sales volume and lower development costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now moving to Slide 11, with the detail of orders, changes by segment, just as a reminder, Parker orders represented trailing average and are reported as a percentage increase of absolute dollars year-over-year excluding acquisitions, divestitures in currency. The Diversified Industrial segments report on a three-month rolling average, while Aerospace Systems are based on a 12-month rolling average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total orders shifted to a negative 4% for the quarter end, reflecting the swift downturn in oil and gas, construction and agriculture, which represents three major industrial end-markets for Parker. Diversified Industrial North American orders for the current ended decreased to negative 6%. Diversified Industrial International orders decreased to negative 3% for the quarter. Aerospace systems orders decreased to negative 3% for the quarter, against notably high prior year comparable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 12, we review the cash flow from operations. Year-to-date, cash flow from operating activities was $791 million, or 8.3% of sales. The significant uses of cash in the third quarter were returns to our shareholders of $565 million. Share repurchases totaled $477 million and dividend payments were $88 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Slide 13, for the revised guidance for fiscal year 2015, guidance is being provided on an adjusted basis. Sales growth for the full year is adjusted for the joint venture with GE Aviation that commenced at the beginning of Q2 of fiscal 2014. Segment operating margins and earnings per share exclude restructuring charges and additional expense estimated for the voluntary retirement program to be incurred in Q4 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beginning with sales, total adjusted sales are expected to be in the range of a negative 4% to negative 3% as compared to the prior year. This is a reduction from previous guidance provided at the end of last quarter due to the negative impact our strengthened U.S. dollar, mainly the increase in the strength of the dollar versus the euro realized during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We calculated the impact of currency to spot rate as of March 31, 2015 and we have held those rates steady as we estimate the resulting year-over-year impact for the upcoming Q4 of 2015. Adjusted organic growth at the midpoint is just under 1% with minimal impact from acquisition carryover. Currency in the guidance negatively impacts sales by 4% which is nearly all related to Industrial International.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For total Parker adjusted segment operating margins are forecasted to be between 14.9% and 15.1%. This compares to 14.4% for fiscal year 2014 on an adjusted basis. The guidance for below the line items, which includes corporate administrative expenses, interest and other is $395 million for the year at the midpoint. This is lower than the previous guidance due to the third quarter favorable currency-driven adjustments. The full-year tax rate is projected at 26.5% which is a modest reduction from prior guidance. The average number of fully diluted shares outstanding used in the full-year guidance is 145.6 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on the topic of share repurchase as communicated during last quarter\u2019s earning call we remain committed to the $2 billion to $3 billion share repurchase announced in October. To-date share repurchases spent totaled 67% of the low end of the announced repurchase program and we anticipate that the balance of the commitment for repurchase will be made discretionarily over the remaining 18 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, revised guidance on an adjusted earnings per share basis is reduced to a range of $7.55 to $7.75 or $7.65 at the midpoint. This guidance excludes restructuring and voluntary retirement program expenses of approximately $60 million to be incurred in fiscal year 2015. The effect of this restructuring on EPS is approximately $0.30 for the full year, consisting of $0.17 for restructuring and $0.13 for voluntary retirement program expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the reduced projected restructuring expense previously guided savings of $23 million associated with the restructuring spend remains unchanged. Savings associated with the voluntary retirement program have not been forecasted for Q4 fiscal year 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 14 you\u2019ll find a reconciliation of the major components of our revised Q4 fiscal year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.86 from the prior guidance of $2.43 at the midpoint. Modest increases include $0.02 from a reduced tax rate and $0.01 from favorable reduced other expense. Key components of the decrease include a $0.38 reduction in segment operating income from translational currency resulting from the strengthened U.S. dollar and $0.22 reduction in segment operating income due to unfavorable mix and volume reduction as a result of the softening of the key end-market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please remember that forecasts excludes any acquisitions and divestitures that may be made during the fourth quarter. For consistency, we ask that you exclude restructuring expenses from your published estimates. Now this concludes my prepared comments. And Tom, I will turn the call back to you for your summary comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Thomas Williams</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Robin. As you can see, near-term challenges are shaping our immediate actions to respond to meet our financial commitments for this year. Longer term, we see a promising future and many opportunities to drive even higher levels of performance for Parker. I know there are many employees who call in to listen to this discussion and I\u2019d like to thank you for your efforts and express my appreciation for all of your hard work. I\u2019m very confident we can build on our past successes and continue to produce strong shareholder returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this time, we\u2019re ready to take questions. So, Alex, if you\u2019d like to give the instruction that will be great.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Josh.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just so, I guess, to parse out some of the end-market performance you guys mentioned, if you could just, I guess, first, comment on oil, and then if you had to think about the major drivers, whether it is de-stock in some of your broader distribution, oil weakness, or the strong US dollar impacting US manufacturing in general, if you could just kind of talk through some of those items and what you saw in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Josh. This is Lee. What I\u2019ll do if it\u2019s okay with you, I\u2019ll just kind of walk you through the different regions and give you some color. I think before we do that I don\u2019t want to be overly dramatic in any of these end-markets. Remember, currency was the big driver of top line here. So organically we were flat for the most part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So starting with North America, I think the headline story there that you mentioned is oil and gas. And for us it\u2019s really upstream land-based oil and gas. We\u2019ve seen a rapid decline in global oil prices which really led to a quick deceleration in CapEx across that sector. We\u2019ve notice that a big onshore rig utilization down year-over-year, which has put a lot of on some of the OEM customer servicing that sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So those OEM customers continue to build but at a much slower rate than they have in the past. Our MRO and services business continue to be okay. We\u2019re in touch with some of the OEM. First fit, it is down, where we\u2019ve got MRO opportunity, that kind of continues to be good and poses opportunities for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We talked about mining in the past that continues to be flat to down, we don\u2019t see a recovery there soon. I think one bright spot when the Americas really comes to the energy markets, we\u2019ve seen this around traditional and renewable power gen. There has been an accelerated de-commissioning and coal-fired power plants and what we have seen is an increase in gas-fired plants along with solar and wind capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So net-net, there\u2019s not new capacity being added but the switch has created some opportunity for us, not only on first fit but for our MRO distribution. And in concert with that, energy storage continues to gain momentum with battery technology advancing. We started a business unit in that area with some significant orders this quarters, so that\u2019s a real promising trend for us as we move forward. I think some other end markets in North America, heavy truck continues to be good. The line of sight we have for FY 2015 is strong with the backlog and from every indication we have FY 2016 continues to be very encouraging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Distribution in North America, I would say as a whole remains reasonably healthy. Now, that depends what distribution you touch and where it\u2019s really focused on oil and gas they\u2019ve seen softness. But on the flip side, there has been positive on the MRO markets really in plant automotive and energy. So year-over-year I would call it about neutral when it comes to North America distribution with some plusses and some minuses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, just turn into Europe. Europe by and large continues to tread water, I guess, is a good way of saying it. We did some see some volume in margin mix degradation in the quarter, really we saw that in agricultural business, truck, oil and gas and construction. We did have quite a few oil and gas projects moved out or pushed out which were bound for the Middle East, so hopefully those will come through in later quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have heard a lot of optimism from the export markets, significantly industrial machinery. We were just at the Hanover show. There is a lot of positive sentiment, but I\u2019ll be candid with you, we haven\u2019t seen that translate yet. So time will tell and see what happens there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Latin America, obviously being impacted by the recessions in Brazil and Argentina. Negative year-over-year growth in industrial production, we are seeing significant pullbacks in heavy truck, our large OEM customers, with plant shutdowns and workforce reductions. When it comes to offshore oil and gas in Latin America, really not much happening with what\u2019s happened with Petrobras. Some pre-salt projects have been postponed due to cash shortages and other issues. So MRO services are good, as I mentioned before, but year-over-year growth there is not there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly turning Asia, I guess the first conversation is about China. I continue to characterize that as slow industrial production growth year-over-year. Having said that, we do see positive impact in our distribution business. Some of this is growing municipal projects, but a lot of it has to do with just growing our distribution in general, so we get a little bit of benefit there. Some positives are medical equipment manufacturing, heavy truck, and power generation really run alternate energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve talked in the past about the contraction in construction equipment and mining, and if anything, that has taken a step down, it certainly hasn\u2019t gotten any better. And I would say lastly just talking about Asia that a bright spot is Southeast Asia continues to grow. It\u2019s a relatively small base for us, but growing quickly. A lot of infrastructure investment, agricultural investment in really energy. So all our people are - and teams are focused with our customers. This is a great opportunity for us to shine with these end markets when we have softness like this and it gives us a great opportunity to create more value for our end customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Lee. And I guess if I just had a one more follow-up on that, did you guys see any de-stock in the quarter anywhere? Any quantification that would be helpful and can you talk about the cadence and anything you are seeing into April?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Josh, this is Tom. We did see some de-stocking primarily like Lee was referring to distributors that would service those end markets that were the softest oil and gas, construction, ag, and that would be OEM channel, as well as distribution. I think it\u2019s going to take a couple quarters to play through. Obviously, we will stay close to it, stay close to our customers and our distributors and give you better insight in the August call. But I do think there is some more destocking that needs to play through, that\u2019s part of what you are seeing reflected in our updated guidance. And as far as current trends, the April trends, that\u2019s what\u2019s in our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gotcha. All right. Thanks, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning. I guess my question relates to, given the weakness that you are seeing in the market and as we\u2019re approaching 2016, both Tom and Lee, I know you went through some major restructuring actions sort of last year, is there anything sort of larger that you are contemplating right now, like another round of restructuring actions, just given the weakness that you are seeing in the markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then I guess just my second question is, given the weakness in the markets, are you seeing valuations come down on any acquisition opportunities and how you are thinking about acquisitions in light of weaker markets? Would you be more opportunistic, because that could potentially help 2016? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Jamie, it\u2019s Tom. I\u2019ll try to address both of those. First, on the restructuring, you saw that we announced $0.13 for a voluntary retirement program. And that\u2019s an initial first step we\u2019re looking at is really enterprise focus and efficiency. It\u2019s really a new initiative or a continuing initiative to focus on improving our overhead costs, the overhead burden to the company, so we\u2019re working on that. You\u2019ll get more insights on the details of that in the August call, but this was an initial first step. We thought it was a constructive first step offering a voluntary retirement program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do think there is extra efficiencies we can get through our overhead structure, so that would be one aspect of it. Certainly, in the near term, we are doing the normal, run the business adjustments that we would normally do with short works, reducing temps, all those kind of things. But the retirement program and the overhead efficiencies is an additional step on top of the market adjustments we will be making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the acquisition side, haven\u2019t seen valuations turn down yet, but we are very active and we\u2019ve got reviews going monthly, reviews going quarterly with all the groups. We are starting to see activity pick up. Our desire is just like it has been historically to have 4 to 5 points of growth via acquisitions. You are right; in today\u2019s climate with softness in end markets, this is an opportune time for us to add the acquisitions and we\u2019ve got a great track record historically of being the consolidator of choice within our space and we are going to continue that. So we are very interested. Acquisitions are - it\u2019s hard to predict. They are lumpy in nature as far as coming out of the pipeline, but the activity is certainly there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And sorry, just one follow-up on the portfolio. Are you considering - are you and Lee both considering any, as you look at Parker\u2019s organic growth, I would say investors have been disappointed over the past couple of years. A lot of it is macro, I get that, but are you considering any portfolio changes within Parker, any potential divestitures of sort of lower growth or commoditized businesses, or is that off the table?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I mean, I would say a couple things on the growth side. One, we always look at portfolio continuously through the business cycle. And you\u2019ve seen us in the past make adjustments, so that\u2019s something we always take a look at and there is nothing major at this point, but we always look at it and certainly we would update you if we had any changes. But on the gross side, in addition to acquisitions, Lee touched on a little bit at the end of his end markets, this is a great time for us to take share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are only 11% share of the total motion control space, and we\u2019ve got all of our teams around the world focused on trying to gain share by account by account, market by market, so that would be one aspect of it. The other part is, we\u2019ve rolled out a new growth incentive plan starting this year with the full impact of that being next year and it\u2019s a growth multiplier on top of our annual incentive plan, which is the RONA plan, which some of you may be familiar with our RONA plan, which is done division by division, goes all the way from the general manager down to the operator on the floor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But what we\u2019ve added is an incentive, if you grow faster than the market, and we are defined on the market as the median of our proxy peers, there is an additional kicker to your RONA and a very nice kicker that really accelerates and encourages growth, but also if you grow slower than the market, there is a negative consequence where there is actually a deduct to your annual incentive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think that comes into full play next year, so I think that will drive the right kind of behavior incentive. And I think you are familiar with our - the key things we are going after with the Win Strategy on growth, those continue. But I think the other aspect would be services. Our e-business, the Parker.com channel, while very young as far as from a commercial standpoint, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress the team has made there. We have a much better - from a customer friendliness standpoint and feedback. That website has improved dramatically, so attracting, finding, helping customers buy a product and then service them I think our website has clearly improved dramatically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that in addition to other service things on the asset integrity and part tracking, so there\u2019s a number of things besides I will call the traditional growth playbook that we are doing to help grow organically. But right now, I would love to do more acquisitions and we\u2019re certainly going to focus on that as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thanks. I will get back in queue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Did any of the verticals that we talked about, did that - any of them actually sequentially improve, or was this a matter of ag, construction, oil and gas got bad and the others also sort of softened, but just softened by less? And I guess if you could parse your answer in both North America and Europe, that would be great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, this is Lee. I would say sequentially improved. Heavy trucks in the transportation improved sequentially. Power generation sequentially and these are really North America-centric what I\u2019m giving you right now. There are some smaller ones here, semiconductor sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say flat would be areas like process industries had been flat sequentially. Rail has been flat sequentially, and I think that has to do probably with what\u2019s happening with the oil markets right now, and then areas like forestry. What has been negative sequentially are areas that we talked about, oil and gas, mining to name a couple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Lee, would that read through in terms of what you just described, also would that map to your orders? In other words, you are sort of giving me the trend in the quarter; what about the mapping to the orders? Was there any differences there or would you (multiple speakers)?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, I would say that is pretty consistent with the order trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that I\u2019m assuming is North America. What about Europe? You are a big company in Europe. Did you find similar trends, or is it a little bit different?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say similar. Distribution was okay. That\u2019s really driven by MRO sequentially in Europe, machine tools was up. I\u2019m always careful, because when we talk sequentially, I\u2019m talking about our Q2 versus Q3, Q2 is such a soft quarter. So I don\u2019t want to make too much of these sequential numbers, if that makes sense to you, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, well, I was trying to put into a context of what you normally would have expected to see sequentially considering, to your point, you\u2019ve got some seasonality and year-over-year comparison, so I think I get it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sequentially, we would always want to see Q3 bigger than Q2 I think, which was really - which we didn\u2019t expect was the deceleration in upstream oil and gas. We would not have expected that going into Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you have said oil and gas is 6% of the company. The one thing, of course, that we knew was going to happen not pertaining to Parker specifically was the derivative impact of oil-producing states like Texas, the Dakotas, et cetera. I mean, is that what you also realized, so directly it was 6%, but the indirect perhaps was more broadly felt and is there any way to kind of put a handle around that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely, the derivatives of oil and gas had a negative impact. It is really hard to attach a number to it. We work hard to attach the 6% oil and gas, so they try and get all the periphery industries is difficult, but you could definitely see it throughout the markets in the channel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe just one last one, if these trends don\u2019t really change much, which could be a scenario, as we roll into 2016, the one thing that seems striking is that there is going to be some relatively tough compares right, in the September and December quarters for 2016 and then, of course, we\u2019ve got global line stuff this quarter. Is there any reason to think that 2016 the first-half is actually going to improve versus the current trend based on your thinking today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, John. On 2016 is probably too early for us to comment. We\u2019re just now starting to roll up numbers for 2016, and we haven\u2019t even had our initial meetings. So what we\u2019ve got in our guidance and the comments we\u2019ve made are Q4. I did mention obviously the de-stocking we thought will continue for a couple quarters, but it\u2019s too early for us to give you an input for 2016, and we\u2019ll certainly give you a lot of detail when we do the August update.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Got it. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eli Lustgarten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Eli.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eli Lustgarten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can we get a little bit into the fourth-quarter guidance because, when I look at it, if I\u2019m interpreting correctly, the North American sales decline is in line with the order decline at the mid-single digit, but it looks like the diversified rest of the world international has a huge decline and I assume when you start talking 20% plus, you start talking about at least 15% plus is currency and then it\u2019s a bigger decline than the order weakness we saw. So it just looks like there is a very, very weak fourth quarter coming in international. Can you give us some color on what is going on in the two markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Eli, you are right, I mean, the significant driver, probably two-thirds of that is related to the currency translation. Likewise, we are also seeing that there is unfavorable mix and some volume impact as reflected through the orders as well as a result of this softness in the key end markets. So those are really the primary things that are going on with the change in revenues and then the follow-on impact on the operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eli Lustgarten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it is a very, very weak international quarter that is coming, particularly versus a tough comparison last year. Is that fair?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly, but again a big part of that is on the currency translation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eli Lustgarten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And can you talk a bit about what\u2019s happening in pricing across the marketplace, both here and particularly outside North America on the products? I mean, there\u2019s not much inflation, but in these kind of demand scenarios, it seems that pricing is going to get a bit complicated across the board. You guys do better in pricing than anybody else in the industry, but can you give us some idea of what you are facing at this point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Eli, it\u2019s Lee. I would say pricing, it\u2019s a challenging environment to say the least with the - with currency movements, et cetera. Having said that, net-net, we still are positive year-over- year from a currency standpoint - but I mean from a pricing standpoint, but it is something that we work regionally and through all our channels every single week and every single day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eli Lustgarten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess the assumption is that this fourth quarter is going to be tough. And you don\u2019t expect much business conditions other than seasonally and maybe into some restocking as we go - as we enter the second-half of calendar 2015. Is that a fair way of characterizing what is going on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s a fair way of characterizing it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eli Lustgarten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. All right.

Is it certain end markets or weaker distribution? And are you - did you see that in the quarter and in the order outlook?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, yes, Jeff, it basically links back to the key end markets that we talked about where we saw that softening, so ag, construction and oil and gas. So those are the big impacters there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Hammond</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So those just have better mix ultimately and so that\u2019s driving the negative mix in the margins?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly on the oil and gas side in particular, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Hammond</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Is there a way to quantify kind of the magnitude of these order declines in those three markets you called out, I mean, are we seeing like down 15% to 20%, or\u2026?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff, this is Jon. In terms of the magnitude of the order decline again, I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things that are going on here. The first one we\u2019ve talked about, oil and gas and we\u2019ve talked about ag. These are relatively small parts of our - of the total company, and the decline that we\u2019ve seen there is in line with what we\u2019ve seen with the macro conditions around the world. We\u2019re not really in a position to be able to give you an exact number, but they were material enough that we thought that we should just make sure that we mentioned it to give you additional color.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So they\u2019ve impacted things and as Lee and Tom have talked about, there have been other markets that have been strengthening, including aerospace and heavy-duty truck. And, again, when we\u2019re talking about what we are seeing internationally, of course, keep in mind that when we\u2019re giving guidance, we\u2019re using the currency rate at March - at the end of March. And so that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s happening with those end markets. It\u2019s not the contraction of them, it is the impact that we are seeing from currency due to the sharp decline, in terms of the increased strength of the dollar here for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Hammond</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just - go ahead. So just finally on the M&amp;A pipeline, it still sounds pretty lean, so maybe just speak to kind of the bias on buyback given kind of the lean M&amp;A. Does that kind of bias you towards that high end of the $2 billion to $3 billion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff, this is Tom. We are committed to the $2 billion to $3 billion. I would say that our preference is we would really like to do more acquisitions. The output right now, we haven\u2019t had any output - but the activity is increasing significantly within the company. The cadence around it, and the number of properties that we are looking at are all increasing, so I\u2019m encouraged by that. Like I mentioned earlier, it is lumpy and it\u2019s hard to predict the output, but our goal is to still have acquisitions 4% to 5%. So that being said, the ideal mix would be we would do $2 billion approximately of the share repurchase in the billion of acquisitions over that time period that we announced. But if the acquisitions do not materialize then we will make up the difference with a share repurchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Joe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tom, your comment on overhead simplification I thought was interesting. I went back and did some analysis and looked at the past 20 years. I noticed just as a percentage of sales that you really hadn\u2019t seen much of a change in your corporate expense again as a percentage of sales. And just given the amount of growth that you\u2019ve had in the business, I would\u2019ve assumed that there was a little bit more operating leverage. And so I am just curious, how are you thinking about the aspirational target on what you can do on the simplification side to get your cost structure down?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and we do have very much - we have a keen interest in this area, we are looking at overheads across the entire company, so it would be corporate at the group level and at the divisions and looking at it in aggregate and it\u2019s really all about trying to simplify the company, have it more focused, have it be more efficient to have less of an overhead burn for every dollar of revenue that we take into the company. This is going to take multiple reviews internally, we have a number of them happening in May and June, so it\u2019s early days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The early retirement, we felt was a really constructive first step that would be attractive to potential employees, as we try to move towards becoming more efficient from an overhead structure, even more efficient. I would say we have done historically a pretty good job there, but I think as a team collectively we are looking for opportunities to do better there. So I am not ready to give you what we think is going to come out of that, but we will in August. We will give you the details of what we think we are going to yield from this and then of course what the potential cost might be there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. I guess maybe one follow-up question on the margin ramp, especially in aero, in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just curious like whether there is any one-time items that are really going to benefit the margins in the quarter. I know that last year you had about a 350 basis point benefit from a claims settlement and so it looks like the margin guidance implies a pretty significant ramp. I am just curious if there\u2019s - what is driving that ramp in 4Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Joe, Jon here. I think the ramp in Q4 is something that we\u2019ve seen historically. You are right, this time last year, there was a significant settlement on a few contracts. We typically are negotiating all year long and quite often, we will able to settle some outstanding either assertions that we have or issues that come up between ourselves and our suppliers, or our customers and so we have seen that pattern in last few years. There is not one particular thing though that is driving this result that we are seeing in Q4 as part of our guidance. It is more of a general bottoms-up review of each one of the operations and this is what we came out here, which will continue to bode well for us going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And maybe one last question on the restructuring benefits. What are you guys expecting for the benefits in 4Q and how do we think about 2016 at this point given all the restructuring actions you have taken thus far year-to-date?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we want to - we have an estimate in for Q4 for the restructuring as it relates to the voluntary retirement program. We want to - before we commit to a savings number, we want to roll up all of the FY 2016 and we want to make sure that we understand who and how the take-up rate on the program is executed during the quarter. And so we won\u2019t know that, until we come out with our update in August, so we won\u2019t be able to give you a really good idea of something that is factual until August. And at that time, we will be very detailed in terms of what we expect in terms of the savings from the voluntary retirement program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.

Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mig Dobre</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Mig.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mig Dobre</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sticking with international, one of the things that really surprised me is really your updated guidance. You have reduced your margin guidance by 150 basis points for fiscal 2016 after only one quarter, if you would, worth of changes in terms of end markets in the environment. This is well below your 15% target after roughly two years of restructuring. So If or one am a little bit confused as to how I should be thinking about sustainable margins for this business going forward. Any help here would be great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two-thirds of the reduction in the guidance internationally relates to what we are seeing from a currency standpoint. Now we have seen such sharp currency trends that it takes - there\u2019s a matter of timing that is involved here, Mig. We are very optimistic long term. We will be back up at the 15% plus rate that we expect from those operations, but there is a timing issue where we\u2019ve got to make sure that we are keeping up with the trends in the marketplace. So that\u2019s about two-thirds of what is happening with the international margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other one-third of it is really being impacted by what we are seeing on the ground in some of the end markets that Lee and Tom talked about those end markets that they called out are unfortunately for us having an impact on the mix and because of that, that mix issue, what we are seeing a very slight degradation for us in those margins. Historically, over the years, our margins for international as reflected in our guidance is 13.4%, and we are really seeing a slow ramp up to the 15% that we were talking about this time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All the savings that we are getting from the very successful restructuring program that we executed on last year are just being masked by what we are seeing in the currency and then these new trends and some of these end markets. So we are not backing off our determination to make those businesses 15% plus going forward here. It is just a confluence of events and that is really impacting us. And like I say, almost two-thirds of it clearly related just to the currency and the impact there as the strong dollar impacts the translation of our earnings outside the U.S. into our income statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mig Dobre</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, I appreciate that. Then it is fair to say basically as we are looking out that we should be thinking about currency impact really as well as mix and maybe try to think about scaling up margins as these effects become diminished as fiscal 2016 would progress. Is that a fair way to think about it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think so, yes. I think that is very, very, very true.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mig Dobre</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. And then my last question is on aerospace. An order decline here, and your orders are on an LTM basis, I think this is the first decline since the Great Recession. Can this business grow in the next 12 months?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Mig. Absolutely. Please do not read too much into that. We were - had a bad comps here for this quarter. We\u2019ve got built-in growth rates due to all of our wins in excess of 5% per year and that has not changed. There was a significant - we were up mid-double digits this time last year. A lot of those orders related to FY 2016 again because of the long term nature of the business. So I can go through that with you in more detail, but we are not concerned about the impact of those order rates on the long term. We still feel very confident in our long term growth assumptions that we\u2019ve come out with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mig Dobre</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mig.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nathan Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Nathan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nathan Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just following up on the last caller, you talked about a timing issue on international margins related to FX. Can you talk about how long that takes to get through before we will start to see improvement there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We - it will take a quarter or two is what our estimates are. This is something that we are all working very hard around the world to make sure that we are reacting to. But as you know very well, Nathan, I mean to take the euro down to $1.06 for us at the end of March, that, as well as the strength of the dollar versus almost all other currencies, that has had an impact on us. And in some cases we have - not in all - but in some cases we need to make very quick turns and pivots in terms of our pricing and we are working on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nathan Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then obviously some different drivers this time, but some of the data starting to look a little bit like your 2012, 2013 numbers. We saw four quarters of mid-single digit order declines there, margins compressed about 200 basis points. Is there some reason why we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about that as a base case scenario going forward over the next 12 months?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Marten</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think the answer to that is we should not expect that as a base case. I think that what is different, the successful massive restructuring that we did last year, that is bleeding over into expected future margins that we are going to see, a program that Tom outlined in terms of our overhead efficiency that is going to make us even more efficient going forward and our ability to grow in markets that we are not talking about too much on this call that is really going to help us in the out period. So I am very, very optimistic about us going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are certainly going to see an increase in our aerospace margins as time goes on also. And because of the actions that we took in Europe, because of the markets that will continue to grow in North America and because of the aerospace segment actions and wins that we took a few years ago, I don\u2019t feel like we are going to see a repeat of that time period, so kind of a long-winded answer, Nathan, but wanted to be responsive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nathan Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And one more, you did talk about industrial machinery exports potentially improving in Europe with them becoming more competitive with lower currency. Have you started to see any impact in Europe from the lower currency over there making European economies more competitive? Any greenshoots of that or any expectation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lee Banks</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nathan, it\u2019s Lee. I\u2019m not ready to say that at this point in time. There\u2019s certainly a lot of hope and a lot of conversation, but to see strong evidence of that, I can\u2019t see that yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nathan Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Nathan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[indiscernible] in, how are you doing, guys?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Joel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just have - a lot has been asked and you guys have been great about answering everything. I just wondered if you guys share the historic view that the aerospace is a little bit too small of a percent of the whole company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Joel. It\u2019s Tom. Ideally, we would like to get aerospace to be 20% of the portfolio. Today, it runs around 15% or 16%. So we would like it to be a bigger piece it acts as a counter cycle to the shorter cycle industrial part. It shares all common technologies across the company. There\u2019s parts of it that we would really like to build out, which I won\u2019t necessarily say publicly because I don\u2019t want to tip my hand as far as what we might want to be investing in, but there\u2019s a lot of it that we very much would like to build out and the aerospace team is working that as we speak, both organically and through acquisitions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And is it safe to assume that there is nothing really big in the acquisition pipeline, or else you guys would balance the share repurchase and the acquisitions a little more?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Joel, it\u2019s Tom again. The pipeline is getting more active, and - I\u2019ll probably never be happy with the volume there, but it is getting more active, so I\u2019m pleased with that. Our sweet spot will continue to be in the $30 million to $300 million revenue range. That being said, we are a big company. We could do a bigger acquisition, but I think you will see us - the majority of activity is going to be in our traditional wheelhouse as far as revenue size.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the last one, I just wondered why not top decile instead of top quartile? Is there anything from what you see today and what you\u2019ve seen historically that makes it more realistic to reach for the top quartile instead of the top decile of industrial profitability?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Tom again. Are you talking about top 10% versus top 25%, that is your?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, yes. You guys have been in the top 25% probably for most of the last decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. When we look at - it is against our proxy peers is what we are comparing to and it\u2019s a pretty competitive group and there are some metrics where we are not in the top quartile where we would like to get into the top quartile and when we give you the Win Strategy refresh November 3 for the Investor Day, we\u2019re going to give you a vision of where we would like to take the company and that will include some metric expectations and give you an idea how and how long it will take us to get there. The bottom line is we think we can take - the company has done extremely well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Win Strategy has been really a unifying document for the company, a defining strategy, but we think there is an opportunity to take it to the next level, which in turn will take the total company to the next level. And I can just tell you for everybody on the phone as well we\u2019ve gotten - both Lee and I have gotten tremendous interest and participation as we\u2019ve been going around talking to our employees about the new Win Strategy and there\u2019s lots of good ideas and we are encouraged by what we are hearing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Joel. And Alex, I think we will take one more call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Your last question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Just slipped in, so just one quick detail maybe, Robin. The gain in Switzerland, how much was that exactly?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robin Davenport</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That was $0.19 attributed to the gain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">$0.19. Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Tom, I think it was you in the initial comments talked about refreshing the Win Strategy and I guess you are going to try to sketch that out in more detail, but I am going to just see if I can get a little bit of a preview. Traditionally, we have had kind of pricing and lean and sourcing as sort of the key levers in Win Strategy. Are we adding additional levers, do we think there\u2019s a lot more room in the existing levers? Just give us a sense of how you think about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it is early for me to try to give you that, but I think the essence of why we are calling it the refresh, you\u2019re not going to see a sharp turn to the right as far as on the Win Strategy, it\u2019s going to be building on top of it. So I think it will be a combination of enhancements to the existing strategy and few new ones that we will put on there. And I think it\u2019s the combination, really the vision - there\u2019s a couple visions here. One, to be a top quartile diversified industrial company and that\u2019s kind of the overarching one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second is to an even stronger number one in our space, so we are only 11% share. If you looked in the back of the Win Strategy, we have always had a vision historically to be 20% market share. That would put us at a $20 billion company and that\u2019s - I mean that\u2019s the other part of it. So initiatives on how to get to be in top quartile and how to be significantly bigger - being significantly bigger number one - is going to frame the Win Strategy refresh.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So is it safe to say win 2.0 is more focused on growth than on margin?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Thomas Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say it is always going to be balanced, you have to do both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. I appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robin Davenport</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks so much, Steve. So this concludes our Q&amp;A and earnings call. I\u2019d like to thank you for joining us today. Todd and I will be available throughout the remainder of the day to take your calls should you have any further questions. And once again thank you and have a great day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.
