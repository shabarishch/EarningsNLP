Good day everyone and welcome to The Boeing Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation, plus the analyst question-and-answer session are being broadcast live over the internet. [Operator Instructions]</p> <p>At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Matt Welch, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Boeing Company. Mr. Welch, please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Matt Welch</strong></p> <p>Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. I am Matt Welch and with me today are Dave Calhoun, Boeing\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian West, Boeing\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And as a reminder, you can follow today\u2019s broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.</p> <p>As always, we have provided detailed financial information in our press release issued earlier today. Projections, estimates and goals we include in our discussions this morning involve risks, including those described in our SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of the web presentation. In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures.</p> <p>Now, I will<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> turn the call over to Dave Calhoun.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Dave Calhoun</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Yes. Thanks, Matt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Just upfront, we\u2019ve changed in this format just a bit so that I can limit my remarks upfront to some observations and thoughts with respect to where we are in this rebuilding process. And then, Brian will take you into<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> more detail on the financial side.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to the environment, there\u2019s no doubt Omicron has paused the industry recovery. But it has not changed the outlook for the industry recovery, such that while it might be delayed a few more months, the bookings and the customer discussions with respect to fleet plans, medium and long term, are still quite robust. And we are quite confident in that outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2021 I would characterize for Boeing as a rebuilding year. We came from recovery to rebuilding. And I give our team a lot of credit for, frankly, making a lot of progress on that front. Number one, on the orders front and demand, particularly led by the MAX and the freighter market, I feel very good about where things are and the competitiveness of our product line with respect to that market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Supply constraints to date have not constrained us. On the other hand, I think in the medium to long-term future, it\u2019s something we all have to plan for. I\u2019ve always viewed the unfortunate means by which we got here and the buildup of finished goods inventory, both with respect to the MAX and the 787, as sort of a double-edged sword. I hate that we have a lot of inventory. On the other hand, it will probably serve us well in what is likely to be a robust recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to fleet rebuilding, I would also just like to highlight the efficiency gains and maybe even more importantly, the emissions gains that our customers enjoy when they replace their current fleet with these new aircraft are significant, and the pressures are severe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think that creates some additive pressure with respect to fleet renewals as we move forward. And I don\u2019t think either of those will let up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The MAX return to service. I\u2019m quite proud of where we are on that. We have regulatory approval now in almost every jurisdiction in the world. You know that China, Indonesia and Ethiopia all delivered prior to the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered 245 airplanes in \u201821. We\u2019ve flown safely over 800,000 flight hours, 99.3% service reliability. And we\u2019ve now flown more post the MAX grounding than we did pre-MAX grounding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">China is preparing for their MAX return to service and for delivery. And we have set up a plan that allows for that in the first quarter. But of course, they\u2019ll take them as the government returns the current fleet to service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our customers are moving methodically and very well with respect to that return to service. 87, very unfortunate charge that we took here in the fourth quarter. It reflects everything we\u2019ve learned about the rework process itself, the data required to restart deliveries and obtain ticketing and then customer expectations regarding concessions as we move forward. With all that said, I still feel fantastic about the future of the 787 airplane for The Boeing Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And anyway, as I think I point out every time we get together, these 87s today, the field -- the fleet and service is flying, is more utilized than any other widebody airplane. 99% of it is in service today with respect to the pre-pandemic levels. And it\u2019s the most utilized widebody out there, 98.99% reliability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, this is a great product line and a competitive product. And as soon as we begin delivery, we feel very good about the ultimate recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On BDS, we did hit a bunch of really important milestones. The MQ-25, we experienced our first refueling, and we began carrier tests. The T-7A production line, which is based on significantly improved development process and engineering modeling capabilities, is off to a very good start, and the efficiency associated with that development process is being realized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, the tanker. The tanker today, despite the charge, again, which we don\u2019t feel great about by any respect, but the tanker today is an incredible asset for our customer and now serves 70% of the missions that were intended in the development of the tanker. And our job is to continue to deliver the tanker and to do it more expeditiously as we move forward. The good news is our customer likes the performance of the airplane. And again, we intend to serve that need.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Global Services, it is recovering like all the service businesses that surround aviation. It\u2019s on a great path. The team is doing a terrific job. We had a small write-off with respect to materials that ultimately would not be utilized in this recovery. But BGS is doing quite well, and is experiencing the recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, I feel very good about the free cash flow that we generated in the fourth quarter. As everybody knows, we have been focused relentlessly on improving our free cash flow situation. It has been our number one metric. And to be able to achieve that I think is terrific news.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sustainability, it is the one issue every customer wants to talk to us about, not with respect to 2050 or 2035, but they want to make sure that we have a program in place that will support them over that time frame, and it is very important to the every next order that we achieve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, believe it or not, the competition for today\u2019s airplanes is often built around the future plans that we have with respect to sustainability. And I love where we\u2019re going on that and the story we -- that we have for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Innovation is strong in every way. I mentioned the MQ-25, the T-7A. Future capabilities with respect to the next development program, we\u2019ve invested a lot. We continue to invest a lot. It\u2019s more important to me that we get our development tools where they need to be, demonstrate manufacturing capability and capacity where we need to be before we call out the spec on the next new commercial airplane. So, I remain focused on that as a priority, and so far, so good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Talent, we were stable over the course of \u201821. Turnover was managed I think quite well and quite aggressively. And so, I feel good about that and our ability to hire as we move forward. But, I will also acknowledge that there are shortages out there in critical skills, and we have to be very competitive in order to get them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll highlight the priorities we have. I don\u2019t think any of them should surprise anybody. They may look boring with respect to words like stability, safety, quality management. But that is still our focus, and we\u2019re going to be relentless about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is a very important year as we begin the year and then exit the year where we can predict to customers and to all of you the deliveries of our airplanes and ensure the quality is what it needs to be, et cetera. And culturally, our team is getting closer to their work than they\u2019ve ever been. We feel good about that. And we invest. We\u2019re investing heavily in the future capabilities of our Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that\u2019s it with respect to my upfront comments. I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian. We can go through the quarter\u2019s performance and then a little more time for Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brian West</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2021 was a year of recovery for our business. We\u2019re optimistic about how we\u2019re positioned entering into 2022 and have high confidence in the long-term strength of the Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain focused on solidifying our business for long-term success. The lessons we\u2019ve learned and the changes we\u2019ve implemented in the last two years will help us to do that. We\u2019re driving safety, quality, stability into every corner of our operations to enable future growth. And we made solid progress against our goals over the last three months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In particular, as Dave mentioned, we\u2019re proceeding to get 737 MAX airplanes ready to deliver in China as early as the first quarter and follow the lead of our customers and regulators on next steps. On the 787, while we can\u2019t predict when deliveries will restart, we have made meaningful strides in addressing many of the non-conformances we identified. We have work remaining to do, and we continue to hold detailed productive discussions with the FAA every step of the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking to our financials. Despite some of the near-term challenges, we generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and believe free cash flow will continue to materially improve this year and into 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With this backdrop, we think of 2022 in three parts. First, we\u2019ll focus on reaching key milestones so that we can resume 737 deliveries to Chinese customers and restart 787 deliveries. Then, once we achieve these important milestones, we expect to see improvement in our performance metrics, including deliveries, revenue, margin and cash flow. And we intend to come back to you with detailed plans for the rest of the year and beyond. Finally, as we move through the second half of the year, our financial performance should start to accelerate. And we think there is a significant opportunity ahead for our Company return to sustainable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net-net, we\u2019re well positioned at the start of the year and encouraged by the hope of a return to normalcy in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I get into the detailed financial results, I want to make a few points on the current environment on slide 4. Let\u2019s start with the demand side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the commercial market, we continue to see an overall broadening of the recovery starting with domestic traffic, which rebounded to around 90% of prepandemic levels in countries such as the U.S. and Brazil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the U.S., domestic traffic nearly fully recovered at 94% of pre-COVID levels in November. December data suggests resilient traffic despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, but early 2022 bookings data indicate a more visible negative impact likely extending through February. Beyond that, we expect the recovery for the spring and summer seasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Outside of the U.S., the recovery continues broadening in Europe and South America. However, further lockdowns have stagnated recovery in China, where we have seen traffic decrease considerably. Despite some near-term volatility, we\u2019re encouraged by airlines\u2019 plans for the spring and summer travel seasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the international front, traffic has improved throughout the year from more than 85% below 2019 levels to 60% as the year ended with a meaningful benefit from reopening of borders and lifting of travel restrictions. In particular, the transatlantic corridor showed improvement due to coordinated travel policies between the EU and the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The commercial freighter market continues to be robust with 2021 cargo traffic 7% above prepandemic levels. We saw record freighter demand last year driven by both e-commerce growth and demand for faster, more reliable transport that airfreight can provide. And we\u2019re seeing the same steady recovery broadly in our commercial services business as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given this demand recovery, our customers are increasingly focused on their medium-term flight planning and continue to prioritize fleet modernization as an enabler to reduce carbon emissions and increase operating efficiency. New airplanes we deliver will be as much as 25% to 40% more fuel efficient with commensurate reductions in emissions compared to the airplanes they replace. And as oil prices remain high, our customers are keenly aware of these benefits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, our projections for the three-phase commercial market recovery remain unchanged, and we still assume pass-through traffic will return to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. We continue to see domestic traffic lead the recovery followed by intra-regional and then long-haul international routes. Long-term fundamentals that support demand for air traffic remain intact as we continue to project average traffic growth of mid-single digits over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the defense and space markets, we\u2019re seeing stable demand. We continue to monitor the federal budget process in the U.S. and see strong bipartisan support for national security, including Boeing products and services. While governments around the world remain focused on COVID-19, security spending remains a priority given global threats.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the supply side, with our production at relatively low rates and higher-than-normal inventory levels, the supply chain is currently not a constraint. However, as we look forward to the industry recovering and future production rate increases, our supply chain remains a key watch item due to raw material and labor availability as well as logistical challenges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We regularly monitor supplier health and have risk mitigation plans in place for critical components. As we prepare for future rate production increases, we will continue to prioritize operational stability across the value stream. Long term, the markets we serve are robust, and we remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and the growth of the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let\u2019s turn to the financials on page 5 -- slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue of $14.8 billion declined 3%. And the core operating loss in the quarter was $4.5 billion, resulting in a $7.69 loss per share. We generated positive operating cash flow of over $700 million in the fourth quarter, driven by 737 deliveries and favorable receipt timing in BDS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now look to Commercial Airplanes on slide 6. Commercial order activity picked up significantly in 2021 as airlines are positioning for the recovery, particularly in the narrowbody and freighter markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In total for the year, we booked 909 gross Commercial Airplane orders, including 749 orders for the 737 MAX. We also booked a record number of orders on our freighter airplanes. And we ended the year with 11 straight months of positive net orders. We appreciate every order from our broad customer base, including United, Southwest, Alaska, UPS and FedEx. We are also honored that Akasa, Allegiant and 777 partners recently selected Boeing to support their future fleets. We had over 4,200 airplanes in backlog at the end of 2021 valued at $297 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fourth quarter revenue was $4.8 billion, essentially flat, primarily driven by higher 737 deliveries, partially offset by lower widebody deliveries and less favorable mix. Operating losses of $4.5 billion were primarily driven by charges on the 787 program, resulting in a negative margin rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">787 deliveries remain paused, and we had 110 airplanes in inventory at the end of the quarter. As you know, last year, we set out on a comprehensive program to ensure every 787 airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications. We resolved many of the non-conformances and, we\u2019re finalizing our work on the remaining items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also continue to focus on fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the FAA, and we\u2019ll follow their lead on the timing of resuming deliveries. While this effort has inevitably impacted our deliveries to customers and our near-term financial performance, we are fully confident is the right thing to do for our future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, we determined that the activities required to resume deliveries and the rework that will be needed on each airplane and inventory will take longer than previously expected, resulting in further delays in customer delivery dates. We regret the impact these delays have had on our customers and are working closely with each of them to support their fleet planning needs. Consequently, we\u2019re producing at very low rates, and we\u2019ll continue to do so until deliveries resume, gradually returning to five airplanes per month over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a financial impact standpoint, we now anticipate 787 abnormal costs will be approximately $2 billion, with most being incurred by the end of 2023. This estimate increased by approximately $1 billion from last quarter due to the additional rework requirements and lower production rates continuing longer than previously expected. We recorded $285 million of these abnormal costs in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, we recorded a $3.5 billion noncash charge in the quarter to write down unamortized deferred production costs, primarily due to estimated customer compensation for the longer delivery delays. It is important to keep in mind that from an economic standpoint, cash margins on the 787 remain positive. While the additional costs and customer considerations will put some downward pressure on cash margins in the near term, cash margins are expected to remain positive and significantly improve over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain very confident in the future success of the 787, and it remains one of our most compelling programs. Importantly, none of the issues we\u2019re addressing have raised immediate safety of flight concerns or impacted the capabilities of the in-service fleet. We received gross orders for 21 airplanes last year, and we see a long runway ahead. We are working diligently to ensure that we are well positioned as demand recovers and accelerates in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to the 737 MAX program. The MAX is now approved to fly in over 185 countries. As mentioned, we continue to prepare airplanes for deliveries as early as the first quarter, subject to customer and regulatory approvals in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also delivered 245 737 MAX airplanes last year, and we\u2019ve steadily ramped up production. And we are now producing at 27 airplanes per month on our way to 31 per month early this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you look to ramp both our production rate and delivery gains this year, we will continue to monitor the impact of Omicron on resource availability. We currently have 335 737 MAX airplanes in inventory and still anticipate delivering most of these airplanes by the end of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Timing and pace of deliveries to Chinese customers are also critical assumptions to our delivery outlook. 737 abnormal costs and the liability for 737 MAX customer considerations are largely behind us. We expect the majority of the remaining $2.9 billion liability to be liquidated this year with less than 10% of the total estimate left to be negotiated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 777X, we continue to progress through our rigorous and comprehensive test program. We have flown over 1,800 flight hours through the end of 2021. We also completed engine and airplane performance testing, and the airplane continues to perform in line with our customer commitments. Our customers recognize the compelling economics and sustainability benefits this airplane offers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain engaged with the FAA and other global regulators throughout this process. We\u2019re working towards reaching Type Inspection Authorization or TIA, which is a pacing item for us to begin FAA certification flight testing. We are still anticipating delivery of the first airplane in late 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also, we are currently offering the freighter version of our 777X airplane to customers. And we\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress on sales campaigns and conclude our launch timing evaluation. As a result of increasing freighter demand, we plan to increase the combined 777, 777X production rate from two to three per month this year and expect 2022 deliveries to be relatively in line with last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space &amp; Security on slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was $5.9 billion, down 14%, and operating margin was negative 4.4%. These results were primarily driven by lower volume and less favorable performance across the portfolio, including a $402 million pretax charge on the KC-46 Tanker program. The charge is primarily driven by evolving customer requirements for a remote vision system as well as factory and supply chain disruptions, including the impact of COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the commercial crew program, as previously shared, we and NASA anticipate the second uncrewed orbital flight test to occur in May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We received $7 billion in orders during the quarter, including an award for modernization of Airborne Warning and Control System to Royal Saudi Air Force. The BDS backlog increased to $60 billion. During the quarter, BDS also delivered on critical customer milestones. Overall, we remain optimistic about our defense business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s turn to Global Services results on slide 8. Fourth quarter Global Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 15%, and operating margin was 9.3%. Results were driven by higher commercial services volume and favorable mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earnings were impacted by a $220 million inventory impairment in the fourth quarter. We received $6 billion in orders during the quarter, taking the BGS backlog to $20 billion. We also delivered the 50th 767-300 converted freighter and announced plans to add 10 new converted freighter lines. Our services business has shown great resilience in part due to the balance of both defense and commercial offerings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s move to slide 9 and cover the full year financials. Full year revenue of $62.3 billion improved 7% versus prior year. The core operating loss was negative $4.1 billion, an improvement of $10.1 billion. The resulting core loss per share was $9.44, primarily driven by the charge on the 787.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow was negative $3.4 billion, an improvement of $15 billion. The in-year cash usage was driven by 787 inventory build, 737 customer considerations and interest payments, partially offset by commercial deliveries, order activity, favorable timing of cash receipts at BDS and tax refunds related to the CARES Act.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 to cover cash and debt. We ended the fourth quarter with strong liquidity, comprised of $16.2 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet and access to $14.7 billion across our bank credit facilities, which remain undrawn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our debt balance decreased by $4.3 billion from the end of the third quarter to $58.1 billion driven by the early pay down of the delayed draw term loan. We remain committed to reducing debt levels, and our investment-grade credit rating is a priority.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please turn to the next slide for a look at 2022 and key drivers of the business. As you look ahead, 2022 performance will be driven by the commercial market recovery, return to delivery for the 787 and 737 MAX in China, production system and delivery stability and U.S.-China trade relations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our efforts to stabilize our production system, including the supply chain and improve our delivery predictability remain top priorities. These activities will be paramount to our success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking broadly across our enterprise, we\u2019re maintaining, in some cases, expanding key investments in our people, technology, manufacturing capabilities and strategic partnerships. We\u2019re advancing our development of the MAX 7, MAX 10 and 777X programs, all while continuing to invest in digital capabilities to support our next commercial airplane program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In BDS, we\u2019re progressing on the MQ-25, T-7A, Commercial Crew and several other key development programs. As we invest, we continue to be laser-focused on our business transformation efforts to drive quality, productivity and cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s take a look at the key drivers of 2022 revenue and cash. We anticipate revenue increase primarily driven by higher commercial airplane deliveries on the 737 and 787 programs. That said, revenue will be impacted by 787 customer considerations and delivering 737 airplanes that were previously remarketed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are forecasting stable revenue in our defense business and solid growth in our services business as the commercial market continues to improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to cash. We still expect to generate positive free cash flow in the year. The key driver remains higher 737 and 787 delivery volume. Keep in mind the working capital benefit from delivering airplanes from inventory will be partially offset by a lower advances in progress payments balance. We still anticipate a significant burn down of our advances balance this year, which we expect to be more front-end loaded in line with customer discussions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, cash flow will remain impacted by timing of receipts and expenditures. As you may recall, we booked orders last year that filled near-term skyline positions, and those unique receipts may not continue at the same levels this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a phasing standpoint, we anticipate the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year for deliveries, revenue, earnings and cash flow. First quarter cash flow could look similar to the usage we saw in 1Q \u201821, driven by unfavorable receipt timing, excess advance payment burn down, resource availability due to the Omicron variant and normal seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain confident that our free cash flow will improve in the second quarter and will meaningfully accelerate in the back half of the year as we achieve the key delivery milestones that I previously outlined.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look to the future, we expect 2023 cash flow will be materially higher than 2022. We look forward to sharing more details on our plan as soon as we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, the business environment remains dynamic, but we\u2019ve made important progress. We are confident that we\u2019re on the right path, we\u2019re taking the right steps to drive stability and making the right investments to ensure the business is well positioned for future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, closing comments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dave Calhoun</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. No further comments. I\u2019d like to turn it over to questions and give all our time to that. Thanks.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So maybe can you help us understand the $3.5 billion of charges tied to the 787 in addition to the abnormal cost of $2 billion through 2023? That\u2019s up $1 billion from Q3 as you mentioned, Brian. What does this imply for the future profit and cash tied to the 787 program? How do we think about those deliveries going back up to 5 and then timing of those deliveries restarting because some of your customers have talked about an April time frame?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Sheila. So, on the 787 $3.5 billion, we previously described a pretty labor-intensive rework solution on the door surrounds. And in the quarter, we determined that this rework was going to be needed to be formed on all of the airplanes inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the abnormal is $1 billion higher and will mostly go through 2023 because of this higher rework cost and the production rates being lower for longer. This, in turn, has our delivery slide to the right. So, more airplanes will be impacted, not just the ones in inventory. And we provided for estimated customer concessions because of these delays, which drove the $3.5 billion charge. While this hurts in the near term, we still believe it\u2019s the right thing to do because long term, we\u2019re going to sell a lot of these 787s for decades. So, we just got to work our way through this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of getting back to 5, so we got to first get cleared to deliver, and then we\u2019re going to gradually work our way to a point we\u2019re going to get back up to 5. We don\u2019t have the time frame, but we think that the first step is getting the first one out the door.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the April time frame, Dave, maybe you could comment on the customer implications on that one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the April time frame is all I\u2019ll say is the customers know everything that we do. We share the same regulator. They are in our factories looking at the airplanes every day. So, they know exactly what\u2019s going on and where it is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t want to get ahead of anybody with respect to speculating the day we pick it. That\u2019s up to the FAA, and we\u2019re going to let them do what they have to do. Otherwise, I think Brian described this charge exactly the way it is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks so much. So, maybe to follow up on Sheila\u2019s question. Of the $3.5 billion, you mentioned that\u2019s noncash, how much of it turns into cash? How much of it is the abnormal -- the $1 billion increase? And how much of it is customer considerations? And when do you expect those to be paid out?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Sure, Cai. So, the $1 billion increase on the abnormal is separate from the $3.5 billion. And in terms of the $3.5 billion, that will play out over a longer period of time, particularly as we have discussions with customers. Some of that might be accelerated in the near term, but overall, it\u2019s going to take us time for that cash flow to go out. It will take years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of how much is customer concessions, we\u2019re not going to talk about all of the pieces. Trust that as we closed the quarter, we took all the estimates in terms of what we think was going to happen both for contractual and non-contractual concessions. And it\u2019s embedded into our closing position. And we feel good about that, and now we just have to work through with our customers to -- and then start delivering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the abnormal, again, that cash flow will likely go out over the next two years as most of that will be behind us as we get out of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The only other context is that unlike in the case of the MAX, we do have an experience, unfortunately, that we can draw from in setting these estimates, and most importantly, the management of the concessions with our customers over time. So, what we\u2019ve posted and the way we think about it is largely based on that historical experience, of course, with the MAX. So, I feel like we\u2019ve probably bounded it pretty reasonably.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 37 MAX given the lead times in the supply chain, I know that you\u2019re evaluating the timing of further increases, but can you get much above 31 a month before the end of the year if you haven\u2019t made that decision yet? And obviously, suppliers are thinking that you\u2019re looking to the 40 level as you leave \u201822, maybe a little clarification there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll leave the supplier and the increase to Dave. I want to take the near-term production delivery MAX question head-on because it\u2019s largely unchanged from where we were last quarter as what we expect to happen in 2022. We\u2019ve got 335 units of inventory. And that will liquidate through the year at a quarterly rate that is pretty similar to what we did last quarter. And then, the production ramp, as you know, Myles, is going to go from 26 to 31 fairly soon. So, we all think that\u2019s going to play out. And again, it\u2019s similar to what we had thought last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The one watch item that we have in the first quarter is any disruption on Omicron that might have a bit of a slower start, but we\u2019ll work our way through that. The total profile is largely unchanged. And we\u2019re quite confident in the demand. And maybe in terms of further rate increase supply chain, I\u2019ll let Dave comment on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, just the prognosis that we can move it up and based on what everybody seems to want to believe. We are going to be very aggressive with our supply chain to get buffers at every corner so that we can do it. And then the question is, do we do it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, right now, we have fewer supply constraints probably than the industry simply because we\u2019ve got this big finished goods inventory that\u2019s going to carry us for the better part of the calendar year and then even a little bit into next year. So, we\u2019ll take advantage of that, and then we\u2019ll ask the supply chain to build buffer, both on our premise and in theirs to protect upside. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you talk about that next release, the next uptick this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can I talk about the next...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, going to 31?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Above 31. You announced that -- is that a 1Q decision basically? I know the Company is evaluating further increasing\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. No, no. I would say no, it\u2019s not a 1Q decision for us. As I said, we will work our supply chain and work with our supply chain transparently to protect upside on rate as we get to the second half of the year, et cetera. And the minute we are ready to do it, we\u2019ll do it. But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself on that front. Certainly not now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just going back to 787 timing, so I just want to make sure I have this correct. So, American Airlines is up to speed. It\u2019s an estimate, but their estimate isn\u2019t missing an update from you that they said last week that there\u2019s been nothing new for them in the last few months. So, today\u2019s updates from you are marking to market additional rework, future concessions as you\u2019ve determined them over the last few months as opposed to an additional timing delay for the restart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I agree with what you just said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then, Dave, can you maybe just get a little more specific in what is left to do? It sounds like you were kind of iterating back and forth on inspection and rework, but that you\u2019ve agreed to that. So, what\u2019s actually left to do to resume deliveries?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, -- so we\u2019ll have to complete the rework on a large fleet of airplanes. So, that in and of itself is -- takes some time to do. But then we have to update every analytic that we provide to our regulator based on every next rework. So, to just again, corroborate the case that we have with respect to conformance. So, you have a lag in that. You collect that data. You include it in the analytic. And then when it gets to be sufficient, you will provide it to the FAA, and then there\u2019s a work -- you work through it with them. But that is the sort of the process that we have to go through. And there\u2019s no way to shortcut it. And I can\u2019t collect data on the airplanes I haven\u2019t reworked yet. I have to get through it. I\u2019ve got to simply work my way through that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have confidence in the rework programs. We have no new discoveries with respect to how we do the rework, and they\u2019re getting perfected just like in the case of standard work in building an airplane the first time, we have to do sort of the same thing with rework processes. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So, I wish it could go faster, and I can\u2019t accelerate it. I need them all to take their time and go through their learning curves and post the data to the analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Why can\u2019t you deliver a new one clean off the line that doesn\u2019t have any of the historical errors as opposed to waiting to rework what\u2019s already built?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, there\u2019s a -- again, I\u2019m not going to speak for my regulator because that\u2019s up to them on how we do it and maybe that\u2019s how things end up working. On the other hand, they are going to ticket that airplane, and they\u2019re going to want to know everything there is to know about everything. And we\u2019re still posting data with respect to what we find in our fleet. So, I don\u2019t know what more to say. I wish it was perfectly predictable. It\u2019s just not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Strauss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dave, in terms of MAX deliveries, can you give us kind of an estimate of what we should think about for actual deliveries in 2022, given the rate and given the inventory liquidation you\u2019re talking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Brian, a follow-up on free cash flow just given what you\u2019re implying for the Q1 burn at like $4 billion to $5 billion seems like a long pause to get to free cash flow positive for the full year. I mean, are we talking about closer to low-single-digit billions and mid-single-digit billions in terms of positive free cash flow? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, in terms of the free cash flow, it\u2019s really going to be driven by three specific things. There is seasonality like every first quarter. There\u2019s going to be BDS stability that doesn\u2019t repeat, and there\u2019s going to be some assumption on excess burn down. But I think that we have a handle around all that, and we do think it is in and out of the first quarter, and the second quarter does get favorable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be quite as high as the number you are throwing around, but it is going to be in the small billions. In terms of the -- your question on MAX deliveries. So, I go back to where we were last quarter, and we kind of had a ballpark of what that would look like. That hasn\u2019t changed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, if we continue to liquidate the inventory at about the rate that we did last quarter, and you then have your production ramp go from 26 to 31, that kind of gets us to a spot where we have a pretty good profile of what that\u2019s going to look like through the year with the one caveat is that the first quarter is probably going to be a little slow, one, because it usually is; and two, because we, like others, are wrestling with this Omicron.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Strauss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Somewhere around 500 deliveries, is that what we\u2019re looking at?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ballpark seems pretty good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Seifman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess, it seems a little bit of a shame to ask the question about the next aircraft because there\u2019s -- I know there\u2019s a lot of more imminent stuff for the Company, but you did discuss it, Dave. And so, when you think about that, just maybe your updated thoughts because you did mention the work that you\u2019re doing there. And I also asked the question in light of the success that Airbus had this past quarter with some of -- with some 737 customers. Any evolution in your thinking, number one, about market share; and number two, about the -- about where the value comes from in the aircraft? Because I think you\u2019ve said in the past that it\u2019s going to come from Boeing and not the propulsion system. And that suggests a pretty big investment for Boeing. And so, maybe Brian can also chime in on thinking about how the balance sheet plays into that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Seth, I appreciate the question. We are -- as you know, have a reasonably full pipeline with respect to airplane developments with the MAX derivatives and the 777X, which I, again, I will highlight as a true differentiator in the marketplace as it displaces not just the 47, but also 380 over time. Anyway, so I feel good about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if we\u2019re fortunate and we get customers interested in a freighter version of it, we will move aggressively along those lines. So, we have a pretty good product family and development pipeline ahead of us. I just don\u2019t think that should be lost on anyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly, the much longer term and much bigger program for me is the one we refer to as our IPT, integrated product team, where we\u2019re going to revamp the development process itself. And anyone who\u2019s been around our industry for a long period of time knows that the big variables in our financial performance over time usually relate to shortfalls in the development process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And my intent and my hope in light of all the new tools that are available to us, both in terms of digital modeling on the original design, but then also being able to use that same modeling to perfect manufacturing processes at scale and ultimately, serviceability, that is where the action is. That is where the next airplane is going to differentiate itself more than any other, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we are invested and continue to stay invested. We\u2019ve allocated much of our top talent across the Company to that effort. I can\u2019t wait to update everybody on, again, that progress. It won\u2019t be as exciting because it doesn\u2019t fly away, but it is, in my opinion, the most important thing that we can do, and we remain totally focused on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to the competitiveness of our product portfolio, I still feel very good about it. I never will look at any last deal and suggest that we\u2019re losing to this -- losing to somebody or not. You have to take the totality of the last couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They have airplanes that absolutely outperform us in certain applications, and we have some that outperform them in applications. And our customers are really good discerning the differences and making their choices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I apologize, I\u2019m sure I sound like a broken record, but we think we have our priorities right here. There will be a next airplane. As I did say and I will acknowledge, I don\u2019t think the propulsion system is going to add as much value to that next airplane, either ours or theirs, as it has historically, which means that the airframer has to add more value to it in order to make it a compelling sale to our customers. I look forward to that moment anyway. So, we\u2019re doing our very best to get ready for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on the balance sheet side of it, for us, over time, one priority is to take leverage down, but also a priority is to make sure we\u2019re going to be ready to invest in that next airplane at the right moment. And we do various scenario plannings, and we think we\u2019ve got options and things to make all that happen. But again, that\u2019s a little bit of a longer look, but nothing would suggest we wouldn\u2019t want to be investors for the right airplane.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just maybe following up on that previous question. When you look at the market share dynamic in the narrowbody market, and the charges that have been taken on 78 and 73 and T-7 and tanker and MQ-25, why was this the right time to put $0.5 billion into Wisk?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ron, I appreciate the question. This is definitely the right time to put $0.5 billion into Wisk. Number one, it\u2019s a very innovative product and a very innovative product team. I didn\u2019t create it. Our partners did at Kitty Hawk. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the work they\u2019re doing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The world wants autonomy and the world wants electric. And this is going to be our application of those two technologies and to put it into real service by way of certification. So, everything about this program we like, technically innovative, and it will serve a niche we don\u2019t serve today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s really not necessarily why you do it if you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a long-term avenue for both autonomy and electric and a lot to learn in the process. So, again, I view this as a high priority. It does not compete for the discussion we just had with respect to the next large commercial airplane by way of financial resources.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll have plenty of financial resources and wherewithal to be able to do both and then some. But I am enthusiastic about our Wisk investment in the airplane and the experience to date. It\u2019s incredibly innovative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Ron, one thing to note. So, we\u2019ve made this commitment to the investors, but that cash is going to happen over time. And it\u2019s capped in any given quarter. So, we\u2019re not really going to see it disrupt anything in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Got it. And Dave, do you see the autonomous technology that\u2019s being developed there potentially with an application on one of your larger products?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s a lot to be learned and applied, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dave, you\u2019ve talked a lot about China and how important it is from the demand side. But, if you look at the other side of this, you\u2019ve got a lot of content in China, like the Tianjin Composite Center structures from SAMC. Given the heavy border restrictions and lockdowns there, aside from the political things that keep getting talked about, how are you managing that part of your supply chain and any potential risks there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t -- our team doesn\u2019t see any near-term or even medium-term risks there. And performance has been outstanding. I\u2019m never going to say never that big disruptions can occur. I don\u2019t -- if those kinds of disruptions occur, we got a lot of other issues we\u2019re going to have to contend with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So honestly, it\u2019s not the highest thing on our list. It performs quite well. We do have options. Admittedly, they take time to put into gear. But no, I think we\u2019re in an okay place there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you highlight then where you do see the most -- the biggest constraints as you try and ramp up from a supply chain point of view?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, it\u2019s going to go back to the old engine questions and castings and forgings. That has already constrained our outlook. And I think as I mentioned the last time we were all together, I wish we could have done increase rates even faster than we had acknowledged, but it has always been a supply constraint that has done that. And it\u2019s mostly forgings and castings and mostly through our engine suppliers. So, that is what it is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I do think they are under control and being managed very effectively and that the supply side of this is that everybody has put their cushions in place to be able to take care of it. And then the only other medium term, I haven\u2019t been asked, maybe I will, I won\u2019t call it short term, but medium-term question, of course, is titanium. And as long as the geopolitical situation stays tame, no problem. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019re protected for quite a while, but not forever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dave, I wanted to go with a high-level question here now that you\u2019ve been in the seat for a while, recognizing that you\u2019ve spent most of this time putting out fires. But when we discuss the Boeing investment thesis after a decade of fairly extreme swings in performance, we\u2019re often asked, particularly by investors that are returning to the story after an absence, how the culture is changing at Boeing. So, how should investors think of you and your team as agents of change? And in what ways are you improving the culture of Boeing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, that\u2019s the million-dollar question, and I appreciate you asking it. And that\u2019s what we work on every day all day. I think investors, those same investors, what frustrates them is the unpredictability of our performance in light of those few instances that caused severe pressure on our company. And I will be the first to admit that they were not events caused by the outside world, but unfortunately, missteps inside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we\u2019re doing, I think, what they would want us to do. Our culture is focused on getting as close to our work as we possibly can from the very top of the Company through the engineering ranks all the way down through all the support functions that ultimately have to help mechanics on the line stay disciplined, create standard work that\u2019s predictable, repeatable, et cetera, safety and quality systems that are reinculcated in every way I can think of into every nook and cranny of the Company. And that is literally what we have been working on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I appreciate the question. I think we\u2019re getting much better. In fact, we\u2019re getting really good at it. And I think someday, we\u2019ll all point to it as a real advantage for The Boeing Company. But I know where we\u2019re coming from. And you do, too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, I do appreciate the Company. Sometimes, our vision and our priorities look boring to people. But when you stop and think of where we came from, I\u2019m proud of this team for rallying around exactly that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Dave, maybe just to put a finer point on China MAX kind of deliveries resuming. You sound pretty confident that this could be a first quarter event. So, what do we specifically need to see from the Chinese regulator? It sounds like they\u2019re doing some test flights over there already. What should we be looking for? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you. Yes. It\u2019s again, I don\u2019t think this is necessarily in the geopolitical realm as much as it is in the needs of the customers and operations inside of China. What I will say is it has been perfectly predictable and methodical way in which they\u2019ve returned their fleet to service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They went through the cert process. They reauthorized the airplane to fly. The airlines are warming up the airplanes they already have. As you said, they\u2019re taking test flights in a very methodical, intelligent way. And they are beginning to notify us around when they intend to bring it into revenue service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That all has to happen with the airplanes they own. And then deliveries, in my view, will commence. And it is quiet, methodical and as effective way as it has been to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re involved in that would suggest otherwise. So anyway, I do feel confident only because of every tea leave I\u2019ve been able to watch here. And they\u2019re following through on, frankly, every commitment they\u2019ve made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kristine Liwag</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brian, thank you for providing the puts and takes and free cash flow for 2022. But could you quantify some of these pieces for the year and the key variables they depend on? I mean, ultimately, the questions I\u2019m getting is, is 2022 free cash flow a smidge over zero, or is it closer to something like $5 billion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It\u2019s not a smidge over zero. I promise you that. And we\u2019re not going to be as descriptive as you might want. However, as we begin to deliver on these milestones and we start to be able to have the volume improvement from the 737, 787, we know we are going to have accelerated cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned, first quarter, we know it\u2019s going to be usage, but we do expect that there will be a relatively sharp acceleration in the back half of the year as we begin to liquidate this inventory. And then as we exit the year, we\u2019re going to be moving to a much more normalized state and then have a meaningful acceleration of cash flow in 2023. And again, what number of billions, too close to call, but it\u2019s more than zero, I promise you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt Welch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for one last call or one last question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly. And that will be from Ken Herbert with RBC. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Herbert</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to see if we could put a finer point on the 787 and where you are with production today and the inventory drawdown. It looks like you\u2019re producing at a lower rate, perhaps one or lower a month than the two you were coming out of the third quarter. And obviously, the uptick to five sounds maybe a little more cautious than before. Can you just comment on build rates on the 87? And then, what the free cash guide implies in terms of the inventory reduction this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me just start with the rate. There\u2019s not going to be a finer point other than to reemphasize our priorities, which is we don\u2019t like carrying a bunch of inventory. That\u2019s for sure. We will run our rate as low as we can while we burn our inventory as fast as we can I think is the way to think about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, as the order books fill up and the market gets very active, and I happen to believe it will, then we\u2019re going to sort of monitor production rates to make sure we stay ahead of that delivery cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, again, I can\u2019t give you a finer point on exactly when and how. I will suggest we have a clear priority, which is to burn down that inventory first. Brian, anything you want to\u2026?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And there is an assumption that we\u2019re going to have some liquidation of inventory for sure on the 787. Stay tuned for the specifics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that completes The Boeing Company\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dave Calhoun</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.
