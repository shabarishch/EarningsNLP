In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with some comments on the quarter and our business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through details of our financial results and outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s move to slide two please. Boeing delivered another strong quarter with solid operating performance across our production programs and services businesses which drove a 19% increase in our core earnings per share. This performance has allowed us to continue returning cash to our shareholders through our strong dividend and share repurchase program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenue at Boeing Commercial Airplanes increased 15% to $16 billion and operating margins were strong at 11.2%. We delivered 186 commercial airplanes in the third quarter, including 31 787 Dreamliners and we added net new orders of 501 airplanes. Boeing defense, space and security revenue was $8 billion in the third quarter and operating margins increased to 10.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">BDS captured numerous key contract awards in the quarter, including NASA\u2019s commercial crew spaceship program with a potential value of $4.2 billion. And the first order for the 02 Phoenix small satellite.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Significant BDS program milestones include delivery of the first Chinook helicopter under the latest multi-year contract with the U.S. Army, successful launch in orbit of the seventh GPS IIF satellite, and delivery of the first four upgraded Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft for France.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let\u2019s turn to the business environment on slide three. Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net new orders for the year of 1011 are well above our planned output and our record backlog of more than 5500 aircraft represents more than seven years of production at current rates. Given the 737\u2019s robust backlog of more than 4000 orders, we plan to increase production from the current rate of 42 per month to 47 in 2017 and then increase production again to 52 per month in 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Furthermore, the compelling value proposition of the 787 and its sizeable backlog of more than 850 orders are driving production rate increases from today\u2019s per month to the previously announced rate of 12 per month in 2016 and then up to 14 by the end of the decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also are increasing production on the 767 from the current rate of 1 per month to two per month in 2016. Notwithstanding a somewhat richer mix of global economic and geopolitical developments throughout this year which we are monitoring very carefully, global passenger traffic trends are strong, and air cargo traffic continues to gradually improve, although the latter still remains a watch item for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see replacement demand as an increasingly important market driver with airlines opting to introduce newer more efficient airplanes with compelling economics and a rapid return on investment rather than keeping older less efficient models in service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our new technologically advanced airplanes not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increase residual values, greater range and a better overall passenger experience. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft. When we look at that combination of growth and replacement needs over the next 20 years, we forecast global demand for nearly 37,000 new commercial airplanes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Near term, the customers continue to demonstrate confidence in their fleet plans with deferral requests still running well below the historical average and we continue to have requests to accelerate deliveries. This ongoing strong demand, coupled with our large and diverse backlog underpins our outlook for sustained growth in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the Twin-Aisle segment, we continue to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the new 777X which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to transition between the two airplanes. We also continue to enhance the value proposition of the 777 for customers with our relentless drive of product improvements that will further increase operating efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year to date, we have 45 orders and commitments for the 777. We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade with an anticipated average order capture around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll continue to evaluate our options for the most efficient way to transition from the current 777 to the 777X as the new airplane enters final assembly in the 2018 timeframe. We are also introducing new manufacturing processes and technologies that allow us to further optimize the 777X production system. As we mentioned before, a smooth production transition is a top priority on this program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 787 program, we achieved several noteworthy milestones, including delivering the fifth 787-9 as well as the first 787-9 with GE powered engines. Both the GE and Rolls-Royce engine types are now certified on the 787-9. In addition, our Charleston facility delivered its first 787 at its planned production rate of approximately three per month which supports the overall current production rate of 10 per month. Production performance at Charleston continues to progress nicely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the Single-Aisle segment, demand for our new fuel efficient 737 MAX remains high with cumulative orders totaling nearly 2300 airplanes from 47 customers. The production bridge from today\u2019s 737 to the MAX remains solid with the first MAX delivery expected in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to defense, space and security, we continue to solid support for our major programs in the FY15 budget process. We are encouraged by the actions taken in the both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees with regard to additional Apaches and EA-18G Growlers as well as strong support from both on P-8 and Tanker. Our international business represented 28% of BDS revenues during the quarter and 37% of the BDS backlog as we continue to leverage our unique One Boeing global advantage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance and the critical few large scale future programs that are priorities for our customers, like Long Range Strike, space launch system, UCLASS and the T-X trainer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The relative strength of our defense, space and security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable proven and affordable. We continue to focus on driving further efficiency, quality and productivity gains to improve program profitability and fund investment in future growth. As part of these efforts, BDS continues to make strong progress on our market based affordability initiative as we strive to reduce operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our announcement in December of plans to consolidate some of our defense service and support work into Oklahoma City and St. Louis is one example of those efforts. Decisions that affect our workforce are never easy, but we are fortunate to have a growing commercial business with employment needs that have helped mitigate some of the impact on our people. In summary, our team is executing on our business strategy by meaningfully growing revenues, generating, solid operating performance on improved execution and capturing strategic new business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Jim and good morning. Let\u2019s turn to slide four to discuss our third quarter results. Third quarter revenue increased 7% to $23.8 billion driven by growth in our commercial airplane business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Core operating margins increased to 10.2%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses. Third quarter core earnings per share increased 19%, $2.14 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Let\u2019s turn now to our commercial airplane business on slide five.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The third quarter our commercial airplane business increased revenue 15% to a record $16.1 billion on a 186 airplane deliveries. The solid BCA operating margin of an 11.2 % reflects strong program execution offset by the impact of higher 787 and 747 deliveries and higher fleet support for new customer introductions. Commercial airplane captured $69 billion of net orders during the quarter and backlog achieved a new record of $430 billion and over 5500 aircraft in seven years of production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the third quarter, 787 deferred production cost increased $947 million to $25.2 billion, largely driven by the increase of 787-9 production and the continued inventory pull ahead to efficiently optimize in production and minimize disruption as we introduce the aircraft into our production system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similarly, on the 787-10, we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to accelerate our build plan in early 2015 to mitigate early introduction risk, while preparing to increase the overall 787 production rate to 12 per month in 2016. The team continues to reduce unit cost and improve float time on both the 787-8 and 787-9 through continued focus on optimization of the production and maximizing efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we continue to make solid progress on the 787 program, however, we still have work ahead of us as I said introducing the 787-9 in production preparing for the 12 per month rate and again, introduction the 787-10 while drive efficiencies across all aspects of the program. The team remains focused on solid day-to-day execution, risk mitigation and improving the long-term productivity and profitability and cash flow going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to defense, space and security results on slide six, third quarter revenue for our defense business was $7.9 billion and operating margins increased to 10.8% due to strong performance across the business. Boeing Military Aircraft third quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.5 billion, reflecting higher volume on our P-8 program. BMA operating margins also increased to 12.4% on continued solid program execution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Global services and support revenue of $2.3 billion and operating margins were 9.7% largely due to deliver mix in the quarter. Network and space systems reported revenue of $2 billion, reflecting timing of ULA launches and lower government satellite volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating margins increased to 9.3% in the quarter on strong program execution across the portfolio. Defense, space and security reported a solid backlog of $60 billion with 37% of our current backlog now from international customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to slide seven, Boeing Capital\u2019s net financing portfolio increased slightly to $3.5 billion on some new aircraft volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, turning to cash flow on slide eight. Third quarter operating cash flow before pension contributions was $1.7 billion driven by higher commercial airplane production rates and solid operating performance somewhat offset by timing, receipts and expenditures in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we made a plan to discretionary pension contribution of $750 million. With regard to capital deployment, we paid $525 million in dividends to shareholders and repurchased 8 million shares for a $1 billion in the third quarter, bringing our year to date repurchase activity to 39 million shares or $5 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performance going forward. We expect to complete the remaining $5.8 billion repurchase authorization over approximately next one to two years. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains a priority for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s move now to cash and debt balances on slide nine. We ended the quarter with $10 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our cash balance continues to provide sound liquidity and positions us well going forward. Turning now to slide 10, we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are increasing our core earnings per share guidance for 2014 by $0.20 to now be $8.10 to $8.30 on continued solid execution. Based on strong operating performance, combined with the impact of timing of receipts and expenditures, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance before pension contributions for 2015 to now be greater than $7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, as a result of our continued focus on execution and disciplined cash management, we are lowering our outlook for capital spending by $200 million to now be approximately $2.3 billion for the year. This performance allowed us to further return cash to shareholders as we continue to aggressively repurchase shares and pay dividends. Remain confident in our long term cash generation potential given the focus on execution, our ability to deliver on the unprecedented backlog and our unmatched portfolio of products and services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are also increasing our BCA operating margin guidance to be approximately 10.5% on improved operating performance. In the fourth quarter, we expect BCA margins to be impacted by higher deliveries of 747 and 767, some additional planned fleet support costs for new customer introductions, higher R&amp;D on the 787-10 and 777X, as well as additional investments in productivity initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, third quarter financial performance reflects the strength of our backlog, the strong demand for our products and services and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the enterprise. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim for some closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Greg. With three solid quarters behind us, we are focused on closing out the year with continued strong business performance that will allow us to meet our customer commitments and our investments in the future, recognize and reward our team for their work and continue to return cash to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our priorities in 2014 and beyond remain clear, profitably ramp-up in production on our commercial airplane programs, executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity and affordability throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and position our defense business with targeted investments and further international expansion and all the while providing increasing value to both our customers and our shareholders. Now, Greg and I would be happy to take your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">(Operator Instructions) Our first question will be from Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you look at the year so far and you\u2019ve had very strong margins in BCA, in this quarter, your unit margin turned significantly positive which is new.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But on the other side, deferred production on the 787 moved slightly above your guidance level and I would say free cash flow for the quarter was low given your guidance even before pension. So I\u2019d like to understand better how you see the operating performance, the strong operating performance we\u2019ve seen turn into cash going forward? And specifically, when do you see the 787-8 and the 787-9 each turning cash positive? And what else drove the high unit margins in the quarter, is that something that we should expect to continue?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Well, Doug, let me start with cash flow. Certainly, you are right, I mean strong execution across the business and across the programs and that\u2019s certainly driving our cash flow to date. And as I mentioned before, there\u2019s timing quarter between quarter when you \u2013 relates to advances and milestone payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that \u2013 some of that is what you are seeing \u2013 equate that to timing is what you are seeing on the quarter. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve been pulling forward 787 inventory and particularly around 787-9 to ensure that that program enters into the production system in a very smooth manner of which it is doing. We also got some timing C-17 orders that we\u2019ve talked about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So those, again, are related to timing throughout the balance of the year. So we still expect to see very strong cash flow through the balance of the year and really coming from the elements we talked about, continuing to execute on the deliveries, on the productivity as well as the 787 unit cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, when you look forward into 2015, we expect to see continued growth in cash flow, again, through the execution on the production rate, additional productivity, international orders and that will be somewhat offset by our cash taxes and 777X R&amp;D starting to kind of come into play, [but that could] (ph) you\u2019ll see growth. And then, from there forward, as we talked about, you\u2019ll continue to see operating cash flow growth throughout the balance, and again, that\u2019s all executing on our production rates and continuing to drive productivity. I am not sure if I covered all your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, if you look at the \u2013 you are talking about moving inventory forward related to the 787-9 and I am trying to understand if you \u2013 if it\u2019s possible to put that aside for a moment and think about how the 787-8 and 787-9 are each performing in terms of costs, are those \u2013 is the 787-8 cash positive yet if were to look at it on a standalone basis? Can you give us a sense of where that is today relative to, I would call, more one-time items related to inventory timing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, yes, no \u2013 as I said before, we are not cash positive yet. We expect to be cash positive in the 2015 timeframe and that will be a blend obviously of 787-8 and 787-9, but if you step back and look at unit cost on 787-8 and 787-9, they continue to progress well as I\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, as well as I would say the other key indicators that ultimately make into deferred and cash around flow time and overall cost of quality, all of those trending in the right direction on the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So obviously we expect that to continue, continue to expect to come down the learning curve on the 787 as well as step down into [prior] (ph) pricing and continuing to work the productivity initiatives, all of that ultimately contributing to cash flow over the long term of the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Harned \u2013 Sanford Bernstein</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, just staying on the deferred, so wondering if you could \u2013 if you have a new estimate of where it might take or if we are sticking with [about 25 even though] (ph) we are already a little bit over?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just honing into the 787-9, I think the pull forward, you\u2019ve talked about the inventory is a little more than maybe you expected a year ago, could you maybe give a little more concrete \u2013 give us a little more on exactly what\u2019s going on there, is this payments to suppliers that are happening in advance? I guess, quantify it a little bit and help us get a sense as to when maybe flips the other way?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, maybe just to kind of help when you look at just over $900 million of growth in deferred in the quarter, there\u2019s about a couple of hundred million dollars in there that\u2019s related to 787-9 pull forward. So, essentially, what they are doing is, as these products become more mature in the production system and the suppliers are performing, we are pulling those components and migrating those into the production system to allow a smooth transition as we are operating it at 10 a month and Ray and the team have a done a fantastic job in doing that and you are seeing that in the results, we are making our \u2013 obviously our deliveries. And so that kind of methodology they are utilizing in the production system is a risk reduction, certainly, impacts deferred on the near term, but as far as the long-term profitability and risk reduction on the program, absolutely the right thing to do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as I\u2019ve said to you in the past, the program team out there is focused on unit by unit improvement on all aspects, whether it is quality, unit cost or flow time and ultimately, cash and that\u2019s certainly what they are managing, but there\u2019s some near term, as I said, risk mitigating activities that we\u2019ve taken into account here that do impact near term on deferred, but are absolutely the right thing to do for this program and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen in the quarter and you are going to continue to see some of that as we start to pull forward 787-10 products and get those into the production system, derisk the overall production system and get ready for 12 a month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the overall deferred, there\u2019s really no change, I said it would be approximately $25 billion, we are at $25.2 billion, but again, keep in mind, last two or three quarters we pulled forward 787-9 and that wasn\u2019t in the original plan, there\u2019s no question about that, but again, absolutely the right thing to do. So, we are continuing to focus on it, but like I said, Joe, it\u2019s all about making rate and making unit cost improvements unit over unit and that\u2019s what the team continues to focus on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I may, this is violating the one part, one question, but just to keep on the point \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I understand the 787-9 pull forward is a couple of hundred, and I think maybe it was $300 million or so, $300 million or $400 million last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I understand that, but it doesn\u2019t seem like sequentially the other part of deferred really came down. It seems like that was maybe $700 million and change, last quarter, $700 million and change this quarter, so is there any more color on the 787-8?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, no \u2013 787-8 continues to make progress. So we are continuing to make progress there and as we have. So there\u2019s really, I would say, they are continuing on the trajectory of reducing unit cost as we\u2019ve been on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Nadol \u2013 JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from<strong> </strong>Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks so much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Cai.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not to beat a dead horse, but if we take out the pull forwards which is not execution, it doesn\u2019t look like the 787 deferreds are coming down that much. Hence, it is pretty \u2013 I am confused as to why you got a $1 billion positive swing in unit cost or about $500 million profit, which were the programs that were profitable or more profitable in the third quarter versus in the second quarter and how does that all [square] (ph) with the trend in 787 deferreds? Thanks</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I mean, on overall unit, we saw improvement on the 777 quarter over quarter and about flat on the 777. Now I\u2019d give you some perspective, on the 777, we also had a block extension, 200 units that included the investment [to go up to 52] (ph) but also most of that, those 200 units were MAX airplanes. So I think it really gives you a sense of the value this airplane is bringing to the marketplace and at the same time, the focus on productivity that you are seeing on not just that program, obviously on the other program. So good performance I would say on the core programs and continuing to make progress on the 787, but when you look at unit versus program, Cai, you also go to take into the account, as I\u2019ve talked before, mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you\u2019ve got more early build on the Charleston and more 787-9s in there in Q3 and even with that, you\u2019ve seen improvement when you compare unit to program. So continuing to make progress, still got a long way to go, but I think they got good plans in place, they are monitoring them, we\u2019ve got the enterprise engaged on how to capture more productivity and then going forward, obviously, partnering for success and supplier step-down as we introduce new blocks into the production system. So all of that adding to the improvement in unit costs going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cai Von Rumohr \u2013 Cowen and Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You are welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next go to<strong> </strong>Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning, gentlemen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick clarification on the 777, your comment about near versus program, did the 777 program margin change in the quarter? And then as a follow-on, the period expenses and fleet support that called up both in the release and in your prepared remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, can you help us understand, maybe how impactful that is to the full year margin and then maybe help us understand the cadence of those expenses, quarter over quarter, have those been growing sequentially each quarter or were they high one quarter versus the others, any help there will be much appreciated?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Our 777 margin did improve slightly in the quarter and again a lot other things I talked about on the 787 are obviously embedded into the 777. So we are continuing to try to reduce the unit cost overall on that program. So, you are seeing some of the results of that. On the period expense, I would say, the moving pieces within there are fleet support and as you know, we are introducing more new 787s to customers this year than we have in the prior years and we want to ensure that that is a very smooth transition. So we are making investments in fleet support to ensure that they do have \u2013 able to introduce those airplanes very smoothly into their operating system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then R&amp;D, so you are starting to see in the back half here, you\u2019ll see 787-10 really starting to ramp up and you all see early introduction of the 777X R&amp;D. So those are primarily the moving pieces. You also got a little bit of mix in the fourth quarter BCA margin where we will have a couple of more 747s that\u2019ll be dilutive on the margin basis. But again, we are going to continue to manage that as we have. And if we see an opportunity to improve that margin in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll certainly capture those gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Copeland \u2013 Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from<strong> </strong>John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you for taking my question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, I wanted to ask a bit about the buyback activity year to date and what the right way to interpret it? In the prepared remarks, I heard you sort of reaffirm that you\u2019ll finish the rest of the authorization over the next one to two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Godyn \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am curious when we think about the buyback year to date and the fact that it\u2019s been at an elevated rate, is that a disagreement with the market on the price of the stock, is that the expectation of continued strong execution going forward? What is driving the decision to buy back at an elevated rate?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll [say the latter] (ph), that\u2019s the</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Godyn \u2013Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.<strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean when you step back, just think about, and I\u2019ve talked about this a lot, because there is a lot of big moving pieces in here, as I\u2019ve talked before on advances or milestone, you step back and you think about last year and this year combined, over $16 billion of cash generation coming from the core operation and you look at that and then you look at the production rates, you look at the record backlog and the fact is I think we\u2019ve got maybe three or four production rate increases going forward that we need to execute, we\u2019ve already been through almost $17 billion to date. And that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us the confidence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The risk profile obviously has changed dramatically and the continued focus on execution and repurchasing $5 billion of stock this year really, again, looking forward, looking at the strength of the backlog, looking at our ability to execute on that backlog and capture additional productivity and that\u2019s what\u2019s really driven us to buy back the shares at the pace we have been buying back. And we put the authorization in place obviously to utilize it and we are going to continue to do that as we fit, but it gets back to just the fundamentals and I think the competitive differentiator in the marketplace, in the marketplace where you are looking at 5500 airplanes in backlog and we know where they are, we are very happy with the quality of that backlog, [gets to] (ph) execute on that and executing on that flawlessly and I think the team has done a great job and I think we are going to continue to do a great job going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Godyn \u2013Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And is there a potential to revisit or even increase the authorization going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we certainly will do that as we [fit] (ph)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Godyn \u2013Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next move to<strong> </strong>Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W.

I think as you think about next year, obviously, we\u2019ll see strong growth coming out of BCA going into next year, again, executing on the production rates and we\u2019re also expecting a little bit higher services revenue going into next year. Now, on the margin front, we\u2019re going to have a little bit more R&amp;D than we had this year and again, that\u2019s a ramp-down obviously of the 787-9, ramp-up of the 777X and the 787-10 and then again, improvements on 787 margin expected into next year and then we\u2019re going to continue to make investments in 777X automation as we\u2019ve talked about I think in the past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, those are kinds of moving pieces if you think about going into next year and then of course, we\u2019re continuing to focus on the productivity initiatives I discussed. That\u2019s generally I think the best way to look at it for next year and again, on the top line, we know we need to do and on the bottom line, we\u2019re going to continue doing what we\u2019ve \u2013 what we have been doing this year and last year on productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sam Pearlstein \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, just on something you said a couple of questions ago about the importance of execution and also volumes, rate increases, and we\u2019re all sitting here waiting for free cash flow per share to get into the double digits and into the mid-teens perhaps, what\u2019s the timeframe, when do you have the confluence of this rising execution and at the same time, the volumes that will drive \u2013 that long awaited steeper slope in the cash flow, is this 2017 when you hit the next rate on the narrow body, because the 787 component of it seems to be moving a little bit to the right here when you said earlier, sometime in the 2015 time frame 787-8 goes breakeven \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when should we be thinking about a change in the slope on the free cash flow curve?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, as I say, you are going to\u2013 we\u2019re going to see growth next year and expect to see growth thereafter and it\u2019s really again executing on the production rates. Now, once you get to a peak rate, I would say that\u2019s where you really maximize the cash flow of just the basis of the elements of driving the cash flow between progress payments and delivery payments. So, once we get to peak rate is really where you should see the real potential or peak potential from the company and then again the partnering for success and the other initiatives more mature out in that time frame.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But, again, the top line is pretty solid, when you look, we know the rates, we know we need to do execute on far fewer than what we\u2019ve had to, but \u2013 and we\u2019re making investments today. We\u2019re making investments in that growth whether it\u2019s 787-10 or whether that\u2019s MAX or 777X. So, obviously those investments will peak in as they get, I\u2019ll take kind of the [key minus] (ph) entry into service and so there\u2019ll be some offset there. But, again we continue to see a strong cash flow profile going forward driven on those elements of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. But, Greg, how do we factor in the fact that your peak rates keep moving to the right and not because they are delayed, they just keep getting higher?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that rates have moved to the right, they moved up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s what I mean getting higher. So, you have new peaks further out at higher levels?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And continued investment to get there. So, it\u2019s a little \u2013 when you\u2019re talking about maturing at a peak rate, are we talking about the 10 per month on the 787, the 12, the 14, the 42, the 47, or the 52 on the narrow body, how do we think about, what\u2019s a peak rate, what\u2019s a mature rate?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think all of those are going to come into play, and as you know, they\u2019re all pretty much staggered throughout that next five-year period, but when you talk about investments as an example, we\u2019ve already made the investments, [these are] (ph) accounted for the investments that go into 52 a month on the 737. So, again I think this is a demonstration of the strength of the market and the strength of the portfolio and again, I wouldn\u2019t call it moving investments or moving rate to the right, it\u2019s more moving rates up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I wasn\u2019t trying to suggest they are delayed, I meant going higher. Just a quick one for Jim. Jim, we\u2019ve seen a lot of movement in the price of oil here, and I know that airlines\u2019 fleet plan on a long-term basis, but at what price of Brent crude might we see some demand destruction?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the airlines \u2013 first of all, airlines tend to buy on the sort of the distribution around a mean. So, and above to all, that distribution is pretty wide. So, their behavior tends to be driven by that more than a point (indiscernible). Having said that, our analysis shows the price of oil could still fall a long way before our planes are anything other than compelling economically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, this generation of new planes that we\u2019re introducing anywhere from 16% to 24% more efficient than the planes they are replacing, this replacement generation is it has more compelling numbers associated with than any generation I\u2019ve seen since the 707. So, our analysis \u2013 we (indiscernible) on both interest rates and price of oil and you got to go a long way from where we are now before you begin to see even incremental impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Spingarn \u2013 Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, just a clarification question for you and then one for Jim as well. On the clarification, can you just talk about or clarify the cadence of cash and deferred on the 787, is it the case that the 787-8, 787-9 move into a profitable state as the 787-10 is ramping up and therefore, things kind of stabilize, is that the right way to think about things on the 787?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s a combination or certainly getting to 12 a month, getting the 787-9 rate up are really the stabilizing factors obviously and continue to come down the learning curve internally and then the step down pricing on the supply chain are really the big drivers in there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. But then offsetting that will be some deferred build on the 787-10, is that right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Correct. Yes. Like I said, you know, if there\u2019s opportunities to pull some of this forward and I\u2019ll say verified in the production system, we\u2019re certainly going to do that as we have with the 787-9 and as you\u2019ve seen it has been very successful. But, that\u2019s kind of a quarter-by-quarter, month-by-month decision that we\u2019ll make as we get closer to those products moving into the production system, but 12 a month is a big milestone on deferred production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Gursky \u2013 Citi</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. And, Jim, the question for you is just the phrase productivity gains and partnering for success (indiscernible) throughout this call, give us an update on where we are with partnering for success and what you at this point knowing what you know about the success of that program to date and the productivity gains that you\u2019re seeing \u2013 what kind of margin expansion opportunity do we have here for the commercial business in particular?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, you\u2019re seeing the beginnings of the impact now in the margins you\u2019re seeing in our businesses. So, pretty robust margins, we have plans to keep them in that neighborhood at least and I would say we\u2019re still in the first 25% of this initiative. We\u2019ve probably matured deals with somewhat over a third of our supply base, there is discussions with another third and then there\u2019s another third that we\u2019re jousting with a little bit. So, seeing the beginning of the impact now, still a lot more in front of us than behind us and I think it is going to be fundamental not only to our profitability but also the profitability of the people we work with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, we\u2019re taking cost out of our mutual business activities and those that are working with us are getting in many cases more volume from us part of the arrangement. So, this all gives us more flexibility on either taking it in margin or using it in price of the marketplace when we face those situations, and if we hadn\u2019t have had this program, we wouldn\u2019t be able to respond properly and so we\u2019re going to keep pushing this one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jason Gursky <strong>\u2013 Citi</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll go to Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, maybe Greg, the advances, they were as a use of cash in the quarter \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019m coupling that with, I think the best commercial BCA bookings quarter in your history and certainly, I would imagine relative, in your prepared remarks said that orders are coming in well ahead of your expectations for the full year, so can you play out why advances aren\u2019t more of a source to your original benchmark for cash flow and [what\u2019s offsetting it] (ph)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. No, absolutely, I mean, as you know, on initial order, there is no lot of cash that comes with that initial order, most of the cash associated that\u2019s with progress payment. So, that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing an offset and it\u2019s purely just timing of progress payments one quarter to another. So, there\u2019s nothing else to read into that other than timing on progress payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In other words, there is no help that you\u2019re getting from the outside sort of activity for your guidance on cash flow?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. No, I wouldn\u2019t say and you\u2019ll see more strength in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s where you\u2019ll definitely see some timing in there. And then as we talked about, you got a little bit of inventory when you look at it on a net basis, inventory build up on 737 and 787 that are also offsetting that. But, again I would \u2013 I just equate that to purely timing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one clarification, the C17, is that a cash headwind to this year on [white tails] (ph) or is it all virtually into 2015 that we have to think about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. It\u2019s this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"> Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. It\u2019s this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Myles Walton \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"> Yes. Good morning, Jim and Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Peter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jim, you\u2019ve mentioned the last couple of years that the majority deliveries having gone for replacement versus growth, I wonder if we can just put a finer point on that about how long do you think that this window continues to exist where we are seeing the majority of deliveries go for replacement before we tread back to kind of the historical growth estimates that have been associated with deliveries?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, if you look back in history, history is sort of 75% growth, 20% to 25% replacement and starting with really the 787, it\u2019s the replacement has been double that. Okay. So, a real (indiscernible) has changed. So, about half replacement, half growth. I think you\u2019re going to see it continue for a while as the new technology we\u2019ve developed rolls through our model families. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, you\u2019re seeing it on the 787 today as it replaces the older medium sized wide-bodies and you\u2019re beginning to see it on the 777 as we spiral the number of those technologies now into the 777, you are beginning to see it on the MAX and so I think that\u2019s going to continue probably for another decade or so with a more robust mix of replacement versus growth which is the good thing about us in the sense that it will keep us disconnected from over all GDP trends. This is what gives us a multiplier on GDP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think it\u2019s, and it all stems from the inventiveness of our people and staying out in front of the marketplace and our competition in that regard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And just, if I could just follow up to that, one of the things that\u2019s been driver this has been the elevated fuel prices. So, I know to Rob\u2019s question about you would have to go a lot lower, but someone analysis kind of indicate that you saw oil at $70 for an extended period, you see some destruction, is that the only thing number materially below that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, we would not see much impact at $70, okay. And it would have to be much difference than $70.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on our analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Peter Arment \u2013 Sterne Agee</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for one more analyst question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that will be from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Noah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe since I am last, I\u2019ll do one more deferred question, I guess I\u2019m wondering, now that you\u2019re at $25 billion, is it possible to more precisely pin down what the word approximate means in the approximately $25 billion and I know that\u2019s maybe [splitting] (ph) but I think a lot of your stakeholders really care if it is going to really kind of hover around $25 billion while it\u2019s flat before coming down or if it needed to be $26 billion or $27 billion before it comes back down. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in that answer, if you could also address since the inventory pull forward that you\u2019re doing which makes sense was unanticipated and not in the original plan, are there any other potential new strategies that could come about that you could tell us about that we could in front of?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean that\u2019s certainly the 787-10. I mean, if we have an opportunity to do that for all the reasons I talked about on the 787-9, we\u2019ll absolutely do it and that\u2019s supporting profitable growth going forward and it\u2019s a risk reduction and it is absolutely the right thing to do and again, I think the 787-9 performance demonstrates that. And so, that\u2019s probably the one that comes to mind where we \u2013 if we have opportunities, we will. It could impact near term deffered, but I\u2019ll say a long-term productivity and profitability for the program will benefit as a result of that and ultimately cash flow. You know, on the deffered, a year ago, I said approximately $25 billion, there is obviously been a lot of moving pieces within that number and the 787-9 performance on a unit cost basis and I think try to give you some color on the progress that\u2019s being made there, they are making good progress, so expect to make more absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We would like it happen faster absolutely, seems very focused on it and then making rate, and the team has done a good job on making rate and then the suppliers step down. So, all of those sentiments within deffered are being managed all around profitability and cash flow. Quarter to quarter, they are going to change. There is no question about that depending on what\u2019s taking place in the production or where we can pull forward certain elements even if 787-8 inventory if we compose (indiscernible) we pull that in at the same time. So it\u2019s going to more around, Noah, but as we enter into more 787-9 and we have the opportunity again to risk mitigate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll do that as well, but we\u2019re managing it obviously with a weighted focus mindset on cash generation and long term profitability and cash generation for the program over the long term. So, yes, there is near term decisions that you\u2019re going to see but they are absolutely the right thing to do to drive again solid growth on both top line and bottom line for the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. I guess given we\u2019re over \u2013 a little over $25 billion, we\u2019re not breakeven yet on 787-8. We\u2019re pulling forward a little more on 787-9. We have yet pulled forward on 10 each of those being a couple of hundred million dollars. It sounds like the approximate could translate to $1 to $2 billion rather than $100 million to $200 million. Is that a fair assessment or is that too large?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think it\u2019s certainly, we\u2019re going to continue to do this quarter over quarter, I mean I certainly don\u2019t see a profile to get to $2 billion, but it\u2019ll depend on the decisions we make on pull forward and if we decide to do that and our continued focus on unit costs, so obviously it\u2019s about making rate and coming down on the unit cost and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on that. But like I said, is all about making investments now that have \u2013 ensure that we have long-term profitable growth on the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We hope next year on a cash flow basis on the program, it certainly will be much better than what it was this year and again, it\u2019s all those things that we\u2019ve talked about and during 2015 we expect to be cash positive on the program. So we\u2019re going to continue to execute on that and I would say kind of continue the productivity enhancements that the team has developed on the program that again really benefit not as much today, but definitely next year or next month or next quarter and following years to stabilize the production system and maximize the efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Noah Poponak \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You are welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen that completes the analyst question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I will now return you to the Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Thomas J. Downey</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any other questions after the session ends, please call our Media Relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. And in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And first go to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Cameron \u2013 Wall Street Journal</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, Jim and Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"> Good morning, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Cameron \u2013 Wall Street Journal</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the defense side, actually this bridges both parts of the business, you previously indicated in regulatory filings that you may make a decision on [a big chunk] (ph) in St. Louis in the sort of first, second quarter of 2013 time frame, given the transfer or upon transfer of some commercial work there in Wichita as well, I wonder if that sort of decision-making time frame is still valid, or in fact, bringing the commercial work in fact may change your mind, regardless of what happens on the military side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the key factors around any significant decision around St. Louis eventually gets to F-15 and F-18 production. We are pleased to see in the current budget proposal that F-15s are supported in the FY-15 budget which takes us out through the end of 2017, the international orders on F-15 take us beyond that. Now, that\u2019s not yet etched in stone with our government, so could there be a significant decision first part of 2015?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Does it look if we may be able to navigate through that? Yes. But I wouldn\u2019t want to say categorically that a decision wouldn\u2019t have to be made at that time. Obviously, longer term, Long Range Strike is a program that we think we are well positioned to win which would certainly St. Louis over the longer term perturbation we would have face into shorter term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Julie Johnsson \u2013 Bloomberg News</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, a quick question on 747-8, just wondering if there are any plans to reconsider the 1.5 per month rate this year, given what we\u2019re seeing with sales and the dwindling backlog?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we were pleased to see that the cargo market growth has accelerated and in this last quarter is up. Our best analysis as we sit here today says that the marketplace will support the rates that we have in place. The macro picture is improving, we\u2019ll just to have to look at it every quarter and make a decision for the Boeing Company. But for right now, we see \u2013 we think we are in the right spot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next go to Dominic Gates with the Seattle Times.

We\u2019ve also got news that Airbus maybe looking at a longer range version of A321 which may make it even more attractive. So, you\u2019ve always insisted you end up with 50-50 or approximately that, can you elaborate on where that\u2019s going and how you see that happening?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dominic, you are breaking up a little bit. I think I got the question. Our view of where it will end up based on our discussions with customers based on our pipeline hasn\u2019t changed. I mean, you are right, we started a year-and-a-half behind the other guys. If you look at the trajectory of where we are at a similar point in time where they were, we are right, we are in a similar place. So the market share will be what market share will be, but our view hasn\u2019t changed on that at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator <br></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Alwyn Scott \u2013 Reuters</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W.

We keep hearing it\u2019s roughly a third are engaged, a third are sort of in the converting stage and a third, [you have] (ph) yet to engage. Can you explain why that \u2013 that\u2019s not \u2013 we are not yet seeing any real shift in getting more suppliers into the tent?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>W. James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I didn\u2019t mean to leave the impression that we are not making progress, because we are. I think if you take a granular look, a number of partners have \u2013 are working with us on our partnering for success basis. So I didn\u2019t want to leave the impression we are not making progress, we are. And I think it would be fair to say that over the last three to four months that another 10% of our partners have started working with us a concrete basis. Maybe that\u2019s a better way to answer that question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have one last question in the queue and we will take that now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019ll be<strong> </strong>Steve Wilhelm with the Puget Sound Business Journal.

James McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I mean, it certainly is, we had a strong quarter, it really went across all the production programs. I mean, I haven\u2019t gone back and looked at whether it was a record or not, but it certainly goes to the focus that team has on driving the productivity and even to Jim\u2019s question prior on partnering for success and we are starting to see the benefit of that.
