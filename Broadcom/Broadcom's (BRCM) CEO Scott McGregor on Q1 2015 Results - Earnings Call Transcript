Broadcom delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2015. Revenue came in at the upper end of the guided range and non-GAAP EPS came in ahead of first call consensus. Reportable segment revenue and operating profit grew 11% and 23% year-over-year respectively consistent with our objective of driving profitable growth. Broadcom\u2019s business units are performing well. Broadband and connectivity saw a double-digit percentage growth year-over-year in both revenue and operating profit and delivered revenue ahead of expectations in the March quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Connectivity upside was driven by successful new smartphone launches an increasing penetration of 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions. We\u2019ve now seen two consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth in our connectivity portfolio. In infrastructure, year-over-year growth has been driven by our world class switch products in the data center and enterprise markets. I\u2019ll go into these items in more detail later in the call, but first turn the call over to Eric for detailed on our first quarter results and on our second quarter guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Brandt</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Scott. As Peter mentioned, please refer to the data breakout in the investor section of our Web site for additional information that will supplement my financial commentary. As a reminder, we're now including stock-based compensation in our non-GAAP operating results, in addition to allocating it to our reportable segments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q1 came in at $2.06 billion, up 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding cellular base band revenue, reportable segment revenue was up 11% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 54.4%, up 250 basis points year-over-year. Q1 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Q1 R&amp;D plus SG&amp;A expense of $716 million, is down over a $100 million from a year ago and up $13 million from Q4. Reportable segment operating margin was 20%, up nearly 200 basis points year-over-year, consistent with our plan to drive profitable growth. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.64 per share or $0.04 above first call consensus of $0.60 per share. Q1 GAAP EPS was $0.34 per share which includes $0.23 of impairment charges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cash flow from operations used $25 million in Q1. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $5.5 billion. I\u2019ll provide additional commentary on this in a moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to revenue and gross margin. In January, we said we expected Q1 revenue of $2 billion plus or minus $75 million. We delivered revenue just below the high end of the range at $2.06 billion. Our broadband and connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectations at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Upside was driven by wireless connectivity and broadband modems. Our infrastructure and networking revenue was $631 million, up 6% year-over-year. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was down 30 basis points from Q4 to 54.4% within our guided range of 54.7% plus or minus 75 basis points</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Q1 GAAP gross margin was flat from Q4 at 52.8%. Moving to operating expenses. Total R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses for Q1 were in line with our guidance. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Cash flow from operations used $25 million. In April 2015, we transitioned to a new enterprise resource planning system, in preparation we intentionally took certain measures that impacted our cash flow from operations in the three months ended March 31, 2015 by over $400 million. We built additional inventory and paid certain liabilities earlier than we otherwise would have helping using this transition. We expect this to reverse in the coming quarters. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cash and marketable securities ended Q1 at $5.5 billion of which 46% is in the U.S. During the quarter we paid $84 million in dividends and repurchased $8 million shares of stock at a cost of roughly $350 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As previously discussed in our 10-K regarding the construction of our new corporate campus, in Q1 we paid a $156 million for the purchased of lands and related prepaid assets. Q1 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 36 days and net inventory returns 6.2. Moving to impairment of the purchased intangibles. During the quarter we recorded impairment charge off to $143 million or $0.23 per share, primarily related to our net logic acquisition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impairment was principally driven by a reduction in size of the addressable market for merchant KVPs. For further discussion of the proceedings charges, please see our 10-Q that we anticipate filing today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to expectations. We currently expect net revenue in Q2 to be $2.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Segment perspective, sequentially we expect broadband and connectivity to be flat to up slightly and infrastructure networking to be up. We expect Q2 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly 56% plus or minus 75 basis points and GAAP gross margin to be about 0.5 lower. We expect R&amp;D and SG&amp;A expenses in Q2 to be down roughly $15 million plus or minus $10 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now I would like turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the stay of the business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott McGregor</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Eric. Staring with our broadband and connectivity business revenue came in at $1.41 billion, up 13% year-over-year and down 4.5% sequentially. Offset in the quarter was primarily driven by wireless connectivity and broadband access. Our connectivity business continues to strengthen, we've seen two sequential quarters of year-over-year revenue growth driven by consumer adoption of new high end phones, growing penetration of new technologies, such as 802.11ac and 2x2 and the ramp of new highly integrated products, such as our location hub that all direct higher ASPs. We\u2019re seeing significant customer interest in our latest 5G Wi-Fi chip that offers an industry first real simultaneous dual band or RSDB. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This technology is expected to ship later this year and allows a Smartphone or tablet to transfer data across two bands at the same time enabling new applications increasing performance of existing applications. We also expect our new location hub product that enables always-on location based application; we\u2019ll broaden out to more customers and phone models over the course of this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also in Smartphone's we\u2019re seeing a lot of activity in the internet of things market. We shipped a large number of WICED development kit, which are a complete hardware and software solution for prototyping IoT products. We continue to garner our new design winds in a broad set of verticals ranging across automotive, medical devices, healthcare, life goods and home automation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In broadband, growth is being driven by [PCD] and broadband access subscriber editions in emerging markets, technology upgrades to video cell with vectoring and bonding and the proliferation of PON technology in China. On a year-over-year basis combine revenue from set top box and broadband modems were up double digit percentages, while broadband modems actually grew sequentially versus a typical seasonal decline in Q1. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward we see growth drivers including emerging markets, new media server architectures and new technologies such as ultra HD and HEVC. Ultra HD and HEVC are still in the early adoption phase and are expected to drive growth for many years to come. Finally our emerging business of home networking and small cells are expected to be solid growth drivers as well. We are excited about the recent announcement that Cisco will be partnering up with spider cloud to deliver Broadcom based small cell solutions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Looking into Q2, we expect our broadband and connectivity business to be flat to up slightly sequential. Moving to infrastructure revenue in our infrastructure and networking group came in as expected at $631 million up 6% year-over-year and slightly up sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven primarily by our switch and [five] products in the datacenter and enterprise markets. On a sequential basis our enterprise growth was driven by ramps in new product introductions the customers where we expect to gain market share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our switching business delivered record revenue and better than seasonal growth in the March quarter. We recently started sampling next generation products in the StrataDNX and to StrataXGS family. In the StrataDNX family new products target datacenter and service provider applications and will help drive transitions from in house basics to merchant solutions. Broadcom introduced eight new switch products over the past year to even further extend and strengthen our portfolio. Yesterday we announce Trident II plus, which is a pin-for-pin compatible upgrade to our Trident II switch chip targeting 10 gig and 40 gig datacenter applications and it offers lower power and an enhanced feature set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These products are complementary to our Tomahawk solution that targets 25 gig data center application and which is well on its way towards production shipment later this year. As we look into Q2, we expect our infrastructure and networking business to be up sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, we saw a strong start to 2015, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS ahead of expectations in the first quarter and see solid trends into Q2. We saw year-on-year profitable growth in both of our reportable segments in the March quarter as broadband and connectivity and infrastructure and networking delivered operating profit ahead of revenue growth. These results reflect our business objective to deliver top-line growth along with operating margin leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This concludes our prepared comments and now we\u2019re ready for your questions. Leslie may we have the first question please?</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wonder if you can talk little bit about the 56% gross margin in a longer term contacts, I mean is there going to be a continue to be a lift to gross margin as you see the networking make shift or just how should we think about the long-term trajectory there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Joe, its Eric. I would say look Q2 certainly a strong quarter, we are comfortably in the range of the 54 to 57 we said at Analyst Day. I think broadly, I think our view of gross margin hasn\u2019t changed although Q2 tends to be a little bit richer both due to bit of an E&amp;O turnaround, good cost management and good solid mix of growth of infrastructure in Q2, similarly Q3 is a little bit higher on the consumer product side. So that\u2019s a little less rich, but comfortably -- well comfortably within the range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then follow up on the connectivity side, are you -- what are you seeing for your kind of Wi-Fi centric ASPs this year, will there be pressure or is there enough kind of migration to new technology just sort of offset the normal pricing pressure that you would see in Wi-Fi?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have a lot of opportunity to offset the normal ASP pricing pressure because of migration to new technology. So, I would say we still have quite a ways to go, we\u2019re probably in the fourth or fifth innings on just the AC conversion in general, but we have these new technologies like the one I just mentioned the RSDB which again is an ASP uplift. And then we\u2019re also able to integrate additional things in there, for example the sensor hub I mentioned, that really does a great job in terms of reducing power and other things in devices and that\u2019s just beginning to ship in some new phones. So, I think we\u2019ve got a great opportunity there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by the way, I mentioned that we\u2019ve had two sequential quarters of year-over-year growth in connectivity, our expectation is in Q2, we\u2019ll probably put a third quarter of year-over-year growth in our connectivity business just to show you the kind of strength we\u2019re seeing there and it's an ongoing basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Congratulations on the solid quarterly execution, in June your guiding infrastructure are working up sequentially, if I assume that broadband and connectivity is relatively flat, your networking business is going to grow almost 10% sequentially in Q2, I assume that most of that is data center driven. But can you just talk directionally about what you're also seeing in your enterprise and the service provider segment and maybe some color on the product level in terms of what\u2019s driving the growth in June for networking?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Harlan, I am not sure on your number, you might want to check that. But definitely the ING business is up and that business is performing extremely well. We\u2019re seeing little bit of a pause in the service provider segment, but the enterprise and data center business is definitely strong there. We got new product introductions and quite a good pipeline of things there. So all of those contributing to drive that business and seeing a lot of strength there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Eric on OpEx front again another quarter of slightly lower than expected expenses versus the midpoint, so nice job on the discipline. You guys were guiding OpEx to step down by 15 million in Q2, normally we would expect an increase for employee related benefits and [indiscernible], is this just more cost and expense discipline and then how should we expect OpEx to turn to the second half of the year? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure Harlan, so good type cost discipline on the company\u2019s part. I would say, as you look into Q2 what sort of underneath the covers is that we are managing our employee cost to be relatively flat. So we have the merit going up and the fringe coming down and no additional cost, we\u2019re actually able to manage it pretty flat. What\u2019s driving the down actually was we had a very high mass quarter in Q1 and so it\u2019s sort of lumpy and rolls sort of up and down. So sort of up-down, up-down it's hard to project exactly when the masks occur. So Q2 is down maybe Q3 is back up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But again sort of broadly type management on expenses and I would say generally speaking my view sort of the OpEx for the year is about what I thought it was maybe even a little bit favorable to what I\u2019ve said prior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Seymore </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Scott, first a bigger picture question from you, there is lots of questions in the market about slowing demand especially on the infrastructure side, wireless infrastructure. Are you seeing any choppiness in your ING group that you could breakout between say the data center and the service provider side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s a regional phenomenon Ross. We see and we read the headlines definitely there is some lower CapEx from some of the carriers in United States. But on the other hand we\u2019re seeing offsets by strength in China for example; infrastructure is still continuing to go quite well there. So, I've seen that's more of a regional phenomenon and we have that more balanced across our business and it\u2019s certainly included in our guidance numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Seymore </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And I guess as my guess my follow up a quick one for you Eric. You mentioned how there are some one off items that made the inventory go up and the cash flow turn negative from a cash flow from operations perspective. Is there any color, you can provide to us and how we should think about that cash generation going forward just from a one off basis not about longer term revenue guidance or anything from that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. So, basically I would expect the cash flow to normalize mostly in a quarter back to what it was, so what your projections to the full year excluding those effects the cash flow from operations, but when you look at the cash flow statement I will tell you, you can see it, you can see inventories up about a $100 million, you can see AP is up about $60 million, but if you look at what seasonally it should be would have been about 14 days and that could be a 140 to 150, so somewhere between that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the other place would be other accrued liabilities, where you see a very significant negative effect to the cash flow and that's basically because we prepaid or early paid a north of $200 million of rebase in the quarter. So that's where the places are and those things should reverse themselves, certainly the payables and the rebased in a quarter and the inventory at least in the quarter maybe a smidge longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Still a very strong cash flow quarter in Q2. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Seymore </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C.J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess two questions around operating model. First off in terms of operating margins for broadband and connectivity down roughly 470 bps and presumably that strength in connectivity, curious if you could talk through how you see the trajectory for that line items through the year and then as a follow up question to that implied guide for Q2 is basically above the midpoint of your target model for operating margins and roughly 22.5% give our take. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Curious if you look at that and maybe on the mix side of broadband and connectivity improving could we be hitting the 24% Op margin target exceeding the year or how should we think about that? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah C.J. its Eric. So, first of all on the margin side business unit, the right way to look at it because of the seasonality that's in our business is Q1 to Q1, so if you look at broadband and connectivity Q1 to Q1, we\u2019re actually up year-over-year by about 230 basis point and ING infrastructure by about 140 basis points, which is what's contributing to the aggregate year-over-year of almost 200 basis points up and that's sort of gives you the sense of the leverage and profitability of the businesses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The real sort of answer to your question is sort of what's your view of the overall market is, I think we will manage our expenses consistent with what I've said in the past and what I said just the few moments ago and so to the extent that the revenue continues to do better than we had anticipated certainly in Q1 and given the strong guidance in Q2 I think there\u2019s additional leverage to the operating model over the course of the year, but hard to make that call since we only guide one quarter out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Srini Pajjuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Thank you. Scott on the connectivity side I think you said we are in the fourth or fifth innings of the AC transition, I'm just wondering where we are in terms of 2x2 transition and also I think last quarter, you weren't really sure if connectivity will grow on this year for the full year and given what's you are seeing right now has your expectation change for the full year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Srini. I guess I don\u2019t have the exact inning on where we are with 2x2. Peter where do you think the inning is on two by two?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Peter Andrew</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Srini let\u2019s follow with that on Q&amp;A afterwards and I can try to dig up something.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll calculate an inning for you. Overall connectivity is definitely strengthening from where we thought it was a quarter or two ago and we've said that we expected that business will likely decline this year in the past; I would say our view at this point is it will probably be flat or even up on a year-over-year basis, than as I mentioned Q4 was up year-over-year, Q1 was up year-over-year, Q2 we believe is going to be up year-over-year, that business is going quite strong and so a lot of the concerns we had about loss of that business on exiting base band have not materialized and we don't expect them to at this point. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We see another benefit which is a number of the folks who we partner with our gaining share in the base band space and so that also helps our penetration and actually enables us to gain share whereas I think a lot of people were modeling we would lose share and it's actually going the other way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Srini Pajjuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great and then on the broadband side Scott, I guess you know there is some concern in the market that because of the M&amp;A there could be some slowdown. I think at least one of your customer kind of mention that. I'm just wondering are you seeing any impact from all the M&amp;A talk out there and then if not how should we think about some of the puts and takes in this business, as we look out to the next two to three quarters?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That's a fair question, but it's certainly not showing up on our numbers. I mean we have very broadband performance, I think it's again a little bit like, I answer a previous question about carrier CapEx, it tends to be more of a regional thing. And so we do see a little bit of hesitation from some of the MSOs in the United States, as they look at mergers or seeing corresponding with our strength in other regions, South America and Asia and around the world China all of those are showing strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I do believe that as that settles to be a net positive for us because a lot of the mergers will enable those operators to really feel stronger products out there as they look to moving faster to HEVC and 4K. And so that probably give us an opportunity to have higher ASPs in the boxes going forward. So, I\u2019d say right now in the U.S. maybe it's a bit of a pause offset by other regional strength and going forward probably a net positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Delaney </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the first question I was hoping you can give some more color on the switching market and maybe you could provide some detail about the pace of design wins or engagements on Tomahawk relative to some of the prior generation product launches either qualitatively over the same metrics you can provide? And similarly if you could just give us some an update on the market-share opportunity in switching not only with merchant chips but also if you can talk about the ASIC opportunity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The switching business is doing really well and I think in our StrataDNX business and particularly we\u2019ve got an opportunity for -- opportunity to move to merchant\u2019s silicon from some of the customer on ASIC, so good opportunity there. Tomahawk going really well, I think that\u2019s something that sort of must have for customers it's a really great product, strong specs and is out in the market now. We believe that customers are moving very rapidly to bring those products to market, so all-in-all quite strong. Actually, I think the DNX potential is even bigger than Tomahawk. So Tomahawk of course is a great product doing extremely well in the market, but I think you want to also focus on those DNX products probably financially bigger opportunities for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Delaney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And for follow-up question on the broadband business, my understanding was a lot of the opportunity around 4K TV and HEVC encoding was maybe somewhat of a 2015 event but more 2016 and beyond, just given some of the upside that you're seeing, do you think you can start to see the further growth in broadband in second half of \u201915 around 4K TVs as HEVC or is just more of a longer term opportunity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it's an opportunity that will probably become more significant next year. But the key thing about that is that if you want to win a design today you really have to have leading products with HEVC and 4K, all of the designs and decisions being made on what platforms and architectures are all based on your strength in that space and Broadcom was the first there and early in that technology and so that\u2019s enabled us to win a lot of the next generation. So those designs a lot of them are already won and you\u2019ll start to see those rollout over the course of time and it's certainly good for us because it's higher ASP opportunity and also opportunity to win some customers we didn\u2019t have before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So especially outside of the United States it's an opportunity for share gains and we talked about that as driver for us in the past to get geographical share gain there and certainly the 4K transition has accelerated that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Doug Freeman with RBC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Freeman </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I could dig into a topic that you\u2019ve already touched on a little bit and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in the switch market. Can you maybe talk to us in terms of share and how much of the market you think has converted to merchant solutions to give us some sense of what you think the runaway for that business looks like as you try to push more of the market towards merchant?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think there is a tremendous opportunity to increase our share there. There is still a fair number of ASICs and we\u2019ve done a good job I think in terms of providing solutions that are really compelling. So, we have most of the customers with at least one Broadcom solution today. But I really think there is an opportunity to show that we can really cover a broader range of switch products and some of those customers we only have fairly small beachhead to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think we do have an opportunity for continued gains there as we go forward. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, I mean we\u2019ve launched eight new switch shifts this year and I think that\u2019s a really important differentiator that isn\u2019t well understood. We have some competitors out there that talk about their switch chip and we\u2019ve launched just eight in the last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think if you really want to get broad coverage in the market, the broad -- we have multiple families of devices, and switches and fabrics. And it enables us to really tune those products to particular segments of the market and really create optimize products. And so I think that will give us a very strong proposition in all those markets going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have two quick ones, first around the margin trajectory. As you mentioned you seem to be up pretty decently year-over-year, I think last year in Q3 you were pretty darn close to 24% which is the high end of your guidance, given your I guess outlook for OpEx trajectory and growth of this point of year would you still expect your margins at the company level to continue to be up year-over-year as you go through the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly on inventories, I know you built this quarter and I understand that typically inventories will be up in Q2 that will be normal, given your views on what\u2019s going to happen with the balance sheet and the cash flow; would you expect that inventory number in Q2 this time to be down?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Stacy, its Eric. So first of all on the margins trajectory, I think really it does depend on your view of revenue in seeing Q3 and sort of the mix of that revenue as it relates to gross margin, so to the extent that it\u2019s a very strong consumer quarter, which it typically is as we pre-build into the holiday season, as I said full [rich] and then what we currently see. So, it's very much of revenue dependent question and I don't have any answer on the revenue for Q3 at this point, since we only do one at a time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of inventory target certainly, we would not -- we would like our turns to move back up to where they've been before sort of closer to seven, so I think you can sort of build it off of that, does that mean that the inventory goes down and really does, so it depend on the overall sort of cost of goods, but I think there is a chance we can have inventory moved down certainly, I don't think it would go up any meaningful amount, although again, so it depends on how strong we expect to see in Q3 to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is Romit Shah with Nomura.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Romit Shah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. Great results. Yeah the headlines from me is the in the OpEx decline here in the second quarter and Eric you mentioned that mass cost were higher in Q1, but total OpEx for last quarter also came in below what I was modeling, so I was hoping you could just give us a little bit more color on what's happening with expenses and along those lines can you also comment on stock base comp at 90 million, is there additional leverage share? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So, in terms of Q1 relative to Q4, I would say things came in pretty much as we had expected. We we're up roughly $20 million in employee cost minus the reduction of the cellular people that left between Q4 and Q1, so in Q4 we had about 200 people left principally statutory people and Q1 we sort of ended with about 15 people, so that knocked out about a couple of $3 million to $4 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Stock based compensation was favorable as you can see from the data it's down about $6 million to $7 million quarter-on-quarter and I expect stock based compensation to be relatively flat going into Q2, pretty flattish for the year. The only wild card on stock based compensation is we have a two year employee stock purchase plan, which comes up in Q4 of this year, which could have some changes good but not significant. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that's sort of what was going on. It was a pretty strong take out quarter, we were up meaningfully in take outs so we had some offsets in Q1 from NRE which we are anticipating, but again rolling into Q2, I expect you'll see that number come down and probably the best way to look at it is the page that we provide in the queue or the tables we provide in the queue and look at the design development cost they look relatively flat but again underneath that is pretty big take outs in one quarter offset by some NRE going into Q2 probably with a fair bet less on the take outside because again it's lumpy based on sort of the timing when these programs get done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Timothy Arcuri with Cowen Inc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot. Scott, the question is really just big picture, how you think about the possible impact of FX sort of on customer demand IT spending. Do you think that we've seen the impact of that or do you think would sort of yet to see the impact of that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don't think we either are seeing or going to see much impact on that. We certainly have all our pricing worldwide in dollars and so it doesn't effect as directly in terms of our own prices. I mean the only FX that we see are some of our cost that we carry for some of our non U.S. themes in OpEx. But when I look at the lot of our international customers many of our customers in Europe for example ship to a worldwide market, so we\u2019ll ship to a customer in Europe and then they will sell to a customer in South America, who is denominated in dollars and so we we're just not seeing that as a factor. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I know some other companies may cite that, but we don't see that as a significant contributor to our results so far or really much going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Chris Caso with Susquehanna Financial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Caso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. With respect to the connectivity business in the past you've talked about this $500 million to $800 million of business that that would decline overtime -- over the long term. Is that still your view that this long term decline would still occur but yet it's differed or are you a bit more optimistic about that business? Understand that some of the benefit you are seeing now is the result of some customer platform decisions; I guess is long term trajectory in that business depending on the permanence of some of those decisions, is that the right way to think about it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well remember that number was a theoretical worst case number and we wanted to do that just to paint what would happen if we lost all of the low and mid-range in connectivity and again as a hypothetical number that could have happen, but what we're seeing is not only do that not happen, but we're actually gaining share in that segment and I think it's sustainable again because a lot of the partners we work with on connectivity, who have there on base bands are actually gaining share versus some of the base spend guys who we don't partner with. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, an opportunity to gain share there, we did highlight that there was about a $100 million worth of business that was direct attached to our base band and that would depend on who won that business. It turns out most of the people who won that business we're partners with us on connectivity, so instead of selling connectivity with our own base band we now saw that same connectivity with a partner\u2019s base band. So, I would say that the theoretical worst case not only did not materialize but we\u2019ve grown since then as you seen by two so far consecutive year-over-year increases and a likely third consecutive year-over-year increase in our connectivity business since existing the base band business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Scott you mentioned the DNX product, where are you in the product cycle here, I mean when do you expect to see the volume ramps and to what extend is this product replacing an existing Broadcom product versus penetrating the Greenfield opportunity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We definitely have DNX product shipping today and there good products and a lot of those came from our original acquisition of Dune and we expect that these new products will enable us to broaden the market in terms of getting more merchant silicon versus internal ASICs in customers. So there is an opportunity to broaden the market that way, they are also more optimize for different market segments and so it allows us to I think really have a more competitive product stack in switch fabric area. So those are great products and yes of course the new ones replace our old one, but at the same time they grow the market much bigger than it was prior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Clarification and big picture question. On the clarification, Eric, very strong buybacks this quarter 335 million, but we didn\u2019t see the share count go down as; I was just wondering if that\u2019s a timing thing and how should we think about share count and the buyback trajectory for the rest of the year? And then the big picture question for Scott, Scott when I look at street expectations for Broadcom for the next two years, it sort of about 4% to 5% annual growth, I know you don\u2019t guide out more than a quarter, but is that 4% to 5% acceptable top-line growth for Broadcom or do you think that ones the baseband numbers are out Broadcom should be able to grow in line or better than the semiconductor market which is more like 6% to 7% a year? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well on your last question I certainly believe and it's our goal as a company is to outgrow the markets we\u2019re in, we believe the best way to deliver profitable growth is to deliver faster top-line than our market is growing and that allows us to get leverage on the bottom-line. And so we want to and for many, many years and for back in Broadcom\u2019s history, we have outgrown the markets and certainly our compensation plans are based on that and other things. But at the same time we want to make sure we get leverage from that growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it's going to depend little bit on how the semiconductor market does as a whole, but certainly we\u2019re motivated to do better than that, so to the extent the market does better than that, we would hope to do better as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Vivek on your buyback trajectory, yes you're right the effect of the share count growing quarter-on-quarter is due to the timing of the buyback versus the principally the option exercises in Q4 and Q1. So as I said we bought back 8 million shares but the buyback only registered in the quarter about three. So you should see the equivalent of five from the Q1 of that drop into Q2. But I would say the right way to think about this is, we committed to buyback at least double what we issue, we issue under 7 million shares in Q1 and we bought back eight and we\u2019re only roughly a third of the way through our buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have more to go and we\u2019ve try to take an advantage of doing it sooner rather than later because we have plenty of fire power to do so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Craig Ellis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Scott, a follow-up to Mark\u2019s question that\u2019s focused on some of the new products in networking infrastructure, the answer seem to describe the breadth -- the incremental breadth that those are providing in the marketplace. My question is more on the duration of the opportunity if I go back to Analyst Day, Rajiv had a slide that showed that the average revenue life for his products is around seven years with the ramp up going to the first three or four years, is that the way to think about these new products or is there something happening with the end markets now? The strength of data center for example hyper scaled that would really pull in that ramp profile?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the follow-up question would be for both you and Eric and that is with all of the M&amp;A activity that\u2019s continuing to share, does that cause Broadcom to think any differently about that strategy?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of your question, I think we certainly benefit from upward trends in the data center or service provider or enterprise markets and we\u2019ve seen different strengths from each of those segments, we\u2019re roughly one-third, one-third, one-third in each of those and so it's given us an opportunity there. But the new products that we\u2019re announcing today I think for us or for our competitors or anyone else it basically takes about a year from when you have your products in hand until the customer can ship in revenue. And then it takes a while for the revenue to ramp and then it persist over a long period of time if you have a good chip they don\u2019t need to replace if they run with them for a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you're right that Analyst Day slide I think is a really good example of that, what you're seeing is both the combination of strength in the markets and all the chips like Trident, the original Trident, the original Dune chips and other things that are really hitting their stride now in the middle of those periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that gives us the strength now and were now putting the design winds in place with an even broader set up products, which includes Tomahawk and the new DNX products and other things that really allows us to do that and so that's what enables us to get record switch revenue, that we saw in the quarter and above seasonal growth just with that combination of breadth of product portfolio now and several years back all adding up and giving us the strength fair and it's a very good leading indicator for in the next five years in that business this should be very strong for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of M&amp;A, we certainly look for opportunities Broadcom sweet spot on M&amp;A is as we look to buy small or medium size near revenue or early stage revenue companies, that's our sweet spot and we look for those, when we find good ones we buy them, we always look at other opportunities, but we haven't been as successful buying some larger things recently that hasn't worked out as well for us, so we're probably little more cautious on that and we been on the past, but certainly to the extent we find opportunities we think really create shareholder value, we will look at those and execute if they make sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Good afternoon guys congratulations on the strong results. Scott, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the infrastructure and networking business, the March and June quarter of this year are particularly difficult year-over-year comparison because the first half was so strong than in 2014 but when you look at the opportunity set in the back half of the year, do you think that business can return to double digit year-over-year growth and I'm kind of hoping you can differentiate between sort of enterprise datacenter and service provider, when you talk about that and is double digit growth sort of the right long term growth that you guys target?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think for the long term growth of the business, we definitely target double digit growth there. I think it's harder in any current year, because we're a little bit capped up by the CapEx expenditure in all three of those segments and there can be excogitates events such as M&amp;A going on in their spaces or spectrum issues or government spending, all kind of things that drive that that we don't control. So it's a little harder to be sure what's going to happen in the next few quarters, but I think we feel pretty comfortable on a multiyear basis, that that's a double digit grower for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ambrish Srivastava</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thank you, Scott. You answered the question I think Srini had asked about the connectivity and you address that in another follow up on the low end and the share loss you had anticipated earlier, but I wanted to switch the focus at high end. And the year has gone by when we used to ask you; beginning of the year you use to say, hey at the high end I feel comfortable keeping my share, but now that you have the sensor hub design win as well does that change and make your high end also stickier than in the past? That was my first question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the second one is really getting back to the discussion, which you had a while -- just moments ago on M&amp;A another impairment charge, why it dribs and dribble, what is happening that you are learning as you go by with the net logic business? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the connectivity question, I would say our high end business is as strong as ever. We have really competitive products there and I think what we've been able to successfully do is to continue to drive the technology road map forward in that space to create compelling offerings for our customers. The combination of that plus a really rich product family, where they can mix and match between all different kinds of combo and discrete products, adding things like sensor hub actually does make things more sticky because for example the censor hub is a perfect combination with GPS and to give you an example of why that makes sense is, if you think about a GPS in your phone it has to use a fairly significant amount of power to go get a fix on the satellites and determine a location and one of the things we can do by integrating the sensor hub, as we can integrate the data from all the accelerometers in the phone and conclude that you are sitting in your chair, you probably haven't move more than five feet and so you probably don't need to do on GPS fix and so by eliminating the need to do those location calculations and not having the wake up the main base band processor, that really saves a lot of power in the phone and it's a clear win. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that allows you to for example combine a sensor hub with the GPS into a very effective solutions, even though it's not immediately obvious with those would go well together; they do actually go very well together in terms of a better solution for the customers, so yes I would say our high end businesses as strong as ever. Erick you want to? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. On the impairment Ambrish, yes look our view would be too if we could do it once and call it a day, the truth of the matter is the way the accounting rules work is, you have to evaluate every time your forecast changes in a downward direction and in this case, as we see more AVP functionality being integrated into switches particularly our own, our view of the future has come down and as the view of the future comes down so does the overall carrying value or the present value of the cash flows, which is what triggers the impairment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We don't like this drip, drip, drip either. But it is a pretty formulate way to deal with it and I think the objective of the accounting community was to make sure that you have this visibility as things we're changing and that's principally the driver that changed discussed in the queue that we\u2019re filing today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But another perspective on that is the one of the reasons the addressable market came down as we believe a lot of the KDP functionality at least at the low end is getting integrated into switches. Now that\u2019s actually getting integrated into our switches, so you get a benefit in our own switch product and potentially ASP. But the accounting doesn\u2019t allow us to transfer value from KVP and uplift our switch business; you simply have to take the write-down in the KVP business. So it's a little funny in that sense and so just to give you a little more color on what\u2019s going on there in the moving parts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Matt Ramsay with Canaccord Genuity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to talk about a little bit of a bigger picture thing on those boundary side, [park] back to I think a couple of Analyst Days ago when Henry spoke about 28 nanometer being a very long lived node for maybe non-application processor type silicon, one of your customers is now ramping on since that specific volumes, I wonder how you see the world as far as when you [indiscernible] that node in and Broadcom moving down the node stack going forward versus that prior commentary of 28 being a pretty long live node for the company? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is an expression, there are horses for courses; and there are some products that make a lot of sense on some those and not on others. Things like processors, or big switches or fabric chips are very large chips, they are very performance sensitive and they are not as price sensitive and so those are chips that are prefect who go to a newer smaller node as quickly as we can. And so you should expect that we\u2019ll move our switch chips and other process intensive switch -- intensive devices to smaller nodes fairly quickly. On the other hand there are products that are either extremely cost sensitive or simply just don\u2019t get the benefit of the nodes, say like connectivity for example does not benefit by moving to \u201916 right now because the cost equation makes that unattractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we believe as Henry said that 28 nanometer will be a very long lived node for us, there will be products -- we\u2019ll probably still be doing products a few years from now on that node. But then some of our other more advance products will move quickly to other nodes. We do believe that we\u2019re beginning to see an end to the everything gets better, every process generation and in particular cost per transistor is one of the things that is starting to increase and if you don\u2019t need the performance improvement or require the shrink to get better yields on your chip or something, you\u2019ll probably stay a little further back in the nodes which I guess is good for the foundry folks because they can run their fabs longer and the depreciations equations probably a little better for them if they can run the nodes longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So a silver lining for our foundry partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Suji DeSilva with Topeka.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Suji DeSilva </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two questions; first of all on the sensor hub, is that product at just a handful of customers now and would you expect it to be kind of a few customers each quarter added on or is there kind of a movement toward it that might accelerate that into -- in the second half \u201915? And second question is on the infrastructure business, the data center part of it is there enough lumpiness potentially with the cloud customers that would also challenge your visibility into double-digit growth along with CapEx or is that small nothing, that\u2019s not that much of an issue? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So lumpiness in data center is definitely a factor, it makes it hard for us to predict. Now there is lumpiness in the other segments too. But definitely depends if one of our large massive data center customers is doing a huge build out of new servers that tends to give us a surge of orders. So it does tend to be -- there is about 10 customers who build really big data centers and so their timing can often affect that, making it hard to predict, I don\u2019t think it changes the longer term growth view with that business. But it makes it harder to predict quarter-by-quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your question on the sensor hubs, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the early days on that probably first inning on that and a great opportunity to go and obviously we\u2019ll hurry the game along and trying to get a lot runs in on that one, but I think it's a pretty attractive product and again you get a lot savings there. And I think you\u2019ll see us expand that concept and look for other ways to broaden it there. There was a question earlier about what inning are we in in 2x2 and so I think we\u2019re roughly in the third inning on that, so a great opportunity there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the net logic write-downs can you give us some ideal of the products that have been written down, what the current revenue run rate is and what\u2019s your growth expectations for these effective products might be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">David, we don\u2019t provide revenue on the specific products. The write-down related to the KVP business and if you're interested sort of how much intangibles we have on the books, we have about just around -- just under $500 million of intangibles on the book and most of that or better than half of that is related to the net logic, just to give you a sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham &amp; Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Quinn Bolton </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to ask relative position between Trident II plus and Tomahawk and specifically does Tomahawk requires for the infrastructure of 25 gigbit Ethernet to ramp before you see high volumes on Tomahawk? And then second question on connectivity, can you give us some sense where you see your connectivity test rate in China, is that still on pretty good level or is that sort of trended down with the media tech and switching mostly integrating the connectivity at this point? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Tomahawk versus Trident, we really target Tomahawk at the really high end of cloud guys and focused on 25 gig there and that's the real advantage of that products and so that tends to be designed into data centers going to 25 gig now those same customers are the ones who sphere head that movement to 25 gig, so that happens at the same time. Trident targeted more towards the enterprise customers for the 10 gig and 40 gig customers; we're looking for those kind of architecture. So again really tuning those products to the specific segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the connectivity business in China, I would say we're doing pretty well there. A lot of the indigenous Chinese customers are increasingly using our products in their high end phones and you used to think of phones in China mostly as low or mid-range, but if you look at the products coming out of Xiaomi or Huawei or Lenovo I mean a lot of those guys have decided they want to focus more on the high end market and they are doing great products. And so actually we've seen an increased opportunity in all those customers because as they look to build higher end products or they look to also support the export market outside of China, there really want the better specs that they get from our products and better carrier acceptance, since so that's been a very positive trend for us in China especially at the high end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next questions from Tristan Gerra with Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tristan Gerra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding this small scale market I think there was a lot of talk about a significant ramp a few years ago and it's probably fair to say it\u2019s been pushed out a little bit. When do you think this market becomes really meaningful and what is the potential at your top line that you see follow in a few years in that segment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the small scale market has done well versus our expectations, so I think there was some industry analyst forecast that we're pretty far out there and we didn't quite believe those, so if you look at it versus that maybe so but we've pretty happy with small cell deployments. Broadcom has shipped over two million small cells. To date Broadcom is the largest shipper of small cells out there, number one market share and we believe that market will continue to grow. Some carriers are very excited about them, some carriers let so, some carriers use them for additional coverage and some carriers use them for more urban capacity. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, this different business models out there that will shake out, we do see some customer that are using them alongside with set top box or other kinds of products they deploy to utilize fairly small amount of spectrum and create sort of a synthetic mesh-net if you will of cellular opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re optimistic on that business. I'm not sure I believe quite with some of the analyst were forecasting, but for us it's a good growth business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Christopher Roland with FBR Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Roland </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, what I've heard is that both T2 plus and Tomahawk they have support for a larger routing cables and this is going to allow the hyper scale guys to move from layer to switches to address layer three routers and stuff like end of row switches basically increasing your [TAM] out there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, to reference I think a switch might have a cost of like 30,000 a box, but a router might be five times that amount. So, I guess my question for you guys is will your switch content for those products or those end boxes, will it be the same for switches as a router or you are you going to get a content boost that's more inline and more proportional to the end equipment cost?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think your basic logic is right there. In terms of the applicability of our products. I mean certainly routers have much more capacity in terms of processing in terms of things like KVPs that you put in there for faster and larger tables, so I think your basic logic is right and that's the direction we\u2019re headed, can't speak to specific prices but definitely we have higher ASPs in the total solution, when you add up all of the switches, routers, [indiscernible], KDPs and other things that go into that box.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Hans Mosesmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for fitting me in. Hey, Scott you\u2019ve mentioned earlier that the DNX family of switches could actually be a bigger opportunity. Can you help us size up the XGS and the DNX Dune product? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can't give you more color than that, but I just wanted to help people understand that and we Tomahawk is a great opportunity, but DNX is even bigger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alright. Last question is from Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ruben Roy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I had a question on the broadband modem discussion Scott and it looks likes that was a quite a big year-over-year is that related to any specific infrastructure upgrades regionally or is it more of the broad based increased and how sustainable is that business going forward? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the business is sustainable going forward because of just everyone wanting to upgrade their connections. You now see for example the SEC in United States talking about much faster broadband speeds and other countries even more aggressive. One of our aspects of that is PON, the Passive Optical Networking that business in particular is doing well, we've seen record revenues on that and driven I think in large part by what\u2019s going on in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we\u2019ve seen above seasonal growth of PON in particular driven by China. And it's a little hard for us to read the TVs there but it seems like it's been going extremely, well maybe it will correct, but we also hear people who believe that\u2019s going to have many quarter still to go. So definite strength in that business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Blayne Curtis </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to Scott, you mentioned the A products and switching a lot of the questions on switching, just curious as to your thoughts on programmability. I know it's been a back and forth clearly maybe not a fit for every market, but just curious to your thoughts and if that would part of your road map? And then just Eric, just on the guidance for June is all of this other spend out of it at this point? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is a competitor saying that they are programmable and we\u2019re not and that\u2019s false. Broadcom\u2019s products are programmable too and then well are they more programmable and you get into these arguments. I mean our products are programmable to the extent that our customers need and we look to provide different ways to extend it, I mean programmability means it takes longer to get to market because you got more work to do, it means that it can have slower performance versus hardware assist. There are lot of trade-offs here, so it\u2019s a really complicated equation. But rest assure that our products all are programmable and beat the needs of our markets and to the extent we need to add it, that\u2019s not difficult for us to do and we can certainly do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think there is a little bit a false dilemma being painted in the market there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Blayne on cellular, you mean the bits and pieces on the OpEx is pretty much all gone it's negligible, you won\u2019t be able to really see it in the overall OpEx number and from a revenue perspective we did about 19 million this quarter Q1 and we expect that number will probably drift down about five in Q2 and then it will be really negligible to follow that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is from Edward Snyder with Charter Equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Edward Snyder</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all, you mentioned this to the inventory build on the quarter is that a specific product and was that in -- was it just a management of cash flow or are you looking for larger demand and how does that play out in the margin profile for the next couple of quarters? And then secondly on MIMO, you mentioned that you're in early stages of MIMO and that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re seeing in the industry. So, where do you see the boost here, is it primarily just higher ASP for your part or do you get some add-on components that they need to use when they are doing 2x2 or maybe eventually 3x3?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott McGregor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so on the inventory build, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we turned on a brand new ERP system, so what we did was we pre-build a lot of inventory and ordered some additional wafers under the preparation to make sure that if there are any issues with turning the system on, that we would be in a position where we could manually ship. Turns out that we\u2019ve turned the system on and its operating just fine. So the inventory build was principally just in anticipation and we had built ahead literally a week, week and a half of products while we made the transition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impacts to margin, there really is no impact for margin for us relative to what we\u2019re doing it's really sort of a products of -- now of just sort of mix and [filter].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Eric Brandt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On your connectivity question, I mean the MIMO parts generally have higher ASPs, they have more radios, they have more silicon as part of them. So it isn\u2019t so much the other components around them that we make the profit on and as of that way but rather the inherent ASP of the device itself and the opportunity often in the high-end phones that they\u2019re interested in other things such as NFC or other things we can include as part of the connectivity overall solution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Scott McGregor for final remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott McGregor</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks everyone for joining us today. Broadcom had a really solid start to 2015 and I think that\u2019s reflective of the strength of our core businesses and our focus on profitable growth. Looking forward, we\u2019re all excited about new products, new technologies and feature trends across all of our communication markets and we expect that this fuel growth for many years to come.
