All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. Please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up.</p> <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Susan Lisa, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Susan Lisa</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today\u2019s call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p> <p>We issued a press release earlier this morning, announcing our Q1 2021 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the relese. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today\u2019s call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials &amp; Filings.</p> <p>Duration of this morning's call will be approximately one hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q1 performance, as well as future<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q2 and fiscal year 2021 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q2 and fiscal 2021 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&amp;A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> and Dr. Ken Stein.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestures for which they are no comparable period net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, which closed March 1, 2020, and Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicine, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. Divestures include BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and the Intrauterine Health Franchise, which were divested in mid-August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively. Guidance excludes the recently announced Lumenis surgical acquisition and the BTG Specialty Pharmaceutical businesses, which as I mentioned, was divested as of March 1, 2021 one month earlier than originally anticipated. For more information, please refer to Slide 9 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which maybe found on our Investor Relations website.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified are organic. Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8%, excluding COVID, represent comparisons between time periods, in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of note, this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share; new product approvals and launches; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&amp;D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Mahoney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Susie, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to report a good start to 2021 with a return to growth versus both 20202020 and 20192019. Financial results had exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS and multiple significant clinical milestones and continued advancement of our category leadership strategy with new product launches and tuck-in M&amp;A, including Preventice in cardiac diagnostics and Lumenis, which is a leader in laser technology for kidney stones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total company first quarter operational sales grew 5.6% versus 2020. Organic sales grew 6% versus 2020 and 3% versus 2019, exceeding expectations as the second-half of the quarter came in stronger than anticipated, procedure recovery and market share gains across many of our businesses and regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Many of these gains were fueled by new and ongoing product launches, most notably our Ranger DCB, Eluvia DES, POLARx Catheter, LUX-Dx Implantable Cardiac Monitor and their Vercise Genus Deep Brain Stimulation platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 grew 33% versus 2020 and 5% versus 2019, which exceeds the high-end of guidance by $0.03, primarily due to higher sales performance and spend controls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted operating margin of 24.3% was in line with our expectations and demonstrated solid progress from 2020, and we\u2019re really pleased with our free cash flow generation of $213 million and adjusted free cash flow of $404 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe these better-than-expected results are indicative of our ability to regain our pre-pandemic six-year track record of excellent performance as we execute against our strategic plan, objectives and drive towards ex-COVID financial goals for 6% to 8% organic sales growth, continued operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and importantly, an improved ability to deploy our healthy free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re encouraged by the outlook of the rest of the year and we\u2019re emerging from the headwinds of the pandemic well-positioned, given our category leadership positions, innovative pipeline, commercial execution, enhanced digital capabilities and ongoing expansion into higher growth markets. And we look forward to highlighting these capabilities with you further at our Investor Day this year, which will be held on Wednesday, September 22.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So looking ahead, we continue to expect a steady recovery from the pandemic with less of an impact from COVID-19 in the second quarter versus first quarter and more normal procedure levels in second-half 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given the first quarter outperformance, we\u2019re narrowing the range for both full-year organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. So compared to 2020, we\u2019re targeting second quarter 2021 organic revenue growth of 44% to 48% and full-year, plus 15% to plus 18%. Compared to 2019, we\u2019re targeting second quarter organic revenue growth of 3% to 6% and for the full-year growth of 2% to 5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our second quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.36 to $0.38 and we\u2019re updating full-year adjusted EPS to a revised range of $1.53 to $1.60. Dan will also give the revenue contribution from Preventice and we continue to expect the second-half 2021 close for Lumenis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So now, I\u2019ll provide some additional highlights in first quarter 2021, along with some commentary on second quarter and the outlook. So regionally, in first quarter, on an operational basis versus 2020, the U.S. grew 9%, Asia-Pac grew 9%, Middle East, Africa grew 2%, and the emerging market sales grew 13%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Growth in the U.S. is supported by procedure recovery, particularly in March, along with new product launches across the entire portfolio. Europe, Middle East, Africa was driven by new product innovations with particular strength in PI, EP and Endo as the majority of markets grew in the first quarter versus first quarter 2019 even as some countries experienced lockdowns and related procedural impacts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Asia, every market grew in the first quarter versus first quarter 2020. And going forward, in Japan, despite COVID uncertainties, we expect full-year growth versus 2019, thanks to the diversified portfolio and new product launches such as Ranger DCB, STABLEPOINT, WATCHMAN FLX and LithoVue, which is expected later in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">China sales grew 20% versus 2020 and were flat versus 2019, which reflects the negative impact of tender pricing for drug-eluting stents and balloons. The rest of the China portfolio saw strong double-digit growth in first quarter versus 2019 with particularly notable momentum behind both Complex PCI and imaging products, as well as Endo, Uro and PI. We continue to expect full-year 2021 double-digit growth for China versus both 2020 and 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. Urology and Pelvic Health continue to expand market share and sales grew organically 9% versus 2020 and first quarter growth was balanced regionally with strengths in Stone and Prostate Health.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Product highlights include continued momentum with SpaceOAR Vue Hydrogel, which drove double-digit growth overall for the SpaceOAR business. Rez\u016bm also grew double digits, fueled in part by the publication of the compelling five-year results, demonstrating Rez\u016bm\u2019s durability with a low 4.4% reintervention rate for BPH patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And looking ahead, we\u2019re excited to continue to build out our Stone portfolio and extend our global footprint with the acquisition of the surgical business of Lumenis and its leading laser fiber technology. The deal is expected to close in the second-half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Endoscopy, sales grew organically 10% versus 2020 and Endo continues to grow market share globally with double-digit growth in all regions versus 2019, led by strength in key franchises such as pancreaticobiliary, hemostasis and infection prevention, and thanks to recent launches in our differentiated technologies such as SpyGlass DS, Discover and AXIOS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">EXALT D momentum is gradually improving as we have started to see capacity per hospitals to establish new protocols, hospital access has increased and the Medicare outpatient pass through payment. We also continue to target launch of our single-use bronchoscope in the second-half 2021 and remain bullish on the long-term opportunity for single-use scopes broadly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Cardiac Rhythm Management, sales were up 1% organically versus 2020 and we believe that our CRM performance was slightly below the overall market. For the full-year 2021, we forecast a slight tailwind from the replacement cycle and anticipate beginning enrollment mid-year in MODULAR ATP, which is our dual track clinical study for a standalone leadless pacemaker, as well as to provide pacing and anti-tachycardia pacing to EMBLEM S-ICD patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our LUX-Dx implantable cardiac monitor launch is gaining US share, given its high-quality ECG signals, arrhythmia algorithm performance and streamlined back-end monitoring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We closed the Preventice acquisition as of March 1st and are pleased with the Preventice portfolio, which grew mid-20% on a pro forma basis for the full quarter. And despite recent reimbursement challenges of one segment of testing, long term ECG, we expect plus-20% pro forma growth for Preventice in 2021, given its ability to offer all four testing modalities with Bradycardia in many \u2014 and excellent detection algorithms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re excited to have such a unique position in the field of cardiac diagnostics and the ability to offer all diagnostic modalities, including the ambulatory ECG, LUX-Dx, ICM and the HeartLogic detection alert for heart failure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Electrophysiology sales were up 8% versus 2020 and POLARx, which is our second-generation single-shot cryo catheter is off to a strong start in Europe and taking share, given its effectiveness and ease of use.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">STABLEPOINT, our force-sensing therapeutic catheter with DiresctSense is also enjoying a good start in both Japan and Europe and has begun enrollment in its US IDE trial called NEWTON-AF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 2% versus 2020 and the first quarter result is an improvement sequentially despite the challenges of higher rates of spinal cord stim patient cancellations in December that also seeped into January and February due to the COVID surge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As patient reticence waned in March, trends improved significantly and also by the ongoing launch of our next-gen WaveWriter Alpha SCS system. Alpha has driven excitement due to its FAST and Contour paresthesia-free waveforms with MRI compatibility, which is also supported by our Cognita software solutions that enhance the physicians\u2019 ability to identify, manage and maintain SCS patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In deep brain stimulation, our Vercise Genus platform expands our MRI capabilities in both the rechargeable and non-rechargeable segments with Bluetooth communication capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 7% versus 2020 and every structural heart franchise WATCHMAN, ACURATE neo2 and SENTINEL delivered strong growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The WATCHMAN franchise accelerated its recovery, growing over 30% versus 2020 with extremely positive physician feedback on FLX device performance and safety as supported by the PINNACLE FLX IDE study that was published in Circulation during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, we completed the conversion to a consignment-based model last quarter and accounts in the US are now over 90% converted to FLX. We\u2019ve also seen a step-up in implants per center per week versus pre-COVID levels as more physician planters adopt the FLX technology. And we continue to push for indication expansion as we enroll the CHAMPION study and target enrollment completion of the OPTION trial by the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In TAVR, our ACURATE neo2 launch continues to do quite well in Europe and we\u2019re pleased to announce that we\u2019ve expanded our risk indication and our, ACURATE neo2 IDE trial. The IDE trial now includes all risk categories including low-risk TAVR patients. We continue to target US approval for all risk indications and market entry in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, SENTINEL, which is our cerebral embolic protection device reached a milestone of treating 50,000 patients cumulatively and continues to enroll in its protected TAVR randomized trial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Coronary therapies grew low single digits versus 2020 with global strength in complex PCI and imaging. This helped to offset drug-eluting stent price weakness in the US and China, and we continue to launch new products for complex PCI and are on track to begin enrollment in the second quarter for the AGENT Drug Coated Balloon study, which is a first in the US for coronary in-stent restenosis. And we\u2019re pleased that AGENT has been designated a Breakthrough Device.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Peripheral Interventions delivered strong performance and continues to gain market share with organic sales up 8% versus first quarter 2020 and Interventional Oncology grew high single digits versus first quarter 2020, driven by the achievement of several important milestones for TheraSphere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These include the recent PMA approval in hepatic cellular carcinoma as the positive target study outcomes were featured as a late-breaker at the Society for Interventional Radiology. In addition, we were granted a Breakthrough Device designation for the study of TheraSphere in patients suffering from glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Performance in our venous franchise was led by mid-teens growth in EKOS versus 2020 and in arterial, drug-eluting technologies also had a strong quarter as growth accelerated sequentially, thanks to our category leadership strategy to offer both a differentiated DES and a DCB, as well as sectors\u2019 continuing recovery on multiple datasets proving the safety and effectiveness of these therapies. The Eluvia DES in-patient add-on payment and the ongoing US launch of our Ranger DCB are helping us to drive share gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d also like to highlight two important sustainability accomplishments this quarter. The first is the publication of our performance report and its detailed addendum referencing the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines and secondly placed in eighth on the Forbes list of America\u2019s Best Employers for diversity in 2021. We remain as committed as ever to global sustainable economic, environmental and social practices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And overall, we\u2019re pleased with our early performance for the year and optimistic on the outlook. We continue to drive towards ex-COVID financial goals of 6% to 8% organic growth, margin expansion, driving strong cash flow and double-digit adjusted EPS growth, while living our values with enduring commitment to sustainable business practices. Very grateful for our employees for their winning spirit and I\u2019ll turn things over to Dan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Daniel Brennan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $2.752 billion, represents 8.2% reported revenue growth and reflects a $67 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 5.6% in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sales from the Preventice acquisition, which closed March 1st, contributed 70 basis points, more than offset by the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and our Intrauterine Health Franchise, resulting in 5.9% organic revenue growth, above our guidance range of down 3% to up 3% versus 2020. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, organic growth was 3% above our guidance range of down 6% to flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This 3% growth excludes $15 million in 2019 sales of divested Intrauterine Health and embolic beads businesses, as well as $160 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of one month of Preventice, two months of Specialty Pharmaceuticals and a full quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines and Vertiflex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Top-line results drove Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, representing 33% growth versus 2020, 5% growth versus 2019 and exceeding our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.34.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 68.9%, slightly below our expectations, driven by inventory charges and lower sales within higher margin businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As expected, the COVID-driven negative manufacturing variances capitalized on the balance sheet in 2020 should be substantially recognized in the P&amp;L by the end of the second quarter, enabling higher gross margins in the second-half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, slightly above our expectations, driven by strong sales and spend control as SG&amp;A and R&amp;D remained slightly below historical levels as a percentage of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to below the line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $97 million in line with our expectations. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 5.9% on an adjusted basis and includes 240 basis points of benefit from discrete tax items within the quarter, as well as a 190 basis point benefit from stock compensation accounting, higher than previously expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $404 million and free cash flow was $213 million with $284 million from operating activities, less $71 million of net capital expenditures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our goal is to deliver adjusted free cash flow in line with 2020 despite increased working capital headwinds in inventory and accounts receivable as we return to more normalized volumes during the remainder of 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As of March 2021, we had cash on hand of $2 billion. Our top priority for capital deployment remains tuck-in M&amp;A. We have capacity to pursue additional business development opportunities, while continuing to remain active with our venture capital portfolio and consider opportunistic share repurchase. We ended Q1 with 1.431 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now, I\u2019ll walk through the guidance for the second quarter and full-year 2021. For the full-year, we expect 2021 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 17%, which includes an approximate net 100 basis point headwind from the divestiture of our Intrauterine Health Franchise and Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 15% to 18% versus 2020 and 2% to 5% versus 2019. For the organic comparison to 2019, full-year 2019 sales exclude $50 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health Franchise, as well as $81 million in Specialty Pharmaceutical sales and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $480 million in sales from recent acquisitions, including Vertiflex through May, BTG Interventional Medicines through mid-August and Preventice as of March, as well as $13 million of Specialty Pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Q2 2021, we expect operational revenue growth to be in a range of 42% to 46%, which includes an approximate net 200 basis point headwind from the divestiture of Specialty Pharmaceuticals, partially offset by the acquisition of Preventice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we expect organic revenue growth to be in a range of 44% to 48% versus 2020 and 3% to 6% growth versus 2019. For the organic comparison to 2019, 2019 sales exclude $15 million in sales of our embolic beads portfolio and Intrauterine Health Franchise and at the midpoint of guidance, 2021 sales exclude approximately $175 million in sales from the acquisitions of Vertiflex, BTG Interventional Medicines and Preventice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For adjusted operating margin, while we aim for sequential improvement, we expect Q2 to be similar to Q1 as we remain flexible with investment opportunities and given a strong Q1 performance. Our goal is to average 26% adjusted operating margin in the back half of the year, setting us up to exit 2021 at a higher level than full-year 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to forecast our full-year 2021 operational tax rate to be approximately 11% and now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 10% due to the Q1 discrete tax benefits and more stock compensation favorability than previously anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to expect adjusted below the line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million to $425 million for the year. We expect fully diluted weighted average share counts of approximately 1.435 billion shares for Q2, 2021 and 1.436 billion for full-year 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are now raising the low end of our full-year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $1.53 and maintaining the high end of $1.60, in line with our update to sales guidance as Q1 results have removed some uncertainty from our previously wider range. For the second quarter, adjusted EPS is expected to be in a range of $0.36 to $0.38.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1, 20 21 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q1 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Susie, who will moderate the Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Susan Lisa</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Dan. Andrew, let\u2019s open it up to questions for the next 30, 35 minutes or so. As Andrew mentioned, in order to enable us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Andrew, please go ahead.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, thank you. And good morning, and congrats on a good start to the year. First question I'd love to ask is, just on your 2021 revenue guidance. And I realize there's a lot of numbers flying around here. But to keep it simple, I think you said your organic sales growth in the first quarter of 2021, over the first quarter of 2019 was 3%, you expect an improvement on that same basis to 3% to 6% in Q2 and 2% to 5% for the full-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is that suggests, kind of very little incremental growth in the back half versus the first-half. So is that simply conservatism? Or is there something going on in the back half that we should be aware of?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Daniel Brennan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Bob. Good morning. I\u2019ll take that one. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything going on in the back half. I mean, we believe the guidance is appropriate. And I think you\u2019re correct. I mean, the best way to look at it is probably versus 2019 to eliminate the COVID impact in the base year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so the way I think of it is, you look at Q1 and that was 3%, right? You look at Q2, and at the midpoint, that\u2019s 4.5%. So that\u2019s a nice acceleration. You heard Mike talk about the recovery and we look for that recovery to continue in Q2. So the midpoint is that 4.5%. And then if you look at the full-year range of 2% to 5% and you take the high-end of 5%, that implies that we\u2019re north of 6% in both of Q3 and Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so that\u2019s a nice acceleration from where we would be in Q2 at the midpoint and also it\u2019s worth noting that the comps versus 2019 are 200 basis points higher in the second-half, so are our comps for 2019 were 6% and 6% in the first-half of Q1 and Q2. So obviously, an average of 6%, and then in the back half, they were 9% and 7% for an average of 8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if you look at the high-end of the 5% and you say that implies that we\u2019re north of 6%, that\u2019s in the range of that 6% to 8% that we always talk about ex-COVID for our expectations. So we feel like, as we look at the 2% to 5% full-year and then also the Q2 3% to 6%, we think it\u2019s appropriate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Super helpful. And then one quick question for Mike on just a geographic question. Mike, I was wondering if you could just comment really quickly on kind of what you\u2019re seeing in Europe and Japan from a COVID and surgical procedure recovery perspective?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Good morning, Bob. In Europe, overall, very pleased with the team\u2019s performance, grew 2% in the quarter versus 2020 and 3% versus 2019. That\u2019s really despite some of the lockdowns that you\u2019ve seen. So in some markets like the UK, the business has been stronger. The business has picked up in Germany. Some countries like Italy and Spain have been a bit softer. So we do anticipate those markets to get better as we expand over the second quarter, given improvements in vaccination like we\u2019ve seen in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I would say the COVID impact in Europe has been more choppy, given the slightly slower pace of vaccine rollout and some of the lockdown in some of the countries, but nevertheless, the team did deliver positive growth versus 2020 and 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in Japan, really is similar story. Vaccination rates are a bit lower there, but nevertheless, the team did grow versus 2019 at 1%, which is encouraging, and we expect that business to strengthen as the year moves on and that supported by a number of product launches in Japan, primarily the DCB and Eluvia, the STABLEPOINT platform, as well as some additional launches in Neurology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the U.S. was the strongest market overall, China performed very well and some choppiness in Europe with some of the lockdowns, but the team delivered nice growth there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Bob.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, great. And I\u2019ll add my congrats on a really strong first quarter here. I wanted to touch on - I know a lot of your procedures, something like two-thirds are outside of the hospital in the ASC setting and a lot of these are, as we learned last year, deferrable procedures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019d love to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the potential for a backlog of patients to come through later this year and into next year and how sizable an opportunity that might be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good morning, Robbie. It\u2019s a bit difficult to quantify. We obviously try to frame it with our guidance for second quarter, which we anticipate acceleration of our first quarter, just if you take the midpoint. And so that obviously implies improvement and the strengthening of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And overall, you saw our most susceptible businesses to COVID - all of them more susceptible, but the most sensitive were Urology and Neuromodulation. And we saw quite a bit of softness in the first-half of the quarter really through most of February, particularly in SCS. And then we saw a significant improvement in March.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, we\u2019re quite bullish on that business is in the U.S. where the bulk of that business is in the U.S. in SCS in second quarter and second-half. And so we think that will be quite a bit stronger than it was in 2019 and stronger than it was in the first-half - first quarter. In Urology, you saw that Urology numbers were quite strong in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think to answer your question is a bit difficult. With the COVID improvement, we anticipate continued momentum based on the guidance that we gave, but it\u2019s difficult to predict additional bullishness on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Yes. I imagine it\u2019s tough for everyone to guess how it will play out. Maybe a quick follow-up on structural heart. Two things here. One, you had again really, really strong WATCHMAN FLX numbers and I saw in the slides, you mentioned that the ACURATE neo2 trial is now going after all risk patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So just thinking about the outlook for structural heart here, and any color you could give us on how you see 2021 playing out and how the updated trial protocol might help you down the road? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. WATCHMAN is doing excellent. We - in the script there, we talked about, we\u2019ve had over 90% conversion already to FLX. You\u2019re seeing same-center utilization increase, which is probably the most important metric, given the safety profile and the effectiveness of the device and the enthusiasm of electrophysiologists and cardiologists to implant it and the growing acceptance of this from the referring physician community.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So a lot of momentum behind WATCHMAN and we think the consignment move with FLX was a smart move for us. So that\u2019s all good news. And Dr. Meredith can kind of maybe comment a little bit on the ACURATE neo2 IDE trial, if you\u2019d like.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robbie. I guess the extension of the trial, the FDA approval this week of the extension of the trial to all risk patient categories, extreme, high, intermediate and now low risk is certainly a significant step forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will have to increase the number of patients, but we don\u2019t expect the timeline for the trial to actually change. But, come approval, to have the approval for all patient risks was - that certainly increase the opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Robbie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the really nice quarter here. One on the recovery, one on WATCHMAN. When you reported Q4 results, I think January was still declining year-over-year, February didn\u2019t seem like it was a great month with the weather and all. So it looks like you must have seen a pretty significant acceleration in March.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you talk about the trends through the quarter and what are you seeing in April? Apologies for the short-term question, but obviously, a lot of interest in that. And I have one follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Daniel Brennan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, I can take that one, Larry. Yes, I think it\u2019s probably pretty consistent with what you\u2019ve heard from other companies that are in our sector. January looked a lot like December, right? A lot of COVID impact globally and then February was a bit of a tale of two halves. So the first-half was weaker, the second-half we saw some recovery both from the anticipation of the weather, some increased vaccination rates and just the strength of the overall procedure volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then March continue to recover beyond that, so largely in line with what others have said and I think what you would probably expect. I\u2019m not going to get into specifics on April. But I think you heard Mike comment that our guidance includes continued recovery in Q2 and then into the second-half. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ll say on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s very helpful. And then on WATCHMAN, nice acceleration here to 30%, 34% growth over about 18% in Q4. Just looking ahead, just wanted to give you guys an opportunity to comment on new competition in the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two things, one, the street\u2019s, kind of, the consensus is about 30% share for them to take and my question is, can you still grow WATCHMAN in 2022 with new competition? Any high-level thoughts on those type of metrics, if you\u2019re willing to comment, would be helpful. Thank you for taking the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Our expectation is that will grow in 2022, the WATCHMAN business. It has a lot of momentum now, a lot of acceptance of the FLX device. And as I\u2019ve mentioned, utilization\u2019s growing. We\u2019ve got a number of clinical trials that are also in process and we also have a robust pipeline for WATCHMAN in the future. So there is more to come from WATCHMAN behind FLX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also just the therapies, as you know, it\u2019s so early. The awareness for the referring physicians, whether it\u2019d be cardiologist, GI doctors, neurologists continues to expand. They\u2019re seeing great outcomes for their patients. So I think the acceptance level of WATCHMAN continues to grow and the market opportunity - it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar market in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we think the market will continue to grow very, very healthy and these positive outcomes are driving more and more momentum. So our expectation is certainly to grow in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Congrats on the nice sprint here. Mike, maybe, one on cardio. I think there\u2019s been some noise around S-ICD recall, but in the context of your commentary around LUX ICM share gains and EP perhaps coming in slightly better, are the positives more than enough to offset, I guess, some of the CRM headwinds?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Dr. Stein will comment a little bit on S-ICD in a minute. I think you really captured the full portfolio picture here. And so we did see a little bit of softness in CRM in the quarter. We think we may have lost a little bit of share. And sequential quarter-over-quarter growth versus 2020, it\u2019s very minimal share loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it\u2019s typically - it\u2019s been common in the leadless pacemaker market where we - although the share loss, I would say, has reduced to more stabilized, as we think that segment is approaching full penetration in terms of that - the single chamber.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So although we lost share there, I would say that element\u2019s declining and we had a little bit of softness in defib with the S-ICD actions, but that business is beginning to rebound and Dr. Stein can comment on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, as you said, our full diagnostic portfolio with Preventice and LUX and the acceptance of LUX will be a nice tailwind for us in 2021 and 2022. And our EP business was quite strong in Europe, softer in the US, where we don\u2019t have some of these product approvals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So net-net, as you said, the diagnostics business will help offset some of the softness in CRM. And EP, in Europe and Japan in particular, will offset some of the U.S. So those are certainly additive and beneficial to the CRM growth profile. And maybe, Dr. Stein, if you want to comment on S-ICD. It looks like Dr. Stein is not available.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kenneth Stein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. Let me come off mute, sorry. Yes, thanks, Mike. And Vijay, as Mike said, we did have a softer quarter with S-ICD related to the advisories. We fully expect that to recover. And I think the message is penetrated to physicians that the overall performance of the S-ICD system and the S-ICD lead in particular is that at least it\u2019s good as the best transient S leads on the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Having said that, we do have an enhanced lead in development that should help resolve any residual concerns. And very excited, as Mike said in his prepared remarks, to beginning our EMPOWER trial, which is trial of a leadless pacemaker designed to work in concert with the S-ICD and thereby preserving all of the unique benefits of the S-ICD in terms of the reduced procedure complications, reduced risk of infection, while bringing the capability to provide an anti-tachycardia pacing and bradycardia pacing reliably to patients who need it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And then Dan, one quick guidance question for you. I think the updated EPS guidance - one, just remind us, that does not include Lumenis, correct? I think we were expecting a couple of hundred million of revenues and some EPS accretion. And gross margin step-up second-half - what was the impact from manufacturing variances in Q1 and any sense on what the step-up should be in back half? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Daniel Brennan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So the Lumenis acquisition is excluded from guidance, that has not closed. So you are correct that\u2019s excluded. And the way - we obviously think of operating margin at the bottom line with all the individual components of gross margin and SG&amp;A and R&amp;D. But specific to gross margin, we wanted to be approaching 70% in Q1, we ended up, as I said, slightly short of that because of inventory charges and some lower sales in some of the higher margin businesses. Obviously, you look at neuromod, has one of the best gross margins of our businesses and that was the most impacted by COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So confident that as we go into Q2, we\u2019ll get back to that approaching 70%. And then as you get into the second-half, we\u2019re not going to get back to the 2019 levels of 72.4%, but we should see improvement, partially because the COVID inefficiencies and some of the things that are specific to COVID should start to dissipate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But also that\u2019s normally what happens in a year where we have the first-half margins, from a gross margin perspective, are always lower than the second-half, because we have the inventory revaluation that happens in the first-half. And if you look back over the last four, five years, second-half gross margin is always better than the first-half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we believe that trend will continue. So if you think of second quarter approaching 70% and then better than that in the second-half and that gets back to the overall adjusted operating margin commentary that says we want to get back to averaging 26% in the back half of 2021, which is in line with the overall full-year 2019 levels, which should set us up well for 2022 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful, thanks, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Daniel Brennan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thanks, Vijay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Kaila Krum with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kaila Krum</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. So, first, would love to just hear how the Preventice integration is going and how or if your strategy with that business has changed at all just given the reimbursement updates in the extended-wear ECG markets a few weeks back. Just to be curious, will you still be able to service all categories of patients or do you plan to, and any thoughts on that would be super helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Yes, we\u2019re quite pleased with that. That closed, I guess, on March 10, right? And I just met with the team last week in Minnesota. So, the business performed quite well in the first quarter and we\u2019re quite bullish on that business going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ve heard the strategy before. We think we\u2019re differentiated, we\u2019re the only company that can offer the full range of diagnostic modalities, four different ones within the Preventice portfolio. And they combine that with the ICM business that we have in HeartLogic and our ICDs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we think that provides a differentiated suite of diagnostic tools for physicians and the beauty of the Preventice platform is they are able to toggle between different diagnostic modalities within the same device. And so they have quite sophisticated algorithms that can all be done remotely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so although there is some pressure, as you mentioned, in the extended Holter in terms of reimbursements, the other parts of that business continue to grow and due to the inherent flexibility of the platform, we\u2019re able to modulate patients into this different modalities, depending on what the patient need maybe or maybe the reimbursement circumstance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think that capability provides us a lot of flexibility and you tie it together with our LUX Loop Recorder, which is doing quite well, it gives us a strong portfolio. So we\u2019re very bullish on the business and excited for the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kaila Krum</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And then just, I mean, with Preventice locked in and Lumenis expected to close in the second part of this year, how should we think about just appetite for M&amp;A going forward? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Daniel Brennan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the good news is, as I said, we have $2 billion of cash on the balance sheet today and our number one priority remains high quality, high growth tuck-in M&amp;A. Really pleased with the Preventice and Lumenis acquisitions. Obviously, Preventice having closed, Lumenis closing hopefully later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have the appetite and we have the balance sheet in place to continue to do that. And that feels like maybe one or two more of those tuck-in acquisitions that we could get done here in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kaila Krum</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Daniel Brennan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Cecilia Furlong with Morgan Stanley.

I guess I wanted to start off with the EP business, your comments around POLARx, but really what you\u2019re seeing early days of adoption of POLARx in Europe, as well as just overall portfolio performance today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dr. Stein, you want to take that one, if you heard it, on POLARx in Europe?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kenneth Stein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I am happy to take that one. We are very pleased with the commercial uptake of POLARx in Europe to date. Again, likewise on track right now with our IDE clinical trial in the United States, which is called FROZEN-AF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s been interesting launching a new product into a pandemic, but in spite of everything with COVID, I think it\u2019s become clear to physicians using it that there are really quite a few competitive advantages this has versus the first generation cryo system that\u2019s out there. And we\u2019re pleased with the safety results and we\u2019re very pleased with the efficacy and ease of use that we\u2019re seeing in Europe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cecilia Furlong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great.

Thanks, Mike. Yes, thanks for the question. SENTINEL continues to do well. We are operating in more than 800 accounts - over 800 accounts worldwide. The protected TAVR trial is recruiting very well despite COVID, and as you know, that\u2019s a 3,000 patient definitive randomized trial against standard of care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we feel that the results of that trial should provide good evidence for long-term use in standard of care for cerebral embolic protection. So the trial is recruiting very well at present.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There was a question on the Millipede early feasibility trial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So the Millipede - thank you. The Millipede early feasibility study is underway. We received FDA approval to - for the EFS study for the US.

Good morning, Dan. One big picture question and then a product question. When I look at the regions, the organic growth, obviously US, Asia-Pac, emerging markets strong. EMEA, clearly the laggard, that\u2019s not shocking or surprising, but how are you thinking about the recovery in those regions? And what do you - how are you thinking about it in offering up your guidance now? Second-half recovery or it takes a year? Any incremental thoughts there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would say, just maybe a couple of other insights there. Our Middle East North Africa business, which historically had been not prioritized enough in terms of capabilities, we really invested in that business, Eric Thepaut and the team, the past few years. And you\u2019re seeing that business begin to scale up and that actually did quite well in the first quarter. So we expect continued momentum from that Mid-East North Africa region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But in more of the general European business, we do expect improvement in that business throughout 2021. It had softer business, as Dan mentioned, more broadly in January, February. Some countries are more normalized -not quite normal but more normalized based on vaccine rates and some, as you know, Italy and others have been more on lockdown. But we do anticipate those regions strengthening throughout the year. So overall, I\u2019m quite bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at that European business versus our peers that we\u2019ve done quite well in terms of share taking in most of our businesses and despite the lockdowns, they did put up positive growth in the quarter and we do anticipate that improving throughout 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And on the product front, Mike, you mentioned that EXALT-D momentum is, I think your words were, gradually improving. Maybe you can help us understand a little more. At the end of March, we spoke to nine or 10 gastroenterologists, they all highlighted their strong interest, but also indicated that there - they had questions about reimbursements, first-gen technological limitations, the lack - understandable lack of early clinical data. Just how should we think about those concerns? How are you addressing them and where from here with EXALT-D? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So this is a long-term investment for us. As you know, it started off with LithoVue and SpyGlass that had some similar commentary to EXALT-D and I had added similar commentary, three, four years ago, if you recall. And so we\u2019re quite committed to this segment. We\u2019ve seen the benefit of LithoVue and SpyGlass and we expect similar results over time with EXALT-D.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re really just kind of chunking these out and making enhancements all the time. You\u2019ve seen improved reimbursement in the outpatient setting. There\u2019s been some news recently, just last night, on the NTAP for EXALT-D that just happened - I think it was just published yesterday or early this morning, which will help with the reimbursement in the in-patient center. So you\u2019re seeing stronger improved reimbursement capabilities in general for the EXALT-D with the GPT and now the NTAP, which is exciting news.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on the device itself, it\u2019s a 510(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/K\" title=\"Kellanova\">K</a>) device. And so with that, the team will continue to make enhancements to that platform like we\u2019ve done with LithoVue and Spy too. So you\u2019ll see some additional enhancements to the product in the second-half of 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the other piece, as you mentioned, is impacted by COVID and so now we are seeing some improvement in there, we\u2019re placing more capital and you\u2019re seeing some of the stronger uptake in March that we had earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we\u2019re bullish on it. It\u2019s not going to be a - we expect a steady improvement and a steady growth cadence of this rather than a hockey stick. But the improved reimbursement, COVID subsiding over time, will certainly help the dynamics of this business and throughout 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s great, thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.

Thank you. That will come from Josh Jennings with Cowen. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Jennings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a follow-up on the Millipede question. Just wanted to see if Mike or Dr. Meredith would be willing to just give us an update on your views of the transcatheter mitral opportunity. Just the market, do you believe it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar opportunity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then any updates on process and strategy we may hear more in the September Investor Day? But Millipede here, any other internal investments or development programs are there in place [ph]? And then just, what is the strategy from here to get involved in the mitral space - transcatheter mitral space?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks very much for the question. First, the mitral valve disease, particularly mitral regurgitation, it\u2019s at least three times more prevalent than IOX [ph] stenosis. And with an aging population and increasing burden of heart failure and heart failure being a driver to mitral regurgitation this is a huge global opportunity, and indeed a multi-billion dollar opportunity. So I think the prevalence and the global tomography really point to this being a significant opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The mitral valve and the aortic valve are very different. The mitral valve, as you well know, is a complex structure. So there is no one single device that will actually serve to treat mitral valve disease. As we often say, the only similarity between the aortic and the mitral valve is the word valve. The rest is completely different. So mitral requires a toolbox approach, if you like, in order to treat that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the foundation, though, the most important foundation for treating mitral valve disease, particularly functional mitral regurgitation, is an annuloplasty device and that\u2019s why we have focused on a trans - venous transseptal module annuloplasty device. This is a permissive technology that allows you to add in whatever other appropriate strategy is needed to tailor the solution for the mitral valve disease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have a thoughtful strategy as to how we can build out the toolbox approach in order to effectively trade what is the largest single valve condition on the planet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Susan Lisa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One final question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And that will come from Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Danielle Antalffy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong start to the year. I just have one high level question and it\u2019s around, you\u2019ve heard a lot of your large competitors talk about COVID sort of putting them in a stronger competitive position than they were pre-COVID. And I suspect some of that has to do with sort of stronger relationships with their hospital customers, purchasing or breadth across the portfolio and R&amp;D productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, I\u2019d be curious to hear about how you think Boston\u2019s competitive positioning has changed with some of the shifting trends as it relates to COVID, if it\u2019s changed at all? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Mahoney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Pre-COVID, I\u2019ve commented in the script, we had grown faster than most of our peers, not all of them, but most of them for about six to eight years and obviously our portfolio was hit by COVID. So now that the - it\u2019s waning, we anticipate we\u2019ll get back to that above peer group\u2019s growth. Supported by our strong positions in many of our markets in this quarter, we gained share in many segments, not everyone, but most of our segments, we gained share and our pipeline is - of launches from - it really left over from 2020 on which our team did a nice job, which we can launch in 2021 and beyond and future pipeline is quite strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the other thing, like many companies, we\u2019ve really beefed up our digital capabilities over the past 12 months. That\u2019s been a benefit of COVID, everything from physician training to proctoring to our internal training and efficiencies that we have there. So we\u2019ve made pretty significant investment in our - all things digital over the past 12 months, which will serve us well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019ve seen also the continuing - besides the - our expectation to grow faster than peers supported by the pipeline, ongoing adjacent markets that we\u2019re moving into, they\u2019re faster growing. You saw great results out of TheraSphere in the Y-90 and the BTG acquisition overall. And they\u2019re very consistent results there and now recently supported new acquisitions with Preventice and Lumenis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, our core business, not every single business, but the majority of our businesses, we are quite confident, will grow faster than the peer group and faster and gain share and we continue to expand into faster growth markets and also expand our capabilities in China and Middle East North Africa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Danielle Antalffy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This concludes our question-and-answer session.
