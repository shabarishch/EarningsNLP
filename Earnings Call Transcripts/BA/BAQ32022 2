Welcome to everybody. Thanks for joining us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I will acknowledge upfront that our plans for the investor conference middle of next week we\u2019re looking forward to them. We hope we can give some guideposts for the forward look in The Boeing Company. So, many of our comments today will be<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> a little shorter than usual and focused strictly on the quarter.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter was a big one for us. We hit a marker, a marker we\u2019ve set since the beginning of our turnaround effort in the beginning of 2020, and that was to generate positive free cash flow. So, we generated $2.9 billion in the quarter. That puts us on the path that we projected for 2022, which was positive. So again, a very important accomplishment for us and I think begins the real turning point for the Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the same time, we took a charge on our fixed-price development contracts. These are contracts that we have talked about now repeatedly on these calls. We believe, as we always do, that the charge that we took is meant to complete these contracts ultimately to deliver them to satisfied customers in the Air Force or the armed forces. And anyway, we\u2019re not embarrassed by them. They are what they are, and we intend to deliver against these contracts and satisfy our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Without a doubt, and you\u2019ve heard it from all of the earnings calls over the course of the week, the supply chain, inflation, labor shortages, macroeconomic challenges are challenging for everybody. That is reflected in these third quarter calls, Again, the charges in our fixed price development world, et cetera, all of that\u2019s embedded. We\u2019re not anticipating or suggesting that the supply chain world is going to get much better in the near term. We expect it will continue to be challenged over the course of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of our problems is not demand. Demand is very strong. It\u2019s strong across the portfolio of products, and it\u2019s strong across the world with all of our customers. Why? Because their demand is strong. Bookings in pretty much every geography is strong with the exception of China. But also there are concerns about the very supply constraints that we\u2019re all referring to, sort of force them to want to get in line and get their orders in so that they have the lift they need as the world returns to some normal state.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What\u2019s our job in this supply-constrained world? Well we\u2019re in the factories. We don\u2019t push the system too fast. We slow down when we have to and we try not to compound problems that may arise from the supply chain or from our own shops. We\u2019ve added more than 10,000 people this year, and we are investing in training and development to accelerate their experience curve and improve our productivity over time. And we\u2019re driving stability in the supply chain. We\u2019ve introduced all kinds of on-site technology, digital tools to watch what they\u2019re doing, but also we\u2019ve added people to those organizations that are more challenged than others. And we\u2019ve increased inventory, safety stock wherever we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Truth is it will still take time to normalize. And our objective in the investor conference that lies ahead is to give you that projection as to how and when we think that is likely to happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the challenges, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress broadly. Our 87 deliveries have returned. It\u2019s a reflection on us focusing on the right things. Strict conformance with respect to our manufacturing processes is very important. We\u2019ve gotten it right, and the delivery process has started, and so far, so good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 737 MAX, return to service, again, philosophy is one at a time. 1 million revenue flights, exceptional schedule reliability, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced. And that is why the folks who have leaned into the MAX continue to lean into the MAX and continue to place orders with us. In total, over the quarter, 227 orders for airplanes, WestJet, UPS, Cargolux, China Airlines, just a few, again, very strong. You probably have seen today, Alaska has upped their commitment to the MAX, and we greatly appreciate it from all of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In a strong demand and yet supply-constrained world, our inventory, the fixed -- finished goods inventory that we have is an asset, not a liability, and we use it to de-risk that delivery outlook. And as for China, we continue to derisk. That\u2019s been our objective. We still would like to deliver airplanes to China. We continue to support our customers. We continue to support the regulator. As we all know, the COVID restrictions and policies in China have reduced demand for airplanes in general. And we hope that is what is restricting the acceptance of our -- of the airplanes that they have on our tarmacs. But we also are clear eyed about the geopolitical risks that are out there, and we are not going to impart new risks on our investors, and we believe we can derisk what we have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re progressing on our development programs, the -7, the -10, the 777-9 and the -8 freighter. All of these are progressing well. As everybody knows, we are up against a deadline here at the end of the year. We remain confident that we can get an extension of that deadline because this is the safe answer. And we\u2019ve heard from airlines, we\u2019ve heard from pilots, we\u2019ve heard from our workers, associates, and we know that the FAA has been putting in the work to certify these airplanes. So, we remain not just hopeful but confident that we can get this across the finish line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then those airplanes, as many of you know, complete that narrow-body portfolio in a way that allows us to compete head-to-head with our important competitor, Airbus. BDS, Boeing Defense, yes, we have these fixed price development challenges. But we have a rich portfolio. We delivered 4 MH-139 Grey Wolf test aircraft to the U.S. Air Force. We received contracts for additional KC-46A tankers for both the U.S. Air Force and the Israeli Air Force. And despite the challenges on our real development programs that the tanker T-7 and MQ-25, we still remain confident in our long-term success and contribution to our cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Boeing Services, BGS, just another very strong quarter. They\u2019re trying to keep up with demand the best they can. They delivered their 100th contracted 737-800 Boeing freighter conversion to AerCap. We\u2019ve got key awards in both commercial and defense customers and things are going well, and margins continue to expand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then finally, we have not stopped investing in our foundational capabilities. We had some pretty good examples of that over the course of the quarter. We opened three advanced facilities across the country, composite fabrication, additive manufacturing and an important autonomy investment alongside MIT just in Cambridge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also very excited about Wisk\u2019s unveiling of the world\u2019s first autonomous self-flying 4-seat all electric vertical takeoff and landing air taxi. There\u2019s a very bright future ahead for that. And with respect to autonomy and its advancement in the world of certification, it\u2019s a very, very important part of our strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we\u2019re making great progress. I feel good about our turnaround. I do think the cash flow numbers in the quarter are, in fact, a marker for us. We\u2019ve been focused on it. We will continue to manage the Company on the basis of the cash economics that we support our investors with. And that\u2019ll be that. So, I\u2019m happy to turn it over to Brian now for some color on the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brian West</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s jump right in. Cash flow, as Dave mentioned is our primary financial metric and it was positive in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $3.2 billion and free cash flow was $2.9 billion, both up pretty significantly versus both prior year and prior quarter, essentially driven by higher deliveries and some receipt timing. Revenue, earnings both impacted by charges in our defense business, where we took a $2.8 billion hit across five fixed price development programs, which I\u2019ll go into.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The macro environment challenges that Dave described required us to make certain adjustments, including a reassessment of future period cost forecasts. These adjustments are important to our go-forward momentum as we de-risk our defense portfolio and move to more predictable performance. And we still think about our performance in three parts and are positioning ourselves for an improving trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, we have reached important milestones across the business and made progress on commercial deliveries with the resumption of the 787 in August. Also, the 737 MAX return to service is largely complete, and we\u2019re derisking the near-term delivery skyline for China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we started to see improvement in our primary financial metric of free cash flow. This third quarter performance puts us on track to be positive for both the second half and the full year of 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, as we look to 2023, our operational and financial performance should continue to improve. Now, the acceleration will not be as significant as previously anticipated, and our path to recovery is taking a bit longer than expected driven by the challenging macro environment. Longer term, there is a significant opportunity for our company to return to sustainable growth. As we liquidate the 37 and the 87 inventory, we improve execution on a de-risked BDS portfolio and achieve certification on the MAX, -7, the -10 and the 777X development programs. We look forward to sharing our plans at our investor conference next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before getting into the financials, I want to make a few points on the current business environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 3. While the turnaround is taking a bit longer, one thing that remains strong is demand for airplanes, as the commercial market recovery is playing out better than expected. We still see overall passenger traffic returning to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 time frame. And although the economic indicators point to challenges ahead, this demand has proven resilient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In August, domestic traffic was at 85% of 2019 levels, led by the U.S., Europe and Latin America. Going forward, the recovery will be driven by China domestic and international traffic, which remain below 2019 levels at 62% and 67%, respectively. In aggregate, commercial passenger traffic was at 74% of 2019 levels. So, even with economic headwinds, we see the strength of demand continuing as air traffic recovers to its historic levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Defense and Space, we see solid long-term markets, both domestically and internationally. In the U.S., there\u2019s broad support for increased defense spending in Congress to meet current challenges. And internationally, ongoing global tensions are driving our partners and our allies to announce plans for increased spending and additional capabilities for national defense, and we\u2019re working hard to support their needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In services, our business is well positioned with a broad set of offerings and will continue to benefit from the growing commercial fleet, a robust cargo market and increasing defense budgets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the supply chain. Constraints continue to impact production in both our commercial and defense businesses. On the commercial side, we\u2019re focused on a few key areas, namely engine deliveries, which is the primary constraint to 737 production rate stabilization and subsequent increases. Customers are counting on us to resolve the situation with our supply chain partners, and we will. We\u2019re taking actions to mitigate these impacts and support the supply chain. And as Dave described, we\u2019ve increased our on-site presence at first tier and sub-tier suppliers to support work movement and address industry-wide shortages. And we\u2019re utilizing our own internal fabrication for surge capacity and managing safety stock inventory levels and increasing where necessary to protect risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With overall healthy demand, finished goods inventory and a diverse backlog, we feel well positioned to navigate the current environment and are confident that our product lineup is well suited to meet our customer needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that backdrop, let\u2019s turn to the financials on slide 4. Third quarter revenue of $16 billion increased 4%. Core operating earnings were negative $3.1 billion, resulting in a loss per share of $6.18, largely driven by $2.8 billion of defense charges. We generated $3.2 billion of operating cash flow, a significant improvement from the same period last year, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries and favorable receipt timing. Also, similar to the same period last year, we benefited from a tax refund of $1.5 billion in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s move to Commercial Airplanes on slide 5. Third quarter revenue was $6.3 billion, up 40% primarily driven by the resumption of the 787 and higher 737 deliveries. Operating losses of $0.6 billion and the resulting negative margin rate reflect abnormal costs and period expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 87 program, we delivered 9 airplanes in the quarter and have 115 airplanes in inventory. The pace of deliveries from inventory going forward will be based on finishing rework as well as customer fleet planning requirements. We expect most of these airplanes to be delivered over the next two years. We continue to produce at low rate and will gradually return to five airplanes per month over time. Near term, the supply chain remains a key watch item for 87 production and deliveries. Longer term, with more than 400 airplanes in backlog, we anticipate higher production rates due to the expected wide-body market recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As customers return to medium-term fleet planning, we continue to have positive discussions with our customers on the 87. We recorded $330 million of 87 abnormal costs in the quarter, in line with expectations, and we still anticipate a total of about $2 billion, the most be incurred by the end of 2023. These costs are driven by rework and production rates below five per month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to the 37 program. We delivered 88 airplanes in the quarter, below our previous expectations, primarily due to supply chain disruptions, which impacted factory flow time. We continue to work towards stabilizing deliveries. However, given our delivery to date, we now estimate about 375 737 airplanes this year. The monthly delivery trend is expected to remain in the low-30s into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the quarter with 270 MAX airplanes in inventory, down 20 versus last quarter. There were 35 deliveries out of storage, largely in line with our plan, but we also began positioning for MAX 7 deliveries and built 13 airplanes in the quarter. Of the inventoried airplanes, 138 are for customers in China. We continue to explore options to remarket some of these airplanes as we derisk our near-term delivery plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on our latest assessment of China and the -7, -10 certification time lines, we now expect most of the inventoried airplanes to deliver in 2023 and 2024 with some moving into 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to the 777-9 program. Development efforts are ongoing and the program time line is unchanged from what we shared last quarter. We still anticipate delivery of the first 777-9 airplane in 2025 and continue to coordinate with the FAA to prioritize resources across our development programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We booked $111 million of 777X abnormal costs in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, and we still expect to record about $1.5 billion of these costs through 2023, while 777-9 production remains paused.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we booked 227 commercial airplane orders. As Dave mentioned, the customers we are proud to serve. In September alone, we received orders for each of our programs, including the 737 MAX, the 767, 787, 777, 777X. And at the end of the third quarter, we had over 4,300 airplanes in backlog valued at $307 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now move to Defense, Space and Security on slide 6. Third quarter revenue was $5.3 billion, down 20%, and operating margin was negative 52.7%. Results were driven by approximately $2.8 billion of losses on certain fixed price development programs. KC-46A and VC-25B made up the bulk of these charges at $1.2 billion and $766 million, respectively. We also recorded losses on T-7A, MQ-25 and commercial crude programs and saw pressures across other programs. These losses reflect a comprehensive review of program financial estimates. While some changes resulted from new information or developments during the quarter, others were the result of our most recent assessment of estimated future performance. Adjustments were primarily due to higher estimated manufacturing and supply chain costs as well as technical challenges, which are expected to continue longer than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The cash impact of the losses we recorded year-to-date are now heavily weighted in the near term, resulting in a cash flow usage at BDS for both 2022 and 2023. While current performance doesn\u2019t reflect where we\u2019d like to be, for sure, we\u2019re focused on driving execution stability. These programs have an outsized impact on BDS margins and will be key to margin recovery in future periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the demand side, we received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including tanker awards from both, the U.S. and Israel, resulting in BDS backlog of $55 billion. Additionally, the Apache helicopter has been selected by the Polish military.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s turn to Global Services results on slide 7. The Global Services business had another strong quarter, primarily driven by our parts and distribution business. Third quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, up 5%, and operating margin was 16.5%. Results were driven by higher commercial volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower government volume. We received $5 billion in orders during the quarter, including a tanker support contract for the Italian Air Force and an F/A-18 depot expansion contract. The BGS backlog is $19 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With highly valued commercial capabilities and support for our defense portfolio, our service business is positioned to see continued growth. Based on what we\u2019ve seen so far this year, we anticipate healthy total services top line growth for 2022 and similar growth in 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 8 and cover cash and debt. We ended the third quarter with strong liquidity with $14.3 billion of cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet, an improvement of $2.9 billion since the end of the second quarter driven by free, cash flow generation. During the quarter, due to our improving cash flow and business outlook, we chose to reduce the size of our revolving credit facility capacity from $14.7 billion to $12 billion, which remains undrawn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year-to-date operating cash flow was a generation of $55 million, and free cash flow usage year-to-date was $841 million. We expect our primary financial metric, free cash flow, to be positive for the fourth quarter and the full year, driven by commercial deliveries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our debt balance is consistent with the end of the last quarter at $57.2 billion. Our investment-grade credit rating is a priority, and we remain committed to reducing debt levels through strong cash flow generation over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In conclusion, while we have more work to do, we\u2019re executing on our turnaround, and we\u2019ve come quite a long way over the last three years. We remain focused on our own performance and taking the right actions to drive stability and growth for the future. We also continue to invest in key capabilities that will lay the foundation for the future. And through it all, our team is demonstrating exceptional resilience and dedication. More work ahead, but we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on the right path.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, over to Dave for closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dave Calhoun</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I\u2019ll keep it short and sweet. We\u2019re on a turnaround. We\u2019ve been on a turnaround. We\u2019ve made very important progress with our regulators. We\u2019ve made very important progress with our customers and even more importantly, the flying public. And now, we\u2019re wrestling through supply chain constraints. And when we get through it all, we\u2019ll get back to normal and ultimately deliver what our shareholders are expecting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I\u2019ll leave it at that and open up to questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sheila Kahyaoglu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Dave and Brian. You started the call with comments around the supply chain challenges that you\u2019re seeing, and you talked about it lasting through 2023. And it doesn\u2019t seem inventory is the issue, and it\u2019s mostly engine. So, what sort of steps is the team taking to work with suppliers to resolve these risks? And how do you expect it to impact the output and, ultimately, deliveries? I think you mentioned low-30s through next year on the Max. Historically, you\u2019ve said 8 to 10 out of inventory. So, how do we think about the production pipeline there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that -- let me start with steps. So, I\u2019ll let Brian maybe quantify best he can. But I -- the steps are they\u2019re as clear as they can be. We\u2019ve been talking about this for quite a while. We get on regular calls with our counterparts at the engine suppliers. And as you know, in our case, it\u2019s predominantly CFM and then GE broadly across the wide-body fleet, et cetera. So, we literally go down through all of those schedules. It inevitably comes down to castings and the support that they get from the two big casting suppliers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the best thing I can say now is that we are clearly on the same page, ourselves and our suppliers. We are taking steps to increase at a very gradual and, I hope, a disciplined way, the increase in rate with respect to castings and then ultimately from engines to us. I don\u2019t want to predict outcomes on that front. I think the most important thing is we\u2019re not being surprised as frequently as we used to be, and I do think that the engine suppliers are getting their heads -- their arms around things in a much better way than they had previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s really the situation as it is. I am confident that the industry will step up, but it will take more time than I probably had hoped when we started these conversations. And I suspect it won\u2019t be until we get to the sort of end of next year before we can really make sizable rate increases with respect to that constraint. Brian?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what I would say is that my comment on being in the low-30s, year-to-date, we\u2019ve been in the low-30s. And as we turn the quarter into next year, that all of a sudden is going to snap up to a 40 type number. So, it\u2019s going into the year. We\u2019re going to be constrained, as Dave mentioned, largely by the engines, and will be that low-30s. But as we get through next year, that rate will go up. And we\u2019ll talk a lot more about that next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we go to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m wondering on the defense charge. Obviously, we\u2019ve gone through a number of these, but they sort of keep growing in magnitude. And was there anything different, tripwire-wise that triggered the size and expansiveness of this charge? And I know you gave more color on the slip-out of the tanker, which seems to continue to happen. But maybe was there a tripwire? Number one. Number two, this -- forward losses that have accumulated on the balance sheet, the size of the headwind in \u201823 versus what you experienced in \u201822 would be helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Myles. Let me get to the last part. It\u2019s going to be about the same in terms of the headwind, to answer your last comment. Our BDS portfolio, the 85% of the business is doing pretty well. It\u2019s these fixed-price development programs that, unfortunately, we\u2019re working our way through. We had to account for recent performance, including a reassessment of our forecast cost to complete. There\u2019s no doubt about it. The biggest impact was the tanker, as you mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At $1.2 billion, it was driven by two things. The supply chain constraints and specifically part shortages have been persisting and they likely will persist longer than we had contemplated; and then, two, this labor instability. As you know, all airplane programs contemplate a learning curve improvement over time. And we adjusted our assumptions because labor stability is an issue that is likely to continue into the future. We can hire. It\u2019s getting the workforce trained and up to speed that we had to account for in this particular period. We applied the similar framework to the VC-25B, where the labor stability issues are magnified because of the requirement to get secured -- security clearances. And that\u2019s also contributed to schedule shifts. So, those are the two big ones. And it\u2019s just at this moment, the provision reflects what we think is likely to happen in front of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other bucket really relates to what I would call true development, which is MQ-25, T-7 and Commercial Crew. We did adjust for similar macro constraints where needed. But there\u2019s also a recognition, there\u2019s technical challenges that we\u2019re organized through and sometimes impact schedule. But overall, we feel very confident about those programs long term and the benefits that we\u2019ll accrue, once we get them out in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, there\u2019s no doubt that we derisk these programs. Now, the two big ones for the next two years, and I\u2019m not suggesting perfection, but we definitely lowered the risk profile. And for the smaller programs, in some cases, we derisked even longer. I think the thing we have to keep in mind is that our mandate is to stabilize and now deliver very important products to our customers who need them, anyway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then, just clarification on the tax refund, you\u2019ve had one last year this year. Do you anticipate another one next year, no?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Strauss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brian, you made the comment that I believe the recovery is not accelerating as fast as you expected. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll give us a lot more on this next week, but maybe some broad strokes as to what that means in terms of the trajectory of free cash flow generation from here in your ability to delever as you have a fair amount of maturities coming due in the first half of next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I\u2019d answer that question. We\u2019re confident that we will be able to satisfy the maturities in front of us. We\u2019ll talk a lot more about that. But, given the fact that where we ended the quarter with our cash balance, $14-plus billion, plus being able to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s not a concern. In terms of the rate of change, we have a supply chain, as Dave mentioned that we\u2019ve been dealing with, and that\u2019s been reflected in our commercial deliveries through the course of the year. And we\u2019re working our best to stabilize and get more predictable. But, while it may not be quite the rate of acceleration going forward, momentum is going to improve. It just could take a little bit longer, and we\u2019re going to share a lot more about that with you next week. But, in terms of our liquidity position, what\u2019s in front of us, high degree of confidence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Strauss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Quick follow-up. The airplanes that you have in inventory for China, how many of those have you remarketed at this point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, there\u2019s active discussions with customers about that topic. More to come in terms of things getting finalized, but it\u2019s an active discussion, so that we can no longer defer that decision and actually start to think about how we liquidate that in terms of working capital improvement and cash flow. More to come, and we\u2019ll keep you updated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Dave, maybe I could just circle back on the China question that David was just talking about. Have you seen any kind of positive movement from customers over there regarding wanting the MAX? And right now, you\u2019re up to 51% of the store fleet is tied to China with 138 aircraft. And just, how you\u2019re thinking about that because that obviously that percentage is going to continue to grow? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with my hope. My hope is that these two big geopolitical forces get together and endorse free trade again and COVID policy ultimately lightens sometime in the future in China so that they can take more deliveries of airplanes. So, we\u2019re going to keep supporting our customers, keep supporting their regulator every step of the way. But, we are also going to take steps to derisk. I have not gotten a single signal. And I\u2019m surprised by it. They\u2019re going to take deliveries in the near term. So, we are going to continue. We\u2019re going to -- we have begun and we\u2019re going to continue to remarket these airplanes as we move forward, and we\u2019re confident that there\u2019s a market for it, not a little market but a big market. In some ways, there are a lot of ways we could take advantage of it. I would prefer not to take advantage of it. I\u2019d prefer to just reinstate deliveries with our China customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But anyway, that\u2019s the course we\u2019re on. It hasn\u2019t really changed much. But it is really hard for me to find signals that things are going to change in China and move in our direction. So, hopefully, that will give you everything you need here in terms of the way we\u2019re likely to move.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just as a follow-up, Brian, just the 8 to 10 out of storage, is that still a good number on a monthly basis? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You mentioned on the call that your primary focus metric is going to be free cash flow. In the past, focusing on free cash flow got the Company to where it is today that didn\u2019t end very pretty. How are you viewing that differently than how it was viewed in the past? Dave, you were on the Board when a lot of the decisions were made in the past. So, what\u2019s -- how are you going to view this cash focus different than you did, call it\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Ron, I\u2019m not going to comment on the past. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s helpful to anybody. Our need to focus on free cash flow is a result of having taken a significant amount of debt on in light of the crisis that we had, some self-inflected; some definitely COVID related as it relates to the marketplace and all the things that we\u2019ve had to contend with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we took on a lot of debt. Shareholders told us it would be great if you got rid of that debt sooner rather than later. And so, we\u2019ve been focused on free cash flow. It is a great metric, period, in terms of how we measure all of our people and the work that we\u2019re doing. It does not suggest that we have stopped investing in new capabilities that will ultimately differentiate this company and bring it right back to the leadership role that\u2019s always enjoyed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I\u2019m probably not going to take the bait. I do have confidence that we are doing exactly what we need to be doing, and the free cash flow metric is a very clear indicator of performance, not just in the near term but also the medium and long term. So, I\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s the answer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, that\u2019s fine. And if I may, just a quick follow-on. Of the 787s you have in inventory, can you give us a sense on how many are like ready to be delivered, how many have to be depickled, how complicated a process that is?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thanks, Ron. They all have to go through a prescribed set of rework. We\u2019ve been very clear on that. And we\u2019ve contemplated what that is going to take. And now it\u2019s up to our great team in Charleston and in Everett to get that work done. And it\u2019s going well. It\u2019s early innings, but it\u2019s going well. And we have high confidence that they will get done what they need to do to get those inventoried airplanes in the customers\u2019 hands over the next two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, we\u2019ll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Seifman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on this issue of engines and castings. LEAP deliveries were up significantly in the third quarter. And it sounds like they see things getting better. I haven\u2019t gotten the impression from Airbus that they\u2019re expecting quite the pressures next year that you are. It seems like they expect that things are getting better. Is that because most of the LEAPs are going there and you guys have to wait longer, or is there more to it, or are these increasing CFM deliveries, is that not really enough to help you guys?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, just in context, things are getting better. They are getting your hands around things and they\u2019re beginning to project forward. The real issue for us is simply -- when I refer to constraints, it\u2019s because we have such huge demand for the airplanes that we wish we could do double the rates. That is why we will refer to this as a constraint and a difficulty. The measurement of where engines are going with respect to Airbus versus us is the easiest thing in the world to measure. And so, we\u2019re well aware of it, and we don\u2019t see any indication that one\u2019s being favored over another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, with respect to maybe suggestions that they\u2019re not having any trouble, that\u2019s not what the industry tells us. And frankly, that\u2019s up for them to explain and to all of you, and I\u2019m sure they will. So, I\u2019m not worried about this as the industry favoring one over the other. It\u2019s too easy for both sides to measure and to hold people accountable. And yes, it\u2019s improving, but it\u2019s nowhere near where we all want it to be because the demands -- or demand on our airplanes is just so strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Seifman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And just to be clear then, it is the engines though that is preventing Boeing from delivering 737s off the line between, let\u2019s say, the expected pace of 20 a month to be at a total delivery pace of low-30s versus the nominal production rate of 31 a month. So, they\u2019re only able to get you engines to deliver at roughly 20 planes per month or so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We\u2019re short of engines. We have a clear picture of what it\u2019s going to take to make it up, and we\u2019ll get back on rate. But yes, the answer is yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next, we\u2019ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Noah Poponak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A lot to work through, but it seems like what underpins some large portion of your challenges is labor availability, both for yourself, for the supply chain. It seems like it\u2019s behind a decent amount of the defense charges. Can you put some numbers on it? How many people do you need to hire? How far into that have you broken? When you say it takes time to get somebody trained and seasoned, how long does that take? And do you have those numbers in the castings part of the supply chain? I mean how many people do they need to hire? And how far along are they? And where are these people going to come from given the macro level openings versus workers\u2019 gap?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s a big complex and macro question. I\u2019ll start with us. We have brought on 10,000 people. We are at a headcount level that we think can handle rate increases and all the things that we need inside our own shop. We have significant training and development programs and investments that are being made as we speak, so that we are productive with the introduction of all of these new people.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have a number with respect to all of the supply chain constraints and labor shortages that they might have. But a lot of our constraints and -- with those suppliers that represent constraints are labor related. Some like in the casting world, are a little more labor and experience related because you may know in the casting world, that is not a simple process. It\u2019s not just bring in people and start them up. There\u2019s a real learning curve and cycle that is needed to sort of ramp up capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I don\u2019t have a sort of big number for you. I wish I did. I know this. All of us, all of us in this industry are wrestling through these constraints. We try to compare notes. We\u2019re trying to help our suppliers on the commodity side with our own contracts and the application of those contracts to their needs. And then on the labor side, anything that we can do to help them find people, that\u2019s what we do. And we often second or send our own people out there to help them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it\u2019s -- this is just what we\u2019re in. I think it\u2019s going to take probably all of next year before things really do begin to stabilize because we begin to see layoffs in other industries. We definitely feel that in the software world, we\u2019re not having any kind of trouble bringing in the engineering resources that we need, particularly as it relates to software development because the rest of the industry that competes with us is beginning to soften considerably. So I wish I had a big specific number and an easy resolution. I don\u2019t. This is what we\u2019re going to struggle through all year next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dave, a couple for you. You\u2019ve said numerous times today that demand is not the issue. So, I was going to ask if you could talk about the developing wide-body cycle and the environment for that. And could it mitigate some of the narrow-body issues in China, in other words, selling wide-bodies into China? And how might that influence your rate plan for 87 and 777 freighter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a great question. Number one, I -- the wide-body world is heating up. There are some significant orders out there that we\u2019re all competing for. So, that\u2019s just a reflection of the markets that are returning, largely in international base, but a lot of domestic carriers as well, so anyway, a big robust. The answer on China is just as you\u2019re suggesting and the premise that underlies it, which is -- that is the airplane they are going to likely need from us more than any other. They don\u2019t have a domestic alternative. And I don\u2019t believe that a single provider from France can meet those requirements, so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we do get orders, but they\u2019re -- I put them in the incremental category for airplanes, large wide-bodies, freighters in particular, from China. Does that ramp up? It\u2019s not something we\u2019re counting on, but it could. And if it does, that will compete for a very crowded skyline. So again, if China really does rebound and we can get the geopolitical tensions to calm down somewhat, that\u2019s going to present another challenge for us on the demand and the supply front, but one we would welcome and probably be upside to whatever guidance we provide next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And just to clarify, a slightly different topic. How does this BDS review differ from prior reviews? How confident are you that you\u2019ve captured everything here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll let Brian in to talk. So, the best, I mean, fact set that we can give is, number one, we\u2019re getting closer to the end of these programs. So, we\u2019re getting work done. We know more. We see more. We\u2019re also running out of time with respect to learning curves. There\u2019s no time to develop learning curves. They take a couple of years. We don\u2019t have a couple of years. We\u2019re -- so we don\u2019t have any baked-in learning curves anymore. We are simply saying these supply constrained -- supply constraints that we\u2019re facing today will not end until we finish. So, we\u2019re trying to assess these programs with real clarity and realism with respect to what we\u2019re experiencing now and not projecting significant improvements in the future. So, it\u2019s -- for me, that\u2019s sort of the set around it. It\u2019s definitely the way we went into it. And of course, Brian has been through every little detail. So Brian, I\u2019ll let you add.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have much to add other than we sit in this environment and you can\u2019t ignore these macro constraints and how they impact these programs. And that just is what happened this quarter. But the thing that we\u2019ve done our best to do is derisk, and derisk, as Dave mentioned, some of these assumptions and future cost forecasts. So, we like where we closed the quarter of our position. We do it every quarter, and we feel confident. This particular quarter, it really was the recognition of the very rapidly changing environment that is persistent, and can\u2019t assume it\u2019s going to get better anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I guess, I kind of get the $2.8 billion on the development program, although that seems large. What confuses me is that excluding the $2.8 billion all those mature programs, F-18, F-15, Apache, et cetera, look like they\u2019re at breakeven. They\u2019re making no money when Lockheed and GV have their issues, but basically the mature stuff is doing okay, how come?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brian, you probably want to grab that one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw across some of these other programs, similar disruptions in terms of both, factory stability, part shortages, labor. So, those weren\u2019t immune at all. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re not magnified in the sense that there are these big fixed price development programs that have these reach forward losses embedded in them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know in making comparisons across our companies, our BDS is programs only. It\u2019s not including the government services part of our business, which continues to run at reasonably healthy margins and does its things. So, I know you know that, but I just want to point it out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then -- so I mean, we\u2019ve seen sort of a whole set here. We thought first quarter, $900 million, got it done. Now we have $2.8 billion. What should we be looking for to see -- to feel confident that, in fact, you guys really are out of the woods at BDS?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Better numbers, better performance, better everything. So, I don\u2019t want to tell you anything other than that. Our objective is to make sure these tankers are doing the job for our military customer. That is it. That\u2019s all we\u2019re focused on. And they are doing that. And they are now permitted to do all the missions that are required.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we are knocking down risk and we are implementing these programs. And so, I am confident we\u2019re going to get where we need to get, and you\u2019ll be confident when you see the numbers play out the way I expect them to play out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know, better than anyone, these are complicated programs, lots of assumptions, lots of moving parts, backdrop of a volatile environment. We did our very best to derisk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt Welch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for one last question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that will come from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to go back to the MAX rate and engines,, because on the earlier -- I think Seth\u2019s question earlier talked about the LEAPs out there, and we\u2019re looking at GE just reported 347 LEAP deliveries for the quarter. We are seeing Airbus finally, and they\u2019ve struggled. But finally, that -- the LEAP-powered A320 seemed to be coming through. When I look at -- if we look at the numbers and you had sort of that target production rate of 31 a month and look at what Airbus is doing, it seems like CFM is finally getting there. And then on top of it, we know that well over 100 LEAPs were delivered ahead of production before. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how the engines can be the main constraint here. Is there another issue that\u2019s also slowing down the delivery rate or the -- I\u2019m sorry, the production rate?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Calhoun</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, no, I can try to reconcile numbers. All I can tell you is I personally witnessed alongside my counterpart the reconciliation of the engines we need to deliver the airplanes and the engines they\u2019re producing on weekly rates. And so, we just have -- we have a gap. We got room to make up. And we\u2019re going to get there, but it\u2019s going to be at a constrained rate and we know that. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to factor into our forward looks,, and that is what you will see when we get together next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, there\u2019s no -- there is no other constraint, Doug, with respect to our rate projections and others. There are lots of weekly constraints that just simply impact the stability of the line, but they are not going to be rate limiters, either short term or long term. It will boil down to engines and the competition for castings between Pratt and CFM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, if I can just follow up with one more thing, which when you guided early in the year to positive free cash flow for the year, was that including the assumption of this tax benefit that we saw this quarter? Because just wondering if you\u2019re thinking about positive free cash flow still in the absence of that sort of $1.6 billion additional benefit here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was contemplated, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So, that\u2019s part of the outlook you had. Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian West</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Welch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right.
