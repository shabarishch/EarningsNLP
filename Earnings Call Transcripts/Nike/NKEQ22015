In the event you have additional questions not covered by others, please feel free to re-queue and we will do our best to come back to you. Thanks for your help with this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nike, Inc. President and CEO Mark Parker.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Parker</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Kelley, and hello, everyone, and happy holidays. Q2 was another outstanding quarter for Nike, and it demonstrates our ability to continue to drive strong, profitable, sustainable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the quarter, Nike Inc. revenues increased 15% to $7.4 billion. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points, diluted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.74, and we continue to deliver strong returns as our ROIC reached 27% and we increased our dividend for the 13th year in a row.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Delivering results like these requires a sharp focus on our growth opportunities, making disciplined choices to invest in those areas with the highest potential for return. The world of sport is constantly evolving as is the environment in which we operate. That opens up new opportunities for Nike every day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But to identify and capitalize on those opportunities, we have to stay nimble. We need to balance making critical investments with managing risks, whether they be currency headwinds, commodity cost fluctuations, or an evolving political landscape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The word \u201cbalance\u201d is key. To capture the tremendous growth potential we see for Nike, we must invest, and a targeted approach to making the right investments helps us drive growth and manage risk. It\u2019s a winning strategy that has allowed us to deliver profitable, sustainable growth quarter after quarter, year after year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, I\u2019m often asked how we can continue to grow, how there could still be places where Nike isn\u2019t fully distributed. When I look at the potential in our business, I actually see the exact opposite. The more we focus on knowing, connecting, and serving the consumer, the more opportunity I see for growth and when we capture those opportunities by leveraging the power of the Nike Inc. portfolio. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s take apparel as an example. Today, Nike is one of the largest apparel brands in the world. But as we look up and down our apparel business, we see tremendous opportunity, from premium performance apparel to signature sportswear styles, from running, to basketball, to global football, from North America, to Western Europe, to China, from the Nike brand to Brand Jordan, to Converse, across men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and young athletes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And within each of those dimensions, we segment further and further to find even more opportunity to drive growth. Our diverse set of brands, categories, geographies, product types, and distribution channels provides a competitive advantage that is unmatched, and our relentless focus on serving the consumer allows us to see ever-expanding opportunities for growth within our existing portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Trevor will talk in more depth about our growth drivers in the Nike brand, but let me highlight two additional areas that we\u2019ve been investing in to accelerate growth in our business. First, our women\u2019s business. In October, I was honored to be a part of a powerful moment for Nike Women\u2019s. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We introduced our spring/summer 2015 collections in New York City with 27 of the world\u2019s top athletes. It was amazing to have Grand Slam winners, world record holders, and Olympic champions all in one place at the same time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We were also there to spotlight an important cultural shift that\u2019s happening, and sport is powering women\u2019s lives like never before. We see it every day in our digital community of 65 million women, and women are driving a larger global movement of health and fitness. They\u2019re running in record numbers, they\u2019re engaging in new kinds of workouts and athletic activities at a rapid pace, and that means they have new needs, which are creating new insights and inspiring new products and services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we\u2019re driving growth in our women\u2019s business. There is tremendous energy in women\u2019s and a significant opportunity for us in this important business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second is our digital strategy. We see digital as an integrated ecosystem of digital communication with consumers, digital products and services to inspire and motivate, and of course ecommerce. All three dimensions work together to deliver premium personalized experiences for our consumers and drive growth for Nike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consumers are engaging with technology in new ways. It\u2019s transforming the sport experience and the way in which we connect with them. Athletes are getting a better understanding of themselves and their potential than they\u2019ve ever had before, and we\u2019re able to connect personally with more consumers than ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Digital is where the consumer is today, and where they will be going forward, and we\u2019re excited about the potential of leveraging digital technology to further drive innovation and continue to deliver increasingly seamless digital experiences for our consumers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going a little bit deeper on ecommerce, it continues to deliver, with growth of 65% for the quarter. Our investments in infrastructure are really paying off in this space. We\u2019re making it easier for consumers to buy our products and we\u2019re presenting the brand in the most premium way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With opportunity for even more innovation and expansion into new markets, this really is just the beginning of what\u2019s possible for Nike.com. Ecommerce is, without a doubt, one of our biggest and most important growth opportunities, and it will be for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the reasons I\u2019m so confident in our growth potential for Nike.com, and really, across our entire portfolio, is because Nike is relentless. We are always striving to deliver something better for the athlete and the consumer. We are, in a word, obsessed, and that obsession fuels innovation. Since day one, we\u2019ve looked to athletes as a source of inspiration, and that hasn\u2019t changed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What has changed is the pace at which athletes demand more of themselves. As they strive for new levels of performance, they demand products that help them get stronger, faster, and more agile, really better in every way. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that pushes us to deliver innovative products and services that go beyond what anyone thought was possible. And it requires us to accelerate the pace of our innovation, to improve not only what we make, but how we make it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, we have tools and resources available to us that would have been unimaginable five years ago, from 3D printers, to high-performance knitting machines, to advanced textiles, just to name a few. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re not only focused on the quantum leaps in product innovation. Equally exciting is our focus on continuously evolving our existing and proven performance technologies. Nike Air continues to be reinvented, as does Nike Free, Lunar, and Tech Fleece. We create products that are completely new and we make our existing products better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We introduce game-changing innovation in every category in every global market, and at scale. No one else can deliver innovation like Nike can, and that is our greatest competitive advantage as a company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our ability to leverage and scale this innovation through compelling concepts and technologies across our portfolio of brands and categories, geographies and distribution channels, and on the world\u2019s best athletes and teams, is driving tremendous growth for Nike around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And while I\u2019m proud of the results we\u2019re reporting today, I assure you that we are hungry, we\u2019re driven, and we are laser focused on the future. Our success lies in our ability to see what is possible and then relentlessly pursue it, to stay aggressive always, and remembering, as we say every day here at Nike, the consumer decides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our business has breadth and depth at a scale that is unmatched in our industry, and we have the leadership team and the strategy to drive sustainable growth. That is what you\u2019ve seen from Nike in the past and that is what you can continue to expect from us going forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, and now here\u2019s Trevor. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Trevor Edwards</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark. Happy holidays, everyone. Our strong second quarter results demonstrate the tremendous momentum of the Nike brand. Let\u2019s take a look at the numbers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a constant currency basis, Nike brand revenue grew 17%. All geographies grew in the quarter, as did all categories except golf. The Nike brand DTC revenue increased 30%, driven by all concepts. Notably, our online business continues to be very strong, with 66% growth in the quarter, and global futures are up 11%, even as we anniversary the strong World Cup order in the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The reason we deliver strong growth across our geographies and categories time and time again is clear. We never lose focus on serving our consumers. As always, these strong relationships are fueled by the power of our brands and the category offence. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the category offense deepens our relationship with consumers by serving them through the lens of sport that matters most to them, as they compete, train, and express themselves. In other words, we live where they live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What\u2019s more, only Nike has the broad portfolio and global reach to execute this strategy around the world. We know what works, and we know how to identify large, untapped opportunities, develop innovative products and marketing strategies on a global scale, and execute them effectively in each marketplace around the world. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s look at two examples of the category offense at work: basketball and our women\u2019s business. It\u2019s no secret why we succeed in basketball. Our relationship with the world\u2019s best athletes provide us great insight that produce incredible product innovation, and these products, in turn, excite and inspire consumers all over the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Q2 was the 13th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth for our basketball category. Our position as the world\u2019s leader in basketball was supported by strong sell through of key Nike basketball footwear styles like the LeBron 12 and the KD7. And the Jordan brand remains a powerful growth driver, with performance products like the Air Jordan 29 as well as rereleases like the Retro Jordan 6.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You can see this energy come to life with growth throughout the marketplace, from performance to sportswear, and across footwear and apparel styles. Retail destinations like our own DTC stores or the House of Hoops, with Footlocker, remain go-to locations for those who love the sport.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And momentum in this category is not limited to North America. We\u2019re also seeing great consumer response to basketball retail destinations in Europe and China, which help us realize the significant potential of these growing markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s take a look at the women\u2019s business. As Mark mentioned, the momentum we\u2019re seeing in this business is incredible. The energy was certainly visible at our recent women\u2019s event in New York. I will never forget the thrill of seeing some of the world\u2019s greatest athletes, including Li Na, Allyson Felix, and Skylar Diggins discussing their successes and the power of women in sports. It was truly inspiring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look forward, we remain on the path to meet our goal of a $7 million women\u2019s business by fiscal year 2017. We achieve this by making deep connections with consumers in the areas most important to them: running, training, and sportswear. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strategy means connecting and serving millions of women through the digital platforms, elevating the online and in-store shopping experiences, offering premium product assortments that drive real growth and as always, leading with innovative products. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These products offer consumer great fit and amazing style like never before, and they\u2019re presented at retail in a compelling and captivating way. Great product examples from the quarter include the Nike Pro Base Layer collection and the continued strength of the Nike Pro bra as well as performance inspired style of the Air Max collection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What\u2019s more, we opened women\u2019s-only Nike stores in Newport Beach and Shanghai to strong consumer response. Ultimately, we see Q2 as just the beginning of great things to come in our women\u2019s business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s turn to a few of our key geographies. In North America, we delivered another great quarter with Q2 revenue growth of 16%. That growth proves yet again the success of our strategies. For us, North America offers a roadmap for other geographies as we continue to deliver strong growth in this critical marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By developing deep consumer relationships through the category offense, and delivering segmented and differentiated retail destination, we have driven sustained, profitable growth even in more developed markets where we already have significant market share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our brand continues to resonate with consumers in North America, which is driving growth in nearly every category. Basketball, sportswear, and men\u2019s training have continued to perform well, and we\u2019ve seen clear acceleration in our women\u2019s and young athletes businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Working with our partners, we\u2019ve continued to see growth as we further transform the marketplace. In executions such as the Field House, with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, the Track Club, at the Finish Line, and the young athletes concept Fly Zone with Foot Locker.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, our DTC business has continued to expand, with an increase of 18% in Q2. By providing the products and the experiences our consumers demand, we expect to continue to drive growth in our largest geography.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In greater China, we continue to see the benefits of our strategy to reset the marketplace. Q2 revenue growth of 21% reflects our plan to deploy a more consumer centric distribution strategy, and this approach is definitely working. The Nike brand is exceptionally strong with consumers in China, and we hold the number one market share position in both athletic footwear and apparel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our leadership position as a premium performance brand allows us to present the innovative products in the most compelling retail destinations in the marketplace. As a result, our whole partners have continued to see strong comp store growth and expanding profitability in the doors that have been reprofiled. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This success mirrors the exceptional numbers we\u2019ve seen in our own doors. We\u2019ve driven this return to growth by focusing on increased retail productivity, differentiating our point of distribution and creating more focused consumer experiences. This allows us to provide a narrow but deep product assortment in each door. This better serves the consumer and also allows us to maintain the healthy inventory levels we are currently seeing in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain confident that we have the right strategy to drive a sustainable, profitable growth in China over the long term. Now let\u2019s turn to the emerging markets, which delivered 13% revenue growth in the quarter, every territory except Mexico and Korea, with five of them growing at a double digit rate. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also saw strong performance coming from sportswear and basketball categories in the quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed, inventory levels in Mexico remain high. This is primarily the result of an inconsistent flow of product to our wholesale partners following transition issues with our distribution center in the early fiscal year 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to work aggressively to clear excess inventory and expect to return to more normalized levels by the end of fiscal year 2015. As with every territory in the world, our goal is to operate a healthy [pull] market, and we believe we are taking the necessary actions to achieve that goal in Mexico.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Brazil, Q2 revenue growth slowed, as volatile macroeconomic conditions make for a more challenging environment. That said, we see this environment as an opportunity to do what we do best, accelerate our transformation of the marketplace, fueled by the category offense. The consumer\u2019s passion for sport and the Nike brand remain strong, and we are focused on creating elevated and differentiated retail experiences for our consumers in Brazil, as we have done in North America, Western Europe, and China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Online executions through Nike.com will serve as the most premium expression of the brand, offering rich product assortments across a broad range of categories. We are also working with our wholesale partners to create compelling destinations at retail, with a focus on our biggest categories: running, football, and sportswear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Near term, we are working to keep the market healthy in Brazil. We are proactively managing the flow of product into the marketplace, whilst also swiftly working to clear any excess inventory through the closeout channel. Long term, we remain confident that the emerging markets geography will drive significant growth for the Nike brand. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at Western Europe. With revenue up 24% in the quarter, we continue to see strong momentum for the Nike brand. The exceptional growth was driven by our relentless focus on the consumer and our work to transform the marketplace in line with the category offense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to develop more differentiated retail executions, both in our stores and with our wholesale partners, while continuing to flow amazing products into the marketplace. All this combined to expand the market and help us take market share. Wholesale partners like Foot Locker, JD Sports, and Intersport are creating compelling category destinations in cities across the geography that are fueling growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just as we\u2019ve seen in North America, our DTC business in Western Europe also continues to perform very well, delivering 40% growth in the quarter. This resulted in a double digit revenue growth in every territory and strong growth across nearly every category, with sportswear, football, and running leading the way. Western Europe is a perfect example of the tremendous opportunity that lies ahead for the Nike brand to drive long term growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we finish the first half of the year, the Nike brand has never been stronger. By staying focused on the needs of the consumer, we have driven exceptional revenue and profit growth. While we feel great about the results we\u2019ve delivered to date, we\u2019re never satisfied. Like the athletes we serve, our focus is always on continuing to elevate our performance, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in the second half of the year and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, now here\u2019s Don. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Don Blair</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Trevor. You\u2019ve often heard us use the phrase, \u201cNike is a growth company.\u201d Over our history, we\u2019ve delivered sustained growth in revenues, profits, and cash returns to shareholders. The level we\u2019ve delivered in recent years is particularly distinctive in today\u2019s highly volatile and growth challenged environment, but the phrase is more than a description of the results we\u2019ve produced. It\u2019s a key element of our business philosophy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nike as a growth company is embodied in the Nike maxims, the principles we use to define our corporate culture. Nike is a growth company means that our potential is continuously expanding, and that the numbers, like the current size of a market or a previous peak profit margin, are only signposts, not limits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It means we can create growth by investing to build deep personal connections with athletes and consumers, by investing to deliver exceptional product innovations and by investing to create premium integrated marketplaces. And Nike as a growth company means we can leverage our global portfolio and operating capabilities to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, manage risk, and create shareholder value. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that introduction, I\u2019ll now recap our Q2 results. Second quarter reported revenue for Nike Inc. increased 15%. On a currency neutral basis, revenue increased 18%, as the Nike brand grew 17% and Converse increased 24%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also on a currency neutral basis, Nike brand futures ordered grew 11%, driven by a 6% increase in average selling price and a 5% increase in units. The growth reflects continued strong demand for the Nike brand, even as we anniversary robust prior year orders for global football product in advance of the 2014 World Cup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding global football, total futures order growth this quarter was essentially in line with the numbers we reported last quarter. Specifically, this quarter\u2019s futures growth was led by double digit expansion in North America, Europe, and Greater China, with strong demand across multiple categories including sportswear, basketball, and running.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a reported basis, futures grew 7%, reflecting weaker international currencies, particularly the euro, Argentine peso, ruble, and yen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second quarter diluted EPS increased 25% to $0.74, driven by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and a lower share count, partially offset by higher SG&amp;A investments. Gross margin expanded 120 basis points in the quarter. The increase was driven by a mix shift to higher margin products, continued growth in our higher margin DTC business, and a modest benefit from FX, partially offset by higher product input costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second quarter demand creation spending increased 11%, driven by digital brand marketing, sports marketing, and consumer events around the globe. Q2 operating overhead increased 19%, reflecting growth in our higher gross margin and higher cost DTC business, targeted investments in operational infrastructure, and continued investments in digital, including consumer engagement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Q2 effective tax rate was 25.4%, a 20 basis point increase, primarily due to adjustments to tax expense on intercompany transactions and the benefit realized in the prior period from the U.S. R&amp;D Tax Credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These items were partially offset by an increase in earnings from operations outside the U.S., which are generally subject to a lower tax rate and the resolution of tax audits across multiple jurisdictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventories at November 30 were up 11% and remain healthy overall, with the majority of the growth in North America, Europe, and Converse, and driven in part by the expansion of our DTC business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to focus on inventory management, with particular attention on Brazil and Mexico, where we\u2019re working to balance supply and demand to position those markets for ongoing growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s take a look at some performance highlights by segment. In North America, Q2 revenue increased 16% on both a reported and currency neutral basis, led by double-digit growth in the basketball, sportswear, men\u2019s training, and women\u2019s training categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Direct to consumer revenues grew 18%, driven by 8% comp store sales growth, continued strong growth of Nike.com, and new stores.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT for North America grew 21%, driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion. In Western Europe, Q2 revenues increased 24% on a currency neutral basis. The growth was broad-based, as every territory increased at a double digit rate. Every key category also grew, led by double-digit growth for sportswear, football, and running. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a reported basis, Q2 revenue for Western Europe increased 22%. Second quarter EBIT increased 112%, driven primarily by strong revenue growth, gross margin expansion, and SG&amp;A leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">EBIT growth for Western Europe also benefited from two nonoperating items: a legal charge included in last year\u2019s Q2 results, and more favorable standardized exchange rates that we use for our geography segment reporting. The latter upside was largely offset within the corporate segment of our consolidated results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenue in Central and Eastern Europe accelerated in the quarter, expanding 25% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding Israel, every territory reported double digit revenue growth, and every key category expanded, except action sports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite strong FX headwinds, reported revenue for CEE grew 17%, and EBIT grew 19%, driven by strong revenue growth and SG&amp;A leverage. In Greater China, currency neutral and reported revenue grew 21%, led by double-digit growth in sportswear, running, and basketball.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Trevor discussed, the Nike brand continues to lead the market, and we\u2019re pleased with the results of our work to reset the marketplace for sustainable, profitable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a reported basis, Q2 EBIT in greater China increased 31%, driven by strong revenue growth and significant gross margin expansion, partially offset by increased investments in DTC and our new Shanghai campus. Given the continuing benefits of our strategy to reset the market, we now expect full year FY15 revenue in China to grow at a mid-teens rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the emerging markets geography, Q2 revenue grew 13% on a currency neutral basis, as all territories except Mexico and Korea posted higher revenues. From a category perspective, the growth was led by sportswear, basketball, and running.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Reported Q2 results in the emerging markets geography reflected the translation and gross margin impact of strong FX headwinds, as reported revenue increased only 4% and EBIT decreased 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The reduction in profitability was primarily due to lower gross margin and higher operating overhead for new retail stores. We continue to be confident in the long term growth potential for the territories that comprise our emerging markets geography, and as Trevor discussed earlier, we\u2019re executing plans in each of them to realize that potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Converse, revenue grew 24% on a currency neutral basis, driven by continued strength in existing direct distribution markets such as the U.S., the growth of DTC, and market conversions in Europe and Asia. On a reported basis, revenue increased 21% but EBIT decreased 12%, driven by investments in infrastructure, demand creation, and DTC to enable long term growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the last 90 days, we\u2019ve seen our business performance accelerate and we expect that trend to continue into the second half of fiscal 2015. At the same time, the dollar has strengthened against most other currencies and the FX markets have been extremely volatile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While our trading company structure and hedge programs do protect us from some of that volatility, we cannot entirely eliminate all FX risk. Based on what we know today, we expect the net impact of these two factors, the strengthening currency neutral business performance and the downside from the stronger dollar, will net together to deliver full year results largely in line with the expectations we shared 90 days ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specifically, for Q3 we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low teens, with reported revenue growth of about 3 points lower, reflecting the stronger dollar. For the full year, we expect constant dollar revenue growth in the low double-digits, with reported revenue growth 2 to 3 points lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect gross margin for Q3 to expand by about 100 basis points. Growth in our higher margin businesses, including DTC, and strategies to increase average selling prices will continue into the second half of the year. These benefits will help to offset increases in product input costs, our actions to clear excess inventory in the emerging markets, and increased FX pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, we now expect gross margin expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect demand creation to grow at a high single to low double digit rate for Q3, and at a high single-digit rate for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating overhead is now expected to grow at a high teens rate for Q3 and the full year, reflecting higher variable DTC expenses as well as investments in digital innovation, new operating capabilities, and expanded capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to expect the effective tax rate for FY15 will be approximately 24.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you\u2019ve heard from all three of us today, we\u2019re pleased with the results we\u2019ve delivered in the first half of FY15 and the momentum we see in our business. And notwithstanding the volatility we\u2019ve seen recently in the macro-environment, we\u2019re confident we\u2019re on track to deliver strong growth for this fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re now ready to take your questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions.] The first question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Omar Saad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just really wanted to ask a follow up question on the gross margin line, Don. It\u2019s still great expansion year over year. I think maybe you missed your projection for the second quarter a little bit. Kind of wondering, what are the swing factors quarter to quarter near term? Is it FX and input costs, and then if those are the two big factors, we can see FX, but how should we be thinking about oil and some of the other input costs that go in there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Don Blair</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, first of all, we gave a range on gross margin and our actual results were really essentially in line with that range. And as we\u2019ve talked about before, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in gross margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look forward with gross margin, FX is one of the things that\u2019s changing between the second quarter and where we expect the third quarter to be. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had a very small FX upside in Q2, basically because of our hedge positions. For FY15 Q3, so next quarter, we are expecting that to start turning into a headwind. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So yes, FX is the major driver. When you look at the underlying fundamentals of gross selling price improvements versus input costs, we\u2019re continuing to make great progress from an operating standpoint on expanding margins. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Robbie Ohms with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Ohmes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Don, you called out in gross margin one of the drivers as mix shift to higher margin products. Can we get some insight into are you speaking about higher margins on some of the new apparel you\u2019re doing? Or is it certain sneaker styles? What type of products are you mix shifting towards?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the second question was, I might have missed it, but you guys called out a lot of great things with momentum, but I don\u2019t remember hearing Nike Free, or the word Fly Knit, or running in the U.S., but I just wanted to double check if I maybe missed something on one of those three things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Don Blair </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, on your first question, this is a trend that we\u2019ve seen for quite a while now, which is that with the strength of our brand and the flow of innovation we have into the marketplace, we have been essentially trading the consumer up to premium product. And that\u2019s both on the apparel and the footwear side. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s things like Tech Fleece on the sportswear front in apparel or just generally the performance apparel we\u2019ve seen in running, as well as a number of other performance categories. And on the footwear side, it\u2019s marquee footwear styles, running, basketball, sportswear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So what this is is that long term trend to building product that\u2019s premium for the consumer and can carry that price premium. And I\u2019m going to hand the second question off to Trevor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Trevor Edwards </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I\u2019ll jump in there. Obviously, as we go through the results, there\u2019s a number of categories and dimensions of the business, so we always try and give you maybe just some different flavors as to how the business is doing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So maybe speaking specifically about running, we feel good about the running category. It\u2019s our biggest category and it\u2019s what we always described as we really operate the complete offense. In terms of growth, for the quarter we actually saw mid to high single digit pace growth in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the growth, it was actually pretty widespread. We saw particular strength in Europe as well as in China. In Europe, both dimensions of Europe, so Central Eastern Europe as well as Western Europe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you dive down specifically into North America, what we have been seeing, which is really across the board, our premium products are doing exceptionally well across the marketplace. And so all the premium products, whether it\u2019s the Structure, the Pegasus, the Lunar Glides, those are all doing really well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Where we have opportunity is really more in the lower price points and we are actively working to get onto that, and so we are bringing better products in the marketplace, and we will be doing that. But all in all, we feel very good about our running business across the board, but clearly there\u2019s some opportunity for us to continue to make sure we sharpen our focus along the lines of the complete offense. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as the Free and Fly Knit innovation from Nike, as I said before, I continue to be very bullish on both those areas of our innovation agenda. I recently spent time in our advanced R&amp;D looking at some of the new concepts coming down the pipe here, some sooner than later. Very exciting developments in the free category as well as Fly Knit. And we continue to be as bullish as we ever have been on the potential, as far as both those areas are concerned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first one is, I think the China growth, I think you now are looking for midteens. I think that\u2019s an improvement from the prior outlook. And I just wondered if you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of what\u2019s developing there, how everything is going on the footwear side and the apparel side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Trevor Edwards </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, great question, obviously. You know, as we\u2019ve always been talking about, we\u2019ve implemented a reset strategy in China, and we feel very confident that the reset strategy is working, as you could see certainly with the growth of 21%. We felt great about that result. We also see futures up 13% as a very good indication that all our strategies are in place and we\u2019re building them into the fundamentals of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so as you\u2019ll remember, the key to the strategy was making sure that we would drive more profitable and productive retail, and so we\u2019re seeing both of those dimensions really hit. Both were actually increasing the sell through of product, but it\u2019s also at a much more profitable rate. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we feel that we\u2019re actually doing all the things that we\u2019ve talked about. We feel very good about the continued trend on the China business. The metrics continue to show that when you look into working with our partners, their doors continue to profile really well. So again, we feel very good and the inventories in the marketplace are very clean. So all the dimensions of those businesses will suggest that we will continue to see continued strong growth in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll just add that the strength of the brand in China is tremendous. The response to the product that we\u2019ve introduced is also quite strong. We\u2019ve obviously made measures to increase our productivity at retail, and we\u2019re leveraging that across both our own doors and our partner doors in China. So we\u2019re very excited about all of that. And then as Trevor said, the inventory situation is actually quite good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re bullish on the opportunity, and I\u2019ll mention too that we just launched dot com here less than about seven months ago in China, and the response there has exceeded our expectations. So that\u2019s another great opportunity for us. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Drbul </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I just have a quick follow up question. Can you just elaborate on the plans, as you think about FY15 versus next year, how are you guys going to comp against the success that the Ducks have had, and the Heisman Trophy winner from the University of Oregon?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[laughter] That\u2019s a good one. That\u2019s a tough one to beat. We\u2019re very excited about the football championships, and we\u2019re very happy for whichever Nike team wins. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lindsay Drucker Mann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It seems as if every other global consumer products company is complaining about a very challenging macro dynamic. Outside of the currency issues that you guys highlighted, are there any markets where you\u2019re starting to see the second derivative turn a little bit softer, where you feel a little bit more cautious about or some disconnect between sell in and sell through? Or is your performance really as good as it seems?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Don Blair </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you say second derivatives, you mean just overall consumer trends?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lindsay Drucker Mann </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, one of the things I\u2019d say, just as an opening, is generally what we\u2019ve found is our product and our brand are really the keys to how successful we are in a lot of these markets. And as long as we don\u2019t see huge moves in the macroeconomics, we believe that we can continue to generate growth in the business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve generally seen that to be the case around the world. There are a few places where we\u2019ve seen some of the macros start to, at least in the near term, affect consumer confidence. Brazil\u2019s an example of that. Certainly we think over time we\u2019ve got to keep a close eye on Russia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But generally, what we\u2019ve found is our product is one of those things that consumers find ways to continue to buy and as long as we keep the brand hot and the product right and the distribution premium, I think we\u2019ll do fine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Trevor Edwards </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe just to jump in there too, I would say that we also believe that with the category offense, it provides us an ability to continue to bring innovation on multiple dimensions all the time. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in many of the marketplaces. So we have been able to somewhat, so to speak, buck the trend. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Having said that, Brazil is clearly one of the markets that we\u2019re continuing to work on, to make sure that we stay ahead of that curve, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re working to accelerate the marketplace and make sure that we continue to implement our category offense more aggressively in that market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lindsay Drucker Mann </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019ve talked about a strategy to take sort of ongoing inflationary price increases to offset what you had believed was sort of input cost inflation for an extended horizon. Has the move in commodity markets changed your view on pricing going forward? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Don Blair </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, let me wind back to the first part of that question. We actually are not pricing literally with either inflation or input cost. One of the changes that we made over the last five years or so is really focusing on the consumer as we set price. And really, it\u2019s about the value equation that we\u2019re trying to create with the consumer. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so when we bring innovation and brand strength and premium presentation at retail to the consumer, then you can move the consumer to premium prices. So we will obviously keep a very close eye on the consumer value equation. We are managing our entire P&amp;L, including margins and costs and revenue and so on, and so yes, it\u2019s part of the calculus, but the pricing is really focused on maintaining the right consumer value equation in the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Duffy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Trevor, a question for you. Visiting a number of the stores recently, the premiumization of the apparel is very evident. It also appears that the apparel collection is more tightly edited than in the past. Is that accurate? And can you also comment on the impact that you\u2019ve seen on apparel conversion in your direct to consumer, with the directional change?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Trevor Edwards </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I think you\u2019re very astute, because absolutely that is what is taking place. I think on multiple dimensions. For instance, if you break into our apparel business and you break it out by segment, certainly you go by the women\u2019s business. Our apparel business is doing very, very well. We\u2019ve tightened the collections down. We\u2019ve made sure that they actually work across the line. So we\u2019ve seen really good strong conversions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our apparel business within our own doors does exceptionally well. Our sportswear business, or the example of the Tech Pack, which we think is a great item and collection, actually, that\u2019s working across the business. So we\u2019re seeing strong conversion across.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one of the things that we\u2019re learning, which I think Mark has always talked about this, which is by being a better retailer, we actually are better with our wholesale partners. So we\u2019re taking that same knowledge of tightening the assortment and making sure that we apply that in the broader marketplace. And so we think that\u2019s actually what\u2019s driving the great growth that we\u2019re seeing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, I will say, we\u2019re known for our footwear innovation. We\u2019re actually accelerating our commitment to innovation in apparel, and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to shine, I think, is to continue to really stand out from a performance premium apparel position, and then leverage that across what we talk about as our complete offense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve done that, and where we\u2019ve really gotten a lead on that, we\u2019ve seen the consumer response has been actually quite positive. So as an innovation geek, product geek, I\u2019m incredibly excited about applying that even more aggressively to the apparel side of our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Jay Sole with Morgan Stanley. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Sole</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There were some interesting comments in the beginning when you were talking about how you see a big apparel opportunity, how you\u2019re investing in the Nike women\u2019s business and you\u2019re seeing incredible momentum there. At the end of last year, the men\u2019s business was almost three times as big as the women\u2019s business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if we think about it from a big picture perspective, what\u2019s the opportunity to close that gap over time, given the momentum you\u2019re seeing, given the investments you\u2019re making? And can you talk about maybe some structural reasons why the gap can\u2019t be the same eventually?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the opportunity I spoke to a little bit in my remarks, we\u2019re seeing a big shift in women\u2019s, just in terms of their participation in sports and being more physical. We\u2019re seeing that online with the number of women we have participating in our Nike Plus and our training applications online. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the relationship we have with the women and the trend that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s not really a trend, as I call it. It\u2019s more of a cultural shift. So the appetite is there for more active product, and we\u2019re seeing that in both footwear and apparel. So the opportunity to really start to close that gap is tremendous. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we think that over the years ahead, we\u2019ll start to reduce that differentiation between men\u2019s as a percentage of Nike\u2019s business versus women\u2019s. So very, very bullish on the women\u2019s opportunity and the response to the work that we\u2019ve already done in elevating that part of our product and our communication. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Trevor Edwards </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, and I think as Mark just touched on, it really speaks to why we think the women\u2019s is such a big and huge opportunity for us, and why we\u2019re very focused on it. We believe we are absolutely on target to go after our $7 billion goal for fiscal year 2017, but we truly believe it\u2019s not about that, it\u2019s actually about beyond, continuing to really move the needle around our women\u2019s business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Michael Binetti with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Binetti </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just quickly on the China business, it\u2019s interesting because you guys used to give a fairly detailed report card, as you started to really go into the active mode of repairing that business. Maybe we can look at just where we are in that business now as far as you were controlling inventories for a long time, working with the retailers to improve the presentation at retail and put some capex into those stores. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess numerically, it\u2019s very interesting to see 20% revenue growth off of 6% futures, and now that you\u2019ve accelerated the futures to 13, how do we think about that spread going forward without getting to carried away with what we can look at? It certainly doesn\u2019t point me intuitively to a midteens revenue growth for the year. So just any help there would be great. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think first of all, you\u2019re right, in the previous quarters we were giving you a pretty detailed articulation, and one of the things we said that was because of the prior year comparisons, the futures growth rate and the revenue growth rates were not going to look all that obvious or all that intuitive, so that\u2019s why we gave much more specific guidance on that market than we normally do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And once again, this quarter we gave revenue guidance of mid-teens growth for the year, because it is a little hard to read the futures and the revenue growth, just because of the prior year. Once we get past this fiscal year, we\u2019re going to start to be anniversarying numbers that are a little more consistent, and we can go back to fairly normal relationships between futures and revenue. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But for right now, what we would ask that you do is pay attention to what it is we give you as future guidance. That is our best estimate of where we think the revenue numbers would be. You\u2019re still going to see some unusual relationships between futures and revenue for a few more quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Binetti </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I could just ask one more question on the gross margins, obviously the nuances of the gross margin we\u2019ve talked about a bit on this call, but as we\u2019ve visited over the last few years, the topic always comes up of when you guys can get back to the prior peak gross margins of just over 46%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about premiumization, and clearly you\u2019ve worked very hard on that line in the P&amp;L. Do you think at this point that the work you guys have done on product and on manufacturing and on the focus on pricing, we\u2019ve reset the bar long term for the grosses to be able to go over that level longer term? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We don\u2019t necessarily see there as being a ceiling on gross margin. As I said earlier in response to the pricing question, this is really about creating the equity in the brand and the product and how we distribute it that enables us to be premium and get paid for our work. And we believe that we have opportunities in terms of the revenue portion of the equation as we continue to drive that value equation behind the innovation and the brand. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the cost side, we\u2019ve talked about some of the things we\u2019re doing in the manufacturing space. We\u2019ve talked about just getting better and better at how we flow product, and we continue to see opportunities there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we don\u2019t see that previous peak as somehow a magical ceiling. As I said in my earlier remarks, it\u2019s a signpost on the journey, but we believe that we can continue to create that value in the margin equation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the final question is from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Tracy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess if I could touch on digital, and ecom, obviously a couple of quarters now of pretty significant acceleration. Maybe just touch on the consumer migration, the evolution of that channel overall. Obviously a massive opportunity, but how do you think about sort of expanding the market versus cannibalizing it and how you kind of maintain the relationships and balance with your wholesale partners?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good question. First of all, I\u2019d say that our commitment to DTC, our direct to consumer business, is a huge and critical part of the commitment we have to create a more premium presentation for our brands and our products and ultimately, giving our customers, consumers, a better experience all around. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that said, the world is changing. Consumer behavior and expectations are certainly changing. More people, it\u2019s no mystery to anybody here, are shopping online. They want products easy, they want it fast, they want to be able to customize and personalize, shop on their devices, and in an in-store setting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the relationship between those channels is really critical, whether it\u2019s Nike direct or with our retail partners. And that\u2019s really the focus of our marketplace development work is to really obsess how all the parts or channels actually work together, and work together in a way that really gives the consumer the best experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re focused on how do we address the needs and expectation of the consumer as we say they ultimately decide. So Nike, I think you\u2019ve seen, along with our retail partners, is expanding the market, and we\u2019re seeing more positive results all around. We think this is a win-win situation between Nike and our wholesale partners around the world, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Trevor mentioned, and we\u2019ve said this quite regularly, being a better retailer is making us a better company and a better wholesale partner. Nike.com, as bullish as we are, and as positive as the results have been, which are pretty spectacular, is still in the early stages. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re investing heavily. This is one of the bigger growth opportunities for us long term, big improvements in just how the consumer interacts with Nike online. Seamless cart experiences, making the transactions a lot easier. Actually, blurring the lines between transactioning online and in store. Supply chain improvements, improvements in ID. I could go on. Increased focus on mobile, very, very important for us. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the investment and the focus on this area will continue. And not as a separate, isolated part of Nike, but as an integrated part of our business and our categories. So I\u2019ll just say we\u2019re obviously quite bullish on this, and this is where the consumer\u2019s going, and this is where we\u2019ll be. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Kelley Hall</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, well, with that, we want to thank everyone for joining us. Happy holidays, everybody, and we\u2019ll talk to you next quarter.</p>", "twitContent": "$NKE - Nike's (NKE) CEO Mark Parkeron Q2 2015Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/2767395-nikes-nke-ceo-mark-parkeron-q2-2015results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "917", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17829", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17858", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/2767395-nikes-nke-ceo-mark-parkeron-q2-2015results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/2767395-nikes-nke-ceo-mark-parkeron-q2-2015results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
