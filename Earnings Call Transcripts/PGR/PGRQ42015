You may ask your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Glasspiegel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Glen. I was very encouraged by the last quarterly policy expectancy lengthening that you highlighted in the 10-K. How excited are you about that trend? Do you think that this is a breakout that suggests that Snapshot and other measures you\u2019re taking are working?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How am I excited about it? I\u2019ve been waiting for it for a long time, so I\u2019m actually pretty excited and I think the 5%, thereabouts that we\u2019re seeing in the trailing three is really quite indicative of what we hope will flow through. Lots of reasons for that, always hard to pin them down, but general excitement, absolutely yes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you take a look at some of our published materials, you\u2019ll see that the average rate that consumers have seen over the last year, regardless of channel, agency and direct, is about a 4%, which I would tell you to think more in those terms than specific rate changes. So 4%, which means a good number of our consumers are still seeing rate changes that are on the high side of that, so as we mature into the rate revisions that we\u2019re now becoming even more comfortable with and rate levels that we\u2019re becoming more comfortable with, I would look forward to seeing while continued positives, maybe not quite in the 4 range but a closer distribution or a tighter distribution around the average, so we will potentially benefit even more so on retention, not losing those higher end or the right-hand distribution around the average of 4 last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So really nice movement getting our new product into the marketplace, getting a rate level that we feel very comfortable with, maintaining that. You might remember we said at our IR meeting we had a strong preference for three 1% changes than one 3% change. All of that really is a big part of how we\u2019re trying to make sure that retention is front and center in all of our thinking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So nice to see it coming through. Frankly, I would tell you I\u2019ll be disappointed if that didn\u2019t continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Glasspiegel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Switching gears, Bill, the first quarter we\u2019ve seen sort of a stressful investment environment. Are you--maybe you can update us on how the fixed income has performed and the stress lines in? Are you taking this as an opportunity to increase risk, or are you de-risking on the portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll let Bill jump in there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill Cody</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. We are taking this as an opportunity to increase risk modestly. We\u2019ve increased the bid in the corporate exposure, a little bit in CMBS as well. Some areas we\u2019ve decreased risk, and that would be primarily munis because those have traded really tightly and very opposite to the rest of the fixed income markets, and also we\u2019ve reduced some of our high yield exposure because the high yield that we own has performed really, really well, to the point where it\u2019s trading at spreads similar to triple-B paper. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So for us, we\u2019re in a good position to take some risk, and we\u2019re finding some more compelling opportunities to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Glasspiegel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill Cody</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Performance-wise, we released our January numbers, which--our total returns. We\u2019ll release February in a couple weeks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Josh, your line is open. Go ahead with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Stirling</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, sorry - mute button. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the call. Would love to ask you a question about the status of Snapshot. Over the past six months or so, you guys have announced you\u2019ve been rolling out a new smartphone app, and I think at the last annual meeting you walked us through that you were iterating the pricing designed at discounts up front. I guess I was curious, just wanted a bit of an update on how many states you\u2019ve rolled these things out with, as well as more importantly what\u2019s been the consumer response, I guess both from the app, which feels like a different consumer interface and is kind of a question of adoption and comfort and just sort of more open-ended questions about that - you know, how consumers like the app and whether perhaps it\u2019s something we\u2019ll sell, and then separately on the discounts, what kind of lift have you seen from this? Is there impact in conversion rates and maybe on new sales? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we haven\u2019t done a little Snapshot update for a while, so let me see if I can hit all of those points and give you some flavor of what\u2019s going on. Starting into this year, we\u2019re still seeing our policies initiated with the Snapshot influence - discount, whatever it might be, to be faster than the rates of growth that you\u2019re seeing as we report on aggregate, so it\u2019s still our fastest growing sector. That remains true for a long time, but certainly even into January that was true. Starting to get a feel for what sort of mix of business is attainable. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019ll just give you a quick look here, not to confuse you with any numbers, but in our direct book of business, where we\u2019ve been able to offer Snapshot, and realistically there\u2019s only two states now, California and North Carolina, where we\u2019re not offering it, but over a period of time with a cohort where the Snapshot has been available, that cohort of business is now approximating about 40% of the direct business for places where it was available for some period of time. So think in terms of can the little train really take momentum? We\u2019re looking to sort of 40 to 50% in the direct channel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think I\u2019ve told you before, the acceptance in the direct channel far exceeds the agency channel, and with the new change that we made - it was very clear that we were hoping to see agency uptake on the--or the quotes include Snapshot with that discount [indiscernible] what I\u2019d call overly dramatic movement, but significant on the small base. Actually, we have some good news to report there. We actually introduced it into two, what I\u2019ll call higher average premiums states - Florida, Louisiana, and we\u2019re seeing the agent acceptance rates there, or the agent penetration into new quoting actually go up significantly, so probably approximating somewhere in the league of half to two-thirds the rate on our direct channel. So starting to make some traction there, and we\u2019re going to take a closer look. I think we did a better job of rolling that out to agents in those states who will take a close look at what we did well there, and make sure that we reinforce that in other places in the country. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So net-net, pretty good sized penetration in our direct book, and I don\u2019t want to project what the threshold might be as to overall penetration, but to think in terms of more than half of the book is not unreasonable based on what we\u2019ve experienced to date, and now we\u2019re starting to see opportunities where the agency business perhaps is, yes slower, but certainly starting to close some part of the gap, so good stuff there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to the app, we\u2019ve discussed that. I want to make it very clear that we\u2019ve had apps that have approximated in one way, shape or form the activity for some time. That\u2019s not been an issue. The issue is really making sure we had an app that we felt had the data integrity that really matched with the in-car dongle, and we\u2019ve got to the point where we actually have that application and very comfortable with it. There are all sorts of stories, some of which I\u2019m not as close to as others, but you need to be able to determine the difference between a train ride and a plane ride and a car ride. You need to know whether the person got in the left door or the right door, are they driving, are they passenger. All those sorts of things are actually very important to us, so it\u2019s easy enough to create an app that does part of the job, it\u2019s very hard to create an app that does the--or gives us the level of integrity that we\u2019d be comfortable swapping out for the information that we get from the dongle. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think we\u2019re there. Unfortunately, it\u2019s probably going to take us a little longer to get that into marketplace than we might like. There\u2019s a fair amount of work to do on the IT side, but certainly in \u201916 we expect to see that roll out, but it may be for all intents and purposes in large numbers later in the year. I think we\u2019ve probably mentioned we have a relationship with GM and OnStar that\u2019s been a little bit delayed, but we expect to be marketing that more actively in about the midyear time frame. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Snapshot, for lots of reasons, continues to be something very important to us, not only as an indicator of the sorts of things that we think we\u2019ll do more of in the future, but it\u2019s really taking hold and you all know the power of Snapshot relative to a rating variable, so ultimately when we start talking about penetration numbers that are really in the range of that 40, perhaps even 50%, it starts to make a difference in terms of segmentation. So we couldn\u2019t be more happy with what we see, I just don\u2019t know what the high water mark will be. But we\u2019re going to find out, and I hope it\u2019s really high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Stirling</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Glen, that\u2019s really helpful. I wonder if you could just touch briefly on your other big product development initiative, rolling out a combined homeowners product in the agency channel. Give us a sense of--I think you\u2019re live at least in a couple of states. It\u2019d be useful to have a little bit of color for how agency\u2019s responding, what kind of traction you\u2019re getting, and then maybe if you\u2019d be willing to walk us through what your goals are for the program as you look out over the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, and maybe I\u2019ll double team here with Tricia on a couple of points. Platinum is what we\u2019re talking about, and this is in short--I don\u2019t want to repeat things that were already written down, but in short it\u2019s the way that our ASI property business and Progressive come to the market, looking as if they are simply one. So let\u2019s not worry about the brand names, but the agents are seeing that as Platinum, we\u2019re in 12 states, we expect to be in an additional 22 this year, so that will give us some really nice penetration. Our goal is simple - our goal is to be a valid and almost significant choice inside the agency channel for those customers who want to bundle their auto and home together. We\u2019re comfortable if they start either way, but we really like the bundles. ASI is seeing about 50% now of their new quote volume being bundled, so we really--we\u2019re not going curtail in any way, shape or form mono line of either, but our real interest is in the bundle. We know what the effect of long-term retention there can be, so those things are great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our interest is making sure on the agency channel we offer a really viable option and a, as I put it, must-have solution for agents. We know we\u2019ve got a great auto product - I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any dispute on that. With ASI, we have a great homeowners product. We\u2019re going to work together to put that into a great package, and there is still work to be done so we don\u2019t think we\u2019re across the finish line. We probably never will get across the finish line, we can always make it better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the direct side, while ASI is not a big a player on the direct side, that\u2019s obviously a future option that we have for going forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tricia, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sales force and how we\u2019ve [indiscernible] the sales force to make sure that we get the message out as well as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tricia Griffith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah Josh, I think to what Glen said, before I\u2019d say that, we really--you know, first of all, the second half of last year, getting the product out, the AT product was really important to get that preferred business and then continue with stable rates. Then we had to have both an agent and a customer value proposition, so we know we needed to add more commissions for these preferred customers, match policy terms. Then as we started to talk with our ASI partners, we realized we really needed to combine sales forces and have very specific sales reps that work with our platinum agents. So we\u2019ve just done that recently and we\u2019re very excited about that, and we continue to--we have 12 states out. We have continued to understand where we\u2019re competitive, when we\u2019re not what we need to do, and I think agents understand that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We really want to make sure that we reward our agents not just with more commission but with preference, so when they choose us as number one or two--in fact, just this week John Sauerland and I are able to make some calls to agents that have reached some certain levels. We have hurdles to get over determining how many bundles you have in your agency, so while the data\u2019s in with 12 states, I would consider 2016 really the year of execution, understanding more and more about, again, how to get that low pure premium business and how to integrate the right sales force with these very specific agents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Stirling</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, well we\u2019ll stay tuned. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Just as a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. You may ask your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thank you. I guess first just a quick numbers question. When I was looking at your stat surplus for the end of the year and your leverage, normally obviously you\u2019re closer to three times. This year, you\u2019re at about 2.7, which I\u2019m assuming is the homeowners change, obviously. Just when I back that, if I kind of took your normal auto premiums divided by the 2.9 to 3 times and solved for the rest, home was coming in at about 1 times levered. Is that a good proxy? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, jump in here. You\u2019re right - the 2.7, a little bit influenced by the home. We would probably prefer to run the home business at more like 1.5, and I expect over time as these things, sometimes you get a little bit off, but think in terms of we\u2019re going to try to maximize on auto at about 3 to 1 if we possibly can, where we can - it never works out perfectly, and closer to a 1.5 on the homeowners business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s what I was wondering. Okay, great. Then on the reserves, I guess just first quickly on the January average development, normally--so I guess I\u2019m going back a tiny little bit here. There used to be big favor for leases in January due to sort of the catch-up from the prior December, and I recall you changed that process about three or four years to smooth that out. This January, we saw the lumpiness just in the other direction. Is it still the same process, or do we make a change in process back to the old way?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve got Gary here. I think the IB&amp;R was the process change coming off the table, so I\u2019ll let him take it away. But the unfavorable that you saw in December, I would--I don\u2019t want to be cavalier about it, but I would tell you, don\u2019t be too concerned about that. If that had been February over January, then it wouldn\u2019t be prior year. It just happens that it\u2019s the calendar close and therefore you see prior year development come through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we looked at our January development for \u201916, there was really nothing that was surprising over the prior year, so we\u2019re pretty comfortable with that,</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gary, why don\u2019t you put some more details there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Traicoff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. This is Gary Traicoff, Chief Actuary. To your point, about three to four years ago we did make a process change, and then the last few years looked fairly stable. What happened this past January was really due to more late reported claims that happened in December. They got reported in January, and if you think back to the end of December, we did have some storms come through, particularly in that last week or so. So in January, we just recognized more late reported losses, which was really the driver of the development in January.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, and Gary, while I have you, if I can clarify one other thing. I was looking in the K. On the reserves, it said our net reserve balance assumes that severity for acts in year 2015 over 2014 will be 4.2% higher for personal auto and 9.2% higher for commercial auto. I was trying to contrast that to earlier in the K when you talk about calendar year severity and give your frequency and severity stats, and the calendar year severity was, I guess, 3% for PD, 4% collision minus 2VI. If I sort of weight those, I get a very low single digit versus the 4.2 on the accident year. Is the difference between that low single digit and the 4.2 reserve releases, or is there some other way to interpret that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Traicoff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a great question. Related to that, when I think of calendar period severity, which is what the low numbers you were talking about, our calendar period severity that came through in the year was fairly low, particularly in VI, it was actually negative. That was really the driver of why our reserves developed so favorably in 2015. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When we think ahead and going forward, we don\u2019t anticipate long-term severity will continue to be negative like that, so if we look at what we actually have booked in our reserving models, we are anticipating roughly a 4% severity going forward on liability. Now, that will include VI, PD, et cetera, so if you do all those cuts by state and by line, most of them are in the 2 to 6% range, but overall it rolls up to about 4. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When I look at commercial lines, it is about a 9%. Some of that, though, relates to mix changes in the business marketing targets we have, so if you normalize for that, think of it probably closer to a 6% range or so, which was actually fairly consistent with our commercial line severity in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, and do you have something similar for that where the accident year frequency wasn\u2019t just used? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Traicoff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We did not report anything in there for accident year frequency. Typically though, calendar year and accident year frequencies are fairly well aligned. You\u2019re not going to have as much of a disconnect as you might have on the severity side, particularly with the VI and the long-tailed coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Just a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. You may ask your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. I guess back on the product, a couple of quick questions here. First, how PLEs looking so far with respect to the customers you\u2019re getting, and then on that also, I\u2019m just wondering, Glen, is there an opportunity here, given the consolidation we\u2019ve seen in the mass affluent market, that you could potentially go after that right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brian, could you just give me the second part of the question again, the consolidation piece?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry, yeah. With what we\u2019ve seen this far with the consolidation in the high net worth or mass affluent market from a homeowners perspective, is there an opportunity for you guys to really go after that, because I know agents are asking for new carriers there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Let me take that first. I think we\u2019ve shown you at some prior IR meetings, and we\u2019re more than willing to show you as we get more and more information, that the bundled customer really does give us that notion of a meaningful - and I\u2019m going to stress that, a meaningful extension on our life expectancy. In my shareholders letter, I started to use some language that I think will become more common inside Progressive, moving away from policy life expectancy to customer life expectancy. I think you get that - it\u2019s really we are looking to at least a piece of our business, and I stress that - we\u2019ll still always do the pieces that we do well, a piece of our business being customers that actually stay with us in a reasonably long period of time--or actually not a reasonably long period, a very long period of time, and have multiple products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So a way to think about that, so yes, we are seeing--yes, that was our hypothesis, yes, we\u2019re seeing it, and the data is solid and meaningful. I think quite frankly, we might even be understating the customer life expectancy yet, because we haven\u2019t seen that kind of customer for a long period of time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Something just internally, and this is just to give you a little bit of a mindset of how we think, we\u2019re starting to, and this is, I would say, something that 30 years ago certainly was not on our radar screen, what percentage of our customers have been with us for more than 10 years. Now, we have a meaningful double-digit, let\u2019s say around 15% of our customers that have been with us for more than 10 years. That wouldn\u2019t be a number that would impress USAA or State Farm, I\u2019m sure, but relative to the repositioning of Progressive, that\u2019s a number that\u2019s very important, and the type of customers that we\u2019re seeing go into that state of decade and decade-plus customers are the bundled customers, so nice stuff there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to your question on the high net worth, I\u2019m going to be very frank. We\u2019ve got a big agenda in front of us and we\u2019re going to probably play in something below the high net worth customer, just put it out on the table exactly that way. That doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t make some phone calls and have other people\u2019s product to sell to those high net worth customers, at least on the home side, but that\u2019s probably not the focus that we\u2019re going to add to our property business anytime in the immediate future, given the very large market opportunity there is for us that we feel very comfortable realizing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks. Just one other one. Any changes that we could think about with respect to your reinsurance program?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go through the reinsurance renewal. Trevor\u2019s actually here, but in the June-July type time frame and--John, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, but no, I expect that we will take reinsurance with our property business very, very similar to the way that we have taken it in the past, at least for the excess layers. We may and likely will reassess some small part of a quota share. That really isn\u2019t necessary from our perspective going forward, but in terms of the layers, we\u2019re not looking to take higher in risk any greater than we have taken in the past, or ASI has taken in the past, and that was never the objective. The objective is to get more customers in the door. We\u2019ll take a reasonable amount of risk, but we feel very good about the amount of risk we\u2019re taking and don\u2019t intend to extend that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for the answers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Just a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. You may ask your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, good morning. I have a few questions just to understand your reporting. Let me use one example. So you have in the K, there are direct renewal application changes that were 5%, I think, for the year. In earlier quarters, it\u2019s 7%, 7%, 8%, so should we look at that 5% as just a modest dip from the 8%, or is there a bigger dip in the fourth quarter that gets us full year to 5?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Want to take that, John?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Sauerland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, I can take that. Recognize we do have a calendar year that in some years has more weeks than in others, so in last December of \u201914, you might recall we had an extra week. We put that in a December release for you, so. In that release, I think we also normalized the premium for the month for you to give better perspective there. I would not interpret that at all to be a dip in renewals. The PLE is what you should be looking at to understand trends in terms of customer retention, and as we discussed earlier, we\u2019re seeing good changes there. I think you\u2019re just seeing a reporting anomaly, nothing material.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that helps a lot. Thanks for clarifying. Second, if we look at the property side, so if I\u2019m doing the math right, you acquired $220 million of reserves and released a little bit more than 30. Is that sort of 15% a good representation of ASI\u2019s reserving philosophy?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I\u2019m going to sort of answer that a little bit more generically. One of the things that I am delighted about in the first nine months of being together is that we feel, and I think ASI feels that we have some skills to offer, and clearly they have product and skills to offer as well. But one of the places that we were able to actually dig in together is on the reserving side, and we now have an actuary that has been on our actuarial staff working directly for Trevor, the CFO of ASI, but also having very direct line or dotted line, whatever we want to call it, as an integral part of our reserving group. During the course of that nine months, we applied some different techniques, we looked at data a little bit more specifically to ASI versus industry data that had been done before. There was no right or wrong, there was just we\u2019re digging in, in a way that perhaps is a little bit more intense, a little more reflective of the way Progressive has done reserving. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In this particular case, it turned out we had some releases. It could have been the other way. We would have adjusted either way, but I would tell you that the reflection of the releases this time is a little bit more from a highly intense review, overlaying some models, overlaying some techniques, looking at data, looking at it more frequently, and I expect going forward - obviously I cannot guarantee anything, but what I expect going forward is we\u2019ll be much more on a glide path of the kind of approaches that we take traditionally with our auto business, and I suspect the volatility will reduce. So probably one-time volatility that is reflective of that process, but frankly it\u2019s a great opportunity for us to really work together in taking a look. I have to say it\u2019s always nicer that it\u2019s a release, not an add, but frankly I feel much better that we\u2019ve had the deep study and everybody is very comfortable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Just a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks and good morning. Now that you\u2019ve gone through the year-end 2015 process, I just wanted to get your updated views on why you feel Progressive is not being impacted nearly as much on the personal auto side as a result of increased miles driven translating into worse claims frequency trends, like we\u2019re seeing for essentially the rest of the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jay, I might challenge the right of the industry piece there a little bit. Notwithstanding that frequency was up, we\u2019re reporting sort of across the board 2, 2.5. I don\u2019t think that is dramatically different than the PCI reporting part of the industry. Fully note that there were a couple of very large and very notable competitors who know perfectly well how to calculate frequency, they reported high numbers, and that\u2019s just a fact. I can\u2019t necessarily know, other than at least in one case probably a mix adjustment that really needed to be made to sort of normalize those numbers, but I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re the anomaly on that relative to the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to--but to be fair, any time - and I mean this sincerely - any time we see anybody else seeing something that we\u2019re not seeing, trust me, the radar just goes off like crazy and we make sure that we\u2019re not the ones waiting too long to see that kind of effect. But as it\u2019s played through from an order perspective, we really didn\u2019t see a great deal in frequency. We didn\u2019t see any major trends. We saw it up a little bit in the third quarter, but for the most part that 2, 2.5, not bad. Now, remember systemically long term, we think maybe frequency is headed for a reduction for lots of reasons with vehicle technology. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Miles driven, no question that that would be the usual suspect for increase in frequency, and to the extent we didn\u2019t see it as much as some others, I would also tell you that our most recent reporting on mileage increase related clearly to gas prices, we\u2019re starting to see the second half of \u201915--or we did see the second half of \u201915 be a lot less dramatic of an increase over the prior year than the first half of \u201915. Our most recent data points might suggest that we have hit sort of the threshold of miles to be driven. I think we\u2019d be better off waiting to the spring and summer to see if we get another spring and summer effect, but for the most part, the more recent data points we\u2019ve seen, up to and including January since we get very real-time data, is that \u201916 mileage is not dramatic, or not even different from \u201915 mileage, and we\u2019re seeing that even in the last data points of \u201915 over \u201914.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the incremental, yes, there was incremental first half of \u201915 that was very measurable, quite notable, 3 to 5% on a month-to-month basis, but we\u2019re starting to see that level out. We still see in the mix of miles driven a little shift, about a 1% shift still to trips over 15 miles. We\u2019re not seeing anything dramatic in seasonally adjusted braking rates, probably not a statistic most other companies talk about, but something that we\u2019re particularly interested in. So net-net, the gas price change may have played its way through. I\u2019m going to say that with some ability to retract my statement next time we talk in May or whatever, so stay tuned. But I would just correct that maybe the rest of the industry didn\u2019t see the frequency quite as a high as perhaps an Allstate and Geico, I think are the two that come to mind when we see that, and certainly the two that took rate that was more reflective of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Glen, all the miles driven trends you were just talking about, that\u2019s based on Progressive\u2019s own data? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we use the Snapshot population to see if we can get--we\u2019re kind of nutty about this. We even look at it sort of daily, weekly, whatever frequency we can, because these are the sorts of things that for years we\u2019ve reported even to you, we don\u2019t always know what drives frequency. You don\u2019t always know what drives severity. Well, now we actually do have at least one proxy for frequency, and miles driven is something we can measure. So it\u2019s only a piece of the puzzle, but we\u2019re pretty obsessed with trying to get it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can imagine that. The only other thing I wanted to touch base on with regard to what some large writers of the industry and personal auto are seeing with regard to deteriorating margins, so if the frequency impact that Progressive is seeing is not inconsistent with that of the industry, why do you feel that Progressive\u2019s personal auto margins haven\u2019t been really impacted at all?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Glen Renwick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s probably a longer story, but let me suggest to you that - and we\u2019ve done this on many, many calls, I\u2019ve always said when we see situations that make us believe that rates will go up, we tend to take it early. It wasn\u2019t that many years ago that we took, and talking in aggregates is not always the best thing but it might work for this, we took rates up and frankly some of the trends didn\u2019t materialize to the degree that we thought. Our penalty there is that we actually grow a little slower with healthy margins. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, in more recent times we\u2019ve gotten to a rate level that we thought was appropriate, and perhaps others weren\u2019t quite at that level and therefore needed to take their rates up more. So the starting point matters, and that was sort of my point before. I like to think that we\u2019re trying to ride the crest of the breaking wave. We want to stay on the crest all the time. When you fall over the crest and your margins start to deteriorate, typically that\u2019s associated with a big hammer of rate, and we all know the implications of that to retention, to NPS, and to growth. The trick for us is really staying on that crest and, as I mentioned earlier, as opposed to looking at rate take by rate filings, which you could look at a premium-weighted adjusted basis, you\u2019ll see that the industry is about 2.5 to 3.5 last year, some exceptions to that for sure on the high side and low side. But I would always draw your attention to sort of what is the realized average premium, and you see in our case that was about 4% in both channels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have ways that I\u2019m not going to get into in great detail of making sure that we build in some trend into our rating factors as well, so that doesn\u2019t always come through in the published rate changes. So our objective is really to stay on that crest of the wave, and answering your question, it depends on the starting point, so we were not inadequate and didn\u2019t need to take a big rate increase, and we actually have been taking small bites of the apple and we\u2019re going to keep taking bites of the apple. My expectation is in the first quarter of this year, we\u2019ll take about probably the better part of a point, at least in our direct channel, and maybe close to that in our agency channel, so we\u2019ll always take that kind of a rate. I\u2019m not going to speculate for the whole year, but it might be sort of slightly below the 4%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ian asked the question before about severities, and while we did have the fortuitous situation of severities going down and therefore we could release reserves based on the negative severity trends we saw, I will tell you one of the first lessons I ever learned in this business was people don\u2019t get less expensive to fix, so we certainly don\u2019t plan negative trends into our pricing indications, and we\u2019re much more likely to reflect the kinds of numbers that Gary talked about going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So long way of saying, but our job is to stay on the crest of the wave, and the good news is that we are not currently in the position of taking a significant hammer to our rates, or haven\u2019t had to for some time, and if we can stay on that crest of the wave without falling over by taking small bites of the apple, that\u2019s our objective and that produces some very nice outcomes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Julia Hornack</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Julia. I just want to remind everyone that if you\u2019d like to ask a question, you may press star, one on your touchtone phone. While we wait to see if anyone else is calling in or has a question, I just wanted to make a quick housekeeping announcement, which is that for those of you who would like to join us at our investor day this year, we will be holding it on the afternoon of Thursday, October 6 in Mayfield Village, Ohio.
