[Operator Instructions] Just as a brief reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.</p> <p>And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Viola, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Michael Viola</strong></p> <p>Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. I\u2019m Mike Viola, Head of Investor Relations for AT&amp;T. And joining me on the call today is Randall Stephenson, AT&amp;T\u2019s Chairman and CEO; and John Stephens, AT&amp;T\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.

And then, we will follow that up with a Q&amp;A session.</p> <p>Before we begin, I want to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments today may be forward-looking. As such, they\u2019re subject to risks and uncertainties, results may differ materially and additional information is available on the Investor Relations website.</p> <p>I also want to remind you that we\u2019re in the quiet period for<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> the FCC Spectrum Auction 103, so we can\u2019t address any questions about that today.

And one more item before I turn it over to Randall, we\u2019ve scheduled our WarnerMedia Day for the afternoon<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> of October 29 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. We will discuss more details on the new streaming service, HBO Max, and more details will come, but go ahead and mark your calendars.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Randall Stephenson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Randall Stephenson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mike. Good morning. The headline of the second quarter and the first half of the year is we\u2019re hitting each of our commitments we made for 2019, and you can see those on Slide 3. I\u2019ll start with our new leveraging plans, which are right on track. Since we close the merger last June, net debt is down $18 billion. We expect to further reduce net debt about another $12 billion in the second half of the year, and that should get us to a 2.5 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA range by year-end. And to the extent that we can overachieve on that objective, you can expect we\u2019ll take a hard look at allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wireless is about half of our overall EBITDA and it continues to fire on all cylinders. Last quarter, we grew revenues, EBITDA, and phone subscribers both postpaid and prepaid. Wireless service revenues were up 2.4% in the second quarter and we\u2019re continuing to see the payoff on our investments with a world-class network.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our wireless network has been named fastest, the best and the most reliable by independent testing services. FirstNet continues to be the driver of our network performance as well as our 5G leadership. And at the end of the quarter, we were about 60% complete with our FirstNet coverage, ahead of plan. And we are now targeting 70% completion by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our FirstNet build is accelerating our 5G deployment, as we deployed FirstNet, we\u2019re installing hardware that can be upgraded to 5G with a simple software release. As a result, we\u2019re on track for nationwide 5G coverage by the first half of 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to WarnerMedia, there was another strong quarter, merger synergies remain on track and we had solid operating income growth across all three business units. This was a record year, 191 Primetime Emmy nominations for WarnerMedia and HBO alone scored 137 nominations. That was the most in its history. So, what was the result of all of this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had very strong HBO digital subscriber growth in the quarter, and we\u2019re setup really well for the second half of the year. Bottom line, HBO\u2019s stepped up investment in content is working. And this will be critical as we launched HBO Max next spring. And as Mike mentioned, we look forward to share a more about HBO Max in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Entertainment Group continues to make solid progress, we didn\u2019t just stabilize EBITDA, we actually grew it by 1.1% in the quarter. Later this summer, we\u2019ll beta launch AT&amp;T TV in a few markets, that\u2019s our live TV service over broadband. We have some really high expectations for this product, and we\u2019re going to learn from the pilot, and then we\u2019ll expand to more cities as we go to the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">IP broadband revenue growth remain strong, we continue to see a solid growth in our AT&amp;T Fiber product. That product now reaches about 14 million customer locations or 22 million when you include businesses. So, all in all solid, steady progress against the commitments we made coming into the year. And appealing even more confident that we\u2019re going to meet or exceed each of those commitments for the full year. In fact, this morning, we\u2019ve raised our free cash flow guidance for 2019 to the $28 billion range, that\u2019s up $2 billion and we\u2019ve reaffirmed all of our other guidance for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So now for more detail on the quarter, I\u2019m going to turn this over to John, and he\u2019ll take you through the results. So, John?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Stephens</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Randall, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with our financial summary on Slide 5. As Randall mentioned, we\u2019re on track with all our financial targets. And in many areas, we\u2019re ahead of plan. Adjusted EPS was $0.89 in the quarter, including $0.02 impact from a higher effective tax rate. We continue to expect low-single-digit growth for the full year, as we are set up for a solid second half of the year performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We grew revenue both on a reported and pro forma basis in the quarter. In fact, all segments are growing on a constant currency basis. Adjusted operating margin was up 90 basis points with the addition of WarnerMedia, strong growth in Mobility, and continued improvement in our Entertainment Group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our cash flows were very strong on the quarter. Let\u2019s look at this on Slide 6. Cash from operations came in strong at $14.3 billion, that\u2019s up 40% and free cash flow was a record $8.8 billion. The addition of WarnerMedia operations made and impact, as did adding their receivables to our securitization efforts. The securitization lifted free cash flow by $2.6 billion. Our ability to generate cash continues to be impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve generated $29 billion in free cash flow or about $4 a share. With the benefit of our securitization efforts, we have confidence to raise our free cash flow guidance for the full year to the $28 billion range. Our strong cash position also allows us to continue to invest at industry leading levels. CapEx was $5.5 billion and total capital investment was $6.5 billion, when you include the $1 billion of payments for prior vendor financing activity. And we reduced net debt by $6.8 billion in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me speak more to deleveraging on Slide 7. We paid-off $18 billion in debt since we closed the merger, and we ended the quarter with our adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio at just under 2.7 times. This is down from 3 times leverage ratio, when we close the deal. And we\u2019re squarely on track to hit our year-end target of being in the 2.5 times range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year-to-date, we\u2019ve reduced net debt by nearly $9 billion, that includes about $7 billion from free cash flow and nearly $4 billion in asset monetizations, offset by about $2 billion of vendor payments and other purchases of assets. And these sales have come from assets that contribute no EBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at the remainder of the year, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll hit our year-end leverage target. To the extent, we can overachieve with that target you can expect will take a hard look at allocating capital to share buybacks in the back half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now look at our segment operating results starting with our Communications segment on Slide 8. The story of our Communications segments this quarter is stable revenue [Technical Difficulty] EBITDA and margin growth, while adding phone subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Entertainment Group is delivering EBITDA growth. And Business Wireline revenue trends improved in the quarter, thanks to strength in strategic and managed services and about $125 million from IP licensing. But even without those licensing proceeds, Business Wireline revenue trends were the best that we\u2019ve seen in years. And when you factor in strong Business Wireless performance, our Business Solutions revenue grew 2.3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the cost side between, the team is doing great work in controlling content, promotions and other operating costs. Solid cost management was evident throughout the business, especially in our Entertainment and Business Wireline units.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me give you some more details starting with Mobility on Slide 9. Our Mobility business continues to perform very well. Service revenues grew by 2.4%, EBITDA growth was even higher at 3.1% and EBITDA margins expanded by 80 basis points with service margins of 56.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had a strong quarter with 355,000 phone net adds, including 72,000 postpaid and 283,000 prepaid. And we added 388,000 smartphones in the quarter further strengthening our customer base. Postpaid phone trend was up slightly to 0.86%, but was down sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And at the same time, our prepaid business, especially Cricket continues to perform at strong consistent levels. Prepaid revenues were up nearly 10%, we had our 18th consecutive quarter of phone growth, and churn hit an all-time low at both cricket and AT&amp;T prepaid. With the network leadership and FirstNet expansion that Randall talked about earlier, we\u2019re confident that our wireless business will get even stronger as we evolve to 5G. In short, our network investments particularly our spectrum deployment are paying off, and we\u2019re not done yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s go on to our Entertainment Group results on Slide 10. Our focus on long-term customer value continues to impact our Entertainment Group. EBITDA grew both year-over-year and sequentially. This was the second straight quarter of EBITDA growth. Year-to-date EBITDA was up about 4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expense reduction outpaced revenue declines, setting the stage for EBITDA growth. Broadband revenue growth helped us as well as continued growth in video ARPUs. The number of premium TV customers on the two-year price lock declined by more than 600,000 in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Video subscriber numbers were in line with what we said to expect for the quarter. Premium declined 778,000 and DIRECTV NOW declined 168,000. And as Randall mentioned earlier, later the summer, we\u2019ll begin piloting AT&amp;T TV, our thin client broadband TV product, the best important milestone with our fiber deployment reaching $14 million customer locations, and satisfying our fiber build commitments. This will be an important driver of growth going forward. In fact, we had more than 300,000 AT&amp;T fiber net adds in the quarter, and IP broadband revenue grew by 6.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect AT&amp;T fiber penetration to grow as the service matures. Bottom line, we remain comfortable that we\u2019ll meet or exceed our Entertainment Group EBITDA that target for the full year. And lay the groundwork for continued stability beyond 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s move to WarnerMedias\u2019 results, which are on Slide 11. WarnerMedia continues to be free cash flow accretive. Our expense management with merger-related synergies are on track. We expect to hit a $700 million run rate by the end of this year. And HBO Max is slated to launch next spring. Overall, WarnerMedia had another strong quarter with 5.5% revenue growth and solid operating income growth. HBO revenues grew, thanks to strong content sales, driven by home entertainment and international licensing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turner revenues were up about 2% on subscription revenue growth, and this includes the advertising impact of not having the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four championship this year. It will be back on Turner next year. And at Warner Bros., theatrical revenues increased due to home entertainment games and a highly successful release of Mortal Kombat 11, which drove game revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, Mike, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Viola</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we\u2019re ready for the Q&amp;A instructions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And looks like first, we have the line of John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Hodulik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you. Maybe some questions on the Entertainment segment. And specifically, on the video subs. John, you said you\u2019ve got about another 1 million subs left on the promotions. When did those promotions expire? And maybe if you could comment a little bit on the programming disputes you\u2019re having with CBS and Nexstar. One, is this \u2013 is expectations for resolution there driving some of the belief and continued growth in EBITDA in that segment? And then, how do you expect that to impact the sub trends as we look into the second half of the year? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, John. It\u2019s Randall. I\u2019ll take the carriage disputes that are going on with CBS and Nexstar first, and I\u2019ll hand it to John, let him just kind of reconcile the subscriber numbers for you. As everybody probably knows, CBS has pulled their signal off DIRECTV as has Nexstar. And there are two very different situations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On CBS, it\u2019s kind of an interesting situation. The bid asked candidly is not that wide. But it\u2019s kind of an interesting dynamic with them. We sent \u2013 that was a reasonable fair offer over five days ago, and it\u2019s been Cricket\u2019s. We haven\u2019t heard anything, haven\u2019t yet had a response to the offer. When you\u2019re as close as we are, we find a little interesting that we\u2019re still sitting here dark and not having interaction with CBS. I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re probably distracted with other negotiations right now, but I don\u2019t know.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nexstar, it\u2019s a very different situation. Nexstar, as you know basically their product is broadcast, the four big broadcast stations free-over-the-air content, I might point out, and their opening bid in the negotiations like a 100% increase. And not only was it a 100% increase, but the assets that they\u2019re trying to acquire that they don\u2019t yet own yet. They were asking for a rather significant increase on assets they don\u2019t own. So, it began with kind of a nonstarter. They\u2019ve pulled their signal and gone dark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now the spread is they\u2019re asking for a 50% increase on broadcast channels that again are free over the air. And so that one may take longer, but we\u2019ll just have to be a resolute on this one. We\u2019re just not going to impose those kind of price increases on our customers. And interestingly enough, unlike other times we have gone through these type of blackouts where companies have pulled their signal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our customers and world of streaming are finding other ways to access this content. And so, there\u2019s other technologies, these technologies can even flow right into the programming guide in our DIRECTV lineup and some customers are at a pretty significant rate finding other ways of getting to that content, so that one could take a while. CBS, I\u2019m optimistic, but hopefully we\u2019re just going to back to the table and get this closed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, taking that forward, we\u2019ve got about a 1 million customers left, as I mentioned on these price locks, and those price locks expire in the fourth quarter. Pretty much ratably I\u2019d say throughout the second half of the year. But in November, as they closed out, and we expect to have through the process by the end of this year, so we\u2019d expect to continue to see some of the impacts of getting to this value based long-term customer value approach that we\u2019ve taken on those customers and continue to see some of the same trends we\u2019ve seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, we have \u2013 as you\u2019ve seen the EBITDA grow and the performance of the business being really solid, certainly stable, but solid in my mind. You can see that; we believe that this value of customer long-term value customer approach is working. So, on the intake side, we\u2019re going to continue to file that, and that will also continue to lead us to some working through the rest of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But that being said, we\u2019re encouraged about our early insights in the AT&amp;T TV. We\u2019re encouraged about the ability to get out of the beta, learn from it, and take it forward the rest of this year. So, when I look at 2020, and we\u2019ve been through the two year price locks, we\u2019ve been through a full year of adding a long-term value based customer and we have the potential to use AT&amp;T TV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have more optimistic expectations for 2020 that gives us the basis to believe that our margins will continue to be stable next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just most importantly, what John just went through is, as we come out of back end of 2019 and the customer base is cleaned up. We will have a customer base that is going to be perfectly suited for HBO Max. And we really had a really strong second quarter with HBO. And I got to tell you what we saw on HBO in the second quarter, particularly on the digital subscriptions that were added, we\u2019re gaining more and more confidence that this DIRECTV base, as we come out of 2019 is going to be ideally suited for driving HBO, HBO Max penetration as we launch that next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Hodulik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot, gentlemen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the question, John. We\u2019ll take the next question, operator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next in queue, we\u2019ll go to the line of Phil Cusick with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Cusick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Thanks. Following up there, you\u2019ve given through the second quarter some thoughts about typical seasonality in video losses in 2Q versus 1Q, and it came through around that 100,000. How do you think about typical video losses in 3Q versus 2Q? And should we expect a continued sort of subdued level of promotion in video until you get to the wider AT&amp;T TV launch?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, Phil. I think, you should expect \u2013 as you call it subdued or what we call at the long-term value focus promotional activity, I think that\u2019s right. You should expect that. We have some normal summer activity with video, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to change. What I would tell you though is the balancing of that with the same number of customers, the amount of customers getting off these two-year price locks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Putting that together, what I\u2019m trying to say is, we\u2019d expect this level of losses to continue and are predicting what they are, but we need to get through this 1 million customers base and some of the other, if you will, less the value-conscious-focused promotions that we\u2019ve done in prior years. We need to get through those that will take us through the end of the year to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The positive side of that is, I don\u2019t know what AT&amp;T TV is going to do for us. I think, it\u2019s going to be a focus of real results in 2020, because we\u2019re going to roll it out later this quarter and then we\u2019ll test it. But you can be assured, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on this long-term value of the customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next up in queue, we have the line of Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simon Flannery</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much. Turning to the balance sheet on the buybacks, can you help us think about, how you\u2019re going to balance buybacks versus continued deleveraging once you get to the 2.5, where do you \u2013 where would you like to end up on the balance sheet and how are you going to divide your free cash flow between the two?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then if you could update us on the $6 billion to $8 billion of net asset sales, you\u2019ve obviously sold almost $4 billion already. But where do you see that trending at this point? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Simon, I want to take the asset sales first. Feel really good about where we\u2019re at. The \u2013 and I bucket them \u2013 I put them in two buckets. One is a straight asset sales, Hulu and Hudson Yards, and that was the $4 billion. But we\u2019ve also done a whole collection of other working capital impacts just like the WarnerMedia securitizations, a whole collection of that kind of activity. So, we feel really good where we\u2019re at.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to the asset sales, we\u2019re \u2013 I think, it\u2019s public knowledge that we\u2019re out there selling our collection of about 1,300 U.S. cell towers that we still have, we still own. We have a whole collection over a 1,000 cell towers in Mexico. We probably have 250 parcels of real estate with a couple of $100 million in the contract. We have an equity investment in the company called CME and their independent board is reviewing their strategic alternatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we\u2019ve got a whole collection of things that\u2019s not all of them, but we\u2019ve got a whole collection of things that gives us confidence in meeting that $6 billion to $8 billion range, and hopefully doing very well with regard to that $6 billion to $8 billion target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019ll remind you that that\u2019s on a net basis, too, so we\u2019re expecting to cover the investment we made in millimeter wave this year in the 24 auctions. So, the $6 billion to $8 billion target is going to include being to pay for that with the proceeds. We just got a lot of opportunities, we feel good about it, and I\u2019ll leave that with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to the balance sheet, I think, if you can think about as we talked about after \u2013 the fourth year after the close of the deal. We look to be \u2013 I\u2019d expect, we\u2019d be somewhere around the 2.0 range or below that gives us great flexibility to pay down debt and take advantage of what now is a higher cash cost of equity capital than the cash cost of our debt capital. So, when you look at out of very methodical basis, right now, the cash flows of the overall operation on an after dividend basis can be enhanced by shifting some of your focus from debt repayment to buyback.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I want to make sure, we stay focused on the fact that we\u2019re going to achieve, we expect to achieve our guidance. And we\u2019ll get there and that is our focus \u2013 primary focus right now to make sure we look [ph] that. We\u2019re well on track, we feel good. I think you can tell that just by the fact that we just raised our guidance on free cash flow. But that\u2019s how we think about it. So, these are historically low interest rate environment, and operating at these levels has been something we can very reasonably do, periodically we do and feel very comfortable about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Simon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next up in queue, we have the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Barden</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one would be it\u2019s been a while since the Business Wireline side surprised to the upside, and I think that you guys have been trying to kind of just maintain it, but is there something structural or competitively that has evolved it, might be \u2013 this might be the first data point in the trend? Or is it more of an anomaly?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the second question, John Stephens, would be on the cash flow guide. Could you kind of parse down the increase in the free cash flow guidance? Is it related to lower CapEx, as you shift CapEx to vendor financing? Or is it related to the working capital benefits from the WarnerMedia asset sale or other things kind of that are going to come through the year? It\u2019d just be helpful to kind of get a picture of that. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, they could \u2013 let me take that free cash flow one first. And quite frankly, we\u2019re at the $26 billion range, feel very good about that. We did $2.6 billion securitization that we told you about. And quite frankly some would suggest that raising the guidance to $28 billion could have been raised even higher number than the $28 billion range. But quite frankly, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the network, our FirstNet team, our network team is [putting for sales] [ph] quite frankly ahead of schedule. They\u2019re being really efficient. But if they need more capital, I want to have the flexibility to do that and still meet what we\u2019re \u2013 what our guidance is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If we can get software releases out quicker with regard to 5G, and put those in place, I want to retain the flexibility to do that. So quite frankly, the raise in guidance is something that\u2019s very reasonable to achieve, and feel good about it. And yet retains flexibility for us. So, I understand the reason for your question, but we have retained some flexibility in this to make sure that if we can continue to build at this \u2013 the 60% achievement level that we\u2019re at is nine months ahead of schedule. If we can keep doing this and the impacts of that overall wireless business are really showing up at lower churn in customer. We\u2019ve had a 1 million voice customers in the last year, 355,000 just in last quarter. So, feel really good about what it\u2019s doing. So, I want to be ready to support those really quality efforts, that\u2019s that aspect of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the B2B front, Dave. This is Randall. Look, U.S. business is pretty healthy, U.S. business is doing very, very strong. And we\u2019re now into since tax reform, I think, like our six quarter of really healthy fixed investment for businesses. And that tracks really, really well with what we do. And it\u2019s been a little soft in the last quarter or two with the China trade discussions. The administration didn\u2019t like to \u2013 for us to talk about that, but look business has pulled in and best with the last quarter or so as a result of the trade uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But with all that said, it\u2019s been six quarters of pretty robust increase in business fixed investment and that tracks very well with us. Second is pricing has been pretty rational in this industry, and especially as we\u2019ve worked off a lot of those whole legacy products, we had this incredible pricing pressure. We\u2019re now in the market. What\u2019s growing are the new IP type services. And the pricing there in the marketplace has been pretty reasonable and stable, and the new products sets are doing well. You saw special service as we call them, but I think those were up 6% plus for the quarter, which is a really nice healthy growth rate for those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then we had some IP sales in the quarter, and that profit up a little bit. So \u2013 but even without that, the trends are really, really strong here. We feel good \u2013 we feel about as positive on this segment as we have in quite some time. And as businesses keep investing, we\u2019ll continue to be really bullish on this segment. And the IP sales by the way, I mean, I know those are come in big blocks, but they\u2019re not one time. We\u2019ve had these in the past had a couple in this quarter, and we\u2019ll have probably, I suspect, more in the future that\u2019s become a nice little opportunity for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, we haven\u2019t even talked about the Microsoft and the IBM deals that were announced just recently. And those are not inconsequential deals. Those have multifaceted implications. And predominantly, those deals addressed a particular area. The biggest cost item on AT&amp;T\u2019s P&amp;L are we call it the factory costs. But it\u2019s the network and the IT costs, the big iron costs. And as you have seen over the last few years, we have very consistently with all the activity in the network going on, we have very consistently driven those cost levels down on an absolute basis, 8%, 9%, 10% year-over-year very consistently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re kind of getting to a place where it\u2019s hard to continue getting those type of productivity increases. What we\u2019re doing with both IBM and Microsoft is leveraging their capabilities in large scale cloud deployments. And they\u2019re taking over a lot of applications for AT&amp;T, moving those to the cloud. And what is going to do is allow us to continue at this type of cost reduction curve on the network and IT side of the house, and continue that momentum there. In addition, we are securing revenue opportunities with each of those companies, and actually have go-to-market strategies. That will allow us to continue to keep the momentum you\u2019re seeing on the wireline revenue side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, all in all, I would tell you, we\u2019re relatively bullish on the B2B side of the house, and hopeful that we continue to have economic growth, the trade situation doesn\u2019t become a distraction for businesses that we can continue and improve on this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Dave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Take the next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next up, we have the line of Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brett Feldman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking the question. For the last few quarters, we\u2019ve seen a steady execution in the wireless business, and that\u2019s been without being fully deployed on FirstNet without really having had a chance to do a lot yet with 5G. But over the next year, both of those initiatives are going to be much more significantly deployed. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about your go-to-market in Mobility and whether you think over the next few quarters, there\u2019s an opportunity to maybe step on the gas a bit more? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Thanks, Brett. This is Randall, again. Yeah, look the wireless side of the house, we are feeling more and more confident every day as we execute through the network strategy in the FirstNet strategy. And as you think about growth in the future, you hit on the key elements. FirstNet is just in its infancy, and we have a few hundred subscribers that have moved to FirstNet. The first responder community is a rather large market, and it\u2019s a market where we come into it with very small share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, our opportunity to grow share as we build out this First Responder Network is quite significant, and you\u2019re starting to see that play itself out. But that just as importantly is as we build out the FirstNet network, we\u2019re moving into markets where we have had a pretty thin presence in the past. These are rural communities. And as we move into these communities, we are standing up brand new distribution in many communities. And everybody on this call, who\u2019s followed this business for a while knows what the penetration numbers look like when a new entrant comes into a community.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first market share goes quick. It comes to you quick; we\u2019re starting to see that as we stand up distribution in new communities. And we\u2019re at the very front end of this as well as we told you, we\u2019re 60% built out on our coverage. We have 40% more to go. So, there\u2019s a lot of opportunity left here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the piece that\u2019s not inconsequential, in fact is probably the most important of all of this, is that AT&amp;T now has claimed the network quality mantle. Network quality is ours, and we feel very strongly about this. And as I told you, we have been rated the best, the fastest and the high most reliable network by people who do this for a living on an independent basis. And as a marketing position, that\u2019s a great place to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re starting to see the impacts of this in key segment customer churn, we\u2019re starting to see it in terms of gross add capability. And just having a strong network quality brand and message in the marketplace by itself is a growth strategy. And so bottom line, we\u2019re feeling pretty bullish about the wireless business right now. John, would you add anything?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brett, we think of the first responder community, has 3 million potential, to participate very little in that. We\u2019re growing it quickly now. But we also the secondary first responders, the guys who going in and restore power and restore hospitals, and work in that environment that don\u2019t necessarily wear firefighter hats or police badges, that\u2019s another 8 million or brings that total almost \u2013 that adds about 11 million to it. So that brings that community totaled about 14 million. That\u2019s a huge \u2013 that\u2019s the opportunity we view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then you think about them having multiple devices whether it be a tablet or a phone, and then you think about them having family members. So, it really is a very large scale. We are making great progress in getting authorized with agencies and adding customers. And adding customers, that were previously served by somebody else, but we\u2019re also very, as Randall said, this network is outstanding, and it\u2019s going to serve our existing customer base. And so, it\u2019s going to give us this opportunity quite frankly to lower churn to get better quality service to this existing 80 million customers \u2013 phone customers we have today. That\u2019s a real benefit that I have a difficult time putting a price tag on or giving predictions for. But I know it\u2019s a real benefit for us and for the shareholders, for the customers. So, we feel really good about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that leaves us just in a very smooth transition into 5G. This 5G Evolution is going on now to 5G Plus with our millimeter wave and our 20 markets that we\u2019re in today. And with the 5G in the core network, where we\u2019ll have nationwide coverage next year, we expect by the middle of the year. So, we really are leading in 5G. We really are \u2013 and FirstNet is enabling this, and it\u2019s going to have a lot of benefits to it. So, you can understand why we do feel good. We do feel good about what the team is doing and how they\u2019re performing, and optimistic about meeting targets going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last thing I\u2019ll say is the accounting side of it, you get 70% of this complete by the end of this year. And our network guys have surprised me on the positive side before. We\u2019re going to have a lot of the CapEx behind us on the build side. And the remaining piece would be software upgrades, so we feel really good about the financial aspects of this process also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank, Brett. We\u2019ll take the next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Will come from the line of Mike McCormack of Guggenheim. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael McCormack</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys, thanks. Randall, obviously a lot of news out there and it seems like the last game was about to change, I guess, fairly dramatically in the wireless business. Just sort of thinking, what are your thoughts over the next three to four years as you see potentially new entrants coming in? How does that change the AT&amp;T strategy going forward? And I guess, secondly on the Business Wireline side, just to circle back on that, it feels like \u2013 it sounds like you guys are going to much more on retention efforts around that. Is there something there with regard to share loss being stemmed that\u2019s also having a positive impact? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry, Mike. That last question, say it again, Business Wireline on retention\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael McCormack</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just on the Business Wireline side, it seems I\u2019ve been hearing that you guys been doing a much better job in retaining customers and probably shared to competitors. I just want to see if there\u2019s any commentary on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s \u2013 and it happens to be accurate. We have done a very good job as new big deals come up retaining those, and as I\u2019ve told you the pricing has been fairly rational in the marketplace. And so, yeah, we really have had not only on a retention basis, but also on an acquisition basis, picking up new logos. We\u2019ve picked up a number of new logos in the last year or so. And so that business, again, I just won\u2019t dwell on it, but it continues to surprise us in terms of how it\u2019s doing. And I\u2019d love to say it\u2019s all 100% great execution, but all of that was just good economic health. And American business is quite healthy right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of industry structure, there\u2019s a lot of noise out there right now in industry structure. And the news this morning that maybe T-Mobile is close to having a deal with the DOJ. I just \u2013 there\u2019s a \u2013 there are so many ifs around industry structure and who\u2019s going to be in the market, and who\u2019s not. It\u2019s actually hard to respond to it. But to answer your question directly, if Charlie Ergen has wireless assets and distribution or Sprint T-Mobile happens or doesn\u2019t happen, candidly, it doesn\u2019t change anything we\u2019re going to do for the next three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strategy is pretty well baked, and I think the strategy is resilient as it relates to changes in industry structure. It\u2019s a strategy from a wireless standpoint that is, first and foremost, centered around FirstNet, getting the FirstNet capability deployed, built, standing up new distribution, tapping that new market and just continuing to drive network quality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, obviously, the 5G deployment is high, high priority. Also, then pairing that with a unique content in HBO Max. It\u2019s not even here yet, but HBO Max will be a key part of this wireless strategy as we get into next year and pairing a very unique premium video content with our wireless and our TV and broadband business. So, whether anything happens with that or not, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now the status of these deals, it\u2019s obviously one that we\u2019re watching very closely, but there are so many ifs around, does the industry structure change or not. And the interesting part is it\u2019s set up where the DOJ is probably not going to be the last say on this deal. And I\u2019ve not seen this happen in M&amp;A before, where the state AGs have positioned themselves, where they will be the last say on any deal that gets done and they\u2019re kind of in a position where they\u2019re going to be grading the DOJ\u2019s work as we go through this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, thinking about state AGs and then the rumors and so forth in the marketplace, what level of comfort they\u2019ll take that the antitrust concerns and fix is Charlie Ergen coming into the wireless business, that\u2019s been decades in the making, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they react to that. So, a lot of things up in the air. It\u2019s hard to say which way this thing goes, but at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t change anything we\u2019re doing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next up, we have the line of Michael Rollins of Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Rollins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you consider balancing revenue performance and profitability, can you discuss the role that content exclusivities will play in the future for AT&amp;T in 2 respects? First, on the content in sports rights, like NFL SUNDAY TICKET that you distribute through DIRECTV, and then second, separately, how you think about monetizing the content library in WarnerMedia on an exclusive basis, whether it\u2019s through HBO Max or other distributors like Netflix?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Hi, Mike. Yes. So, start with the NFL SUNDAY TICKET exclusivity. That\u2019s something that served DIRECTV well for many years. However, unfortunately, right now, that content is tied to our satellite product. And so, it serves a good value as we come into the fall. It\u2019ll be an important retention tool. But in terms of an opportunity to grow our business with that, when it\u2019s anchored to a satellite product, it\u2019s kind of hard to utilize it. So hopefully, over time, we can address that and move it on to our other platforms. And I think it can be a really important piece of growing our other platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you think about NBA, Major League Baseball, a lot of the content that \u2013 is \u2013 content rights that are held by the Turner companies, whether it be TNT or TBS and the NBA Final 4, and then playoffs fit that as well, those are obviously really important variables. And they\u2019ve been very, very important in making Turner very unique content as we market it to other distributors, but also as we begin to put that content on our HBO Max platform. This will be at the early stages of HBO Max, but you should assume that ultimately, HBO Max will have live elements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And those live elements, both unique live sports, premium sports, the ones we just went through, NBA, Major League Baseball, NCAA basketball, those are going to be really, really important elements for HBO Max. The same with news, and you can go through the areas of news that we think are very, very important, and will do quite well as an element of HBO Max.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So exclusive content has been important for as long as the TV business has been around. We don\u2019t see that changing, and you should assume that we will take advantage of opportunities, both within Turner and don\u2019t forget Bleacher Report. We have some great exclusive live content in Bleacher Report, from NBA to soccer, European soccer and so forth. So, a lot of opportunities to take advantage of the unique content deals that we have within WarnerMedia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next up, we have the line of Kannan Venkateshwar of Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kannan Venkateshwar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I may on the Entertainment Business, if you just look at the performance this particular quarter, despite losing subs, you, of course, did well on revenues and EBITDA relative to expectation then. So, I guess, it\u2019s getting to a point where the yield is better than the sub-losses overall. And therefore, when you look at some of these new product launches, the central line device going forward and even DIRECTV NOW, how are you thinking about \u2013 what\u2019s the product vision behind it? Is it more to manage that? Or is it more for growth? And is video growth from a subscriber perspective really important going forward? Or should we just assume that because the focus is margins and growth, margins and top line stability, the focus will more be on price and costs?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi, Kannan. This is Randall again. You\u2019ve nailed the equation. I mean, that\u2019s exactly what the equation is. It\u2019s \u2013 one has to ask, how is it that subscribers can decline like this and margins expand? And it says a lot about the customers that are staying on the network, that they tend to be very high-value customers, tend to be very valuable customers as you think about where we are going as a company. And that is distributing unique content through as many distribution points as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, as you think about the product portfolio going forward, which is what you have teed up, it\u2019s interesting. The DIRECTV product is going to have a really long life, and they\u2019re going to be segments of the market for a long time, but that\u2019s how you\u2019ll address those segments of the market. This thin client product that were bringing to market, it literally takes the customer acquisition costs and cuts it in half. And the beauty of that is that you can begin to address a fundamental problem with the current linear TV business, and that is the price point, but the content costs just continuing to grow. You heard me talk about Nexstar wanting 100% increase on their broadcast rights and so forth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve got to find a way to get the cost curve down on this product, so we can keep people into the product for a longer-term basis. So, as you drive customer acquisition costs in half on AT&amp;T TV, the new product we\u2019re bringing to market, then you can bring the price points down and hold margins and still have the same value equation from a customer standpoint. So, DIRECTV, good product, will be there for a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">AT&amp;T TV, you should assume, this will be the workhorse over the next couple of years. And we will put our shoulder and our muscle behind AT&amp;T TV, get a lower price point, shore up this customer base over the next couple of years. And then the part that shouldn\u2019t be missed, and we haven\u2019t given any subscriber numbers on HBO digital because we just had Game of Thrones, and we added a lot of digital subscribers. And we will, as we get to the WarnerMedia Day, we\u2019ll give some visibility into those. But until we kind of know what the churn characteristics of a product like this looks like, we\u2019re going to be a little guarded about giving subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But here\u2019s what we do know, and that is HBO \u2013 DISH stopped carrying HBO. And year-over-year, we\u2019re actually up HBO subscribers. That tells you how strong the digital subscriber performance of this thing was. And churn is hanging in there pretty strong in the third quarter because as Game of Thrones went off, the HBO folks, we gave them more capital to invest in content. So, in comes the new season of Big Little Lies. It\u2019s performed very well. Chernobyl was a blowout success. After Big Little Lies ended last Sunday. Now we have Succession coming online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The new season of Barry is coming into play, and this thing is just feeling pretty good. And so, as you think about a video portfolio, DIRECTV, AT&amp;T TV, HBO, which we\u2019re getting more and more conviction that HBO Max is going to be meaningful, you can imagine that those are the places we\u2019re going to put our shoulder and our muscle as we move forward. And the implications of that to profitability, we think, are pretty important.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, we\u2019ll give more visibility on the WarnerMedia Day in October. But bottom line, we like how the video portfolio is shaping up here, and you can listen to that discussion and begin to appreciate where you would expect our marketing and customer acquisition muscle to go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Randall, if I could, one thing to add. All that investment that Randall was talking about and all these new shows that\u2019s showing up, first of all, you\u2019ve seen the 3% revenue increase at HBO ties exactly to what Randall said. How are you doing that without strong digital performance? It\u2019s like all these new shows that he\u2019s talking about, we\u2019ve made those content investments. We continue to invest in content just like CapEx throughout the year. And that is in \u2013 that is already included in those free cash flow numbers that we\u2019ve shown up through this year and included in our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we are making decisions to continue to invest. We\u2019re doing that today. You\u2019re seeing the build on 5G today. You\u2019re seeing this investment in content today. And with all of that, we\u2019re still coming back to this kind of $4 a share of free cash flow, not only for the trailing 12 months, but for this year. So, I\u2019d say this, we are investing in the business, particularly in the comments around I made on WarnerMedia and HBO and those types, but also across the board. It\u2019s just really important to keep that in mind, and we\u2019re still generating just tremendous cash flows, not only in total, but on a per-share basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our last question will come from the line of Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Horan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Randall, can you dive into the 5G strategy a little bit more? It does feel like now you could be a few years ahead of your peers, and it seems like a great opportunity to gain share, maybe grow ARPUs here, but are you going to be able to deploy the 5G software as soon as the FirstNet build has gone by the end of next year? And can you talk about maybe what the go-to-market strategy will look like? Will you look to gain share more so or will it be to grow ARPUs? And just practically speaking, from a customer perspective, how much more speed or network capacity or latency will they really see off the bat and starting in 2021?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi, Tim. You bet. We are pretty consistent in talking about the advantages of FirstNet, and that it\u2019s allowing us to deploy this 5G hardware with one touch on the sales side. So, we climbed the sales side, and we\u2019re doing a number of things. We\u2019re turning up the FirstNet hardware and the FirstNet spectrum, and then we\u2019re turning up all this other latent data spectrum that we own as we climb the tower and putting the 5G hardware in place. And we\u2019ve put the beta alpha tag on the phone for 5G Evolution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I know some of our competitors didn\u2019t like that, but it\u2019s proving to be exactly what we told the market that it would be. You turn up all the spectrum, you put the new technology in place and there is a speed enhancement. And we are unquestionably the fastest network in the market just because of that capacity served. And we are literarily in the process of, by end of 2019, we\u2019ll have increased the total capacity of this network, John had a slide on this, by 50%. There are just inherent performance improvements from that alone that we\u2019re seeing and our customers are experiencing, and our churn is reflecting this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now 5G, to your question, will a software be ready? By mid-year next year, as we\u2019ve turned all \u2013 put all this hardware in place, we will have a nationwide footprint of 5G. So yes, the software will be turned up. And by mid-year, we\u2019ll have a nationwide footprint of 5G. We are also in the process of market-by-market turning up our millimeter wave spectrum 5G into that spectrum band. And as you know, when you put 5G into that millimeter wave band, that\u2019s when you get these radical speed lifts, and that\u2019s when you start to get the gig-type speeds. And we have it up in areas here in Dallas, for example. And I have a Samsung phone that I carry around. And I routinely, when I do speed tests here in Dallas, get over 1 gig speeds, get 2 gig on some occasions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, you\u2019re going to have some radical step-up in speed performance as we deploy this in the millimeter wave on top of our lower-ban spectrum where we turn it up over the course of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The really high-performance millimeter wave spectrum is going to come market-by-market, and it will take a while to deploy the really high-speed spectrum. As we turn it up, Tim, you should expect our focus will be a little different to some of our competitors. It is a business-driven focus at the go-down. And we think it\u2019s really important because we can deploy this technology. If somebody needs a connected factory or connected plant, we\u2019re doing this in Austin now, you will see us do that. If somebody needs a Wi-Fi replacement for their business operations, we can deploy and we can replace that. If somebody has IoT applications, we can begin to deploy this and roll these services out kind of commensurate with the network deployment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, it will be business-driven at first. As we get broad coverage of the millimeter wave, and this is really important, as our customers begin to get handsets into their hands that can use this technology, which right now, is pretty limited number of handsets, but as we exit next year there\u2019ll be a significant \u2013 they\u2019ll be in the dozen more handsets where people can use this technology, then you\u2019ll see us ratchet it up, the marketing and the promotion. We don\u2019t want to get too aggressive with the consumer right now where there aren\u2019t handsets in the marketplace and there isn\u2019t significant coverage. That will happen as we go through the course of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we do agree with you that we have an advantage here. We have a deployment advantage, and we think we\u2019ll have nationwide, this broad 5G deployment mid-year, and that\u2019s going to be important for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Stephens</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And let me wrap up, and then hand it over for Randall for some closing comments. But specifically, on the quarter, we had solid revenue growth. And we met our service revenue growth in mobility. Quality EBITDA growth, solid EPS, strong free cash flows and continued investment in both content and network that are showing up in our results. So, we feel like it was a very good quarter, and we are very \u2013 and we remain optimistic going forward. Our ability to generate cash and manage our balance sheet is without question, and we feel very good about it. Randall, let me turn it over to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Randall Stephenson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have much to add. I would we just point, all of the commitments we gave to you last year, at the end of the year, we are hitting every one of those. And we\u2019re checking the box on each of them. I am gaining greater and greater confidence we\u2019ll hit each of those as we go through the course of this year. The debt we\u2019ll have at a very reasonable place as we exit this year, I\u2019ll be \u2013 I fully expect that we\u2019ll be buying some stock back as we go through this year and the cash flows continue to produce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And look, I hope you\u2019re seeing in WarnerMedia why we thought this asset was so important for us to own. This is a great business, great talent, great people running it. HBO is firing on all cylinders. Warner Bros. is doing terrific. And all this is coming together to give us great confidence that HBO Max is going to be something special in the marketplace. And we\u2019ll get more to that, more of that to you in October. We look forward to seeing everybody there. Thank you for joining the call, and look forward to seeing you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Viola</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So long, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And ladies and gentlemen still connected, that does conclude the presentation for this morning. Again, we thank you very much for all of your participation and for using our conferencing system with Event Management. At this time, you may now disconnect.</p>", "twitContent": "$T - AT&T Inc.
