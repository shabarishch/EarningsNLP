Thanks for joining us today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered another robust quarter of earnings, cash flow and shareholder returns, reflecting our ongoing efforts to structurally improve our company and drive sustained industry-leading performance. We reported $9.1 billion of earnings, an increase of $1.2 billion compared to last quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While the market provided a bit of tailwind, our success was enabled by the continued strength of our operational performance, which reflects the hard work of our people across the company. Whether it\u2019s continuing to drive efficiency in maintenance and turnarounds, running at high throughputs and utilization rates, or delivering big projects at first quintile cost and schedule, the excellent work of our people underpins our results and sustains our drive to deliver industry-leading performance in everything we do. The work is fundamentally strengthening the underlying earnings power of the company, establishing a strong foundation to deliver industry-leading results in any price environment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consistent with our capital allocation strategy, we continue to share the success of the company with our shareholders. This morning, we were pleased to announce a 4% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share. This year is our 41<sup>st</sup> consecutive year of annual dividend increases, a record that we\u2019re proud of and that we know our investors value highly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to strengthen our portfolio of businesses by investing in advantaged high return opportunities while divesting businesses that are no longer a strategic fit. During the quarter, we closed on the sale of our Thailand refinery, bringing our year-to-date cash proceeds from asset sales to more than $3 billion. We followed this in October with the close of the refinery sale in Italy. Recently announced acquisitions are great examples of the and equation, meeting the world\u2019s needs for energy and essential products and reducing emissions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Acquiring Denbury strengthens our position to economically reduce emissions in hard-to-decarbonize industries, which today have limited practical options. We see the potential to drive strong returns with the capacity to reduce the nation\u2019s carbon emissions by 100 million tons per year - that\u2019s 20 times our current CO2 off-take agreements with CF Industries, Linde and Nucor, which by themselves could reduce CO2 emissions by an amount equivalent to replacing two million cars with EVs, roughly the same number of electric vehicles currently on U.S. roads. We expect to close the transaction in early November with Denbury shareholders scheduled to vote next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earlier this month, we signed an agreement to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources in another all-stock transaction. This combination will further strengthen our already advantaged upstream portfolio and create significant value for the shareholders of both companies. Together, we will recover more resource more efficiently and with a lower environmental impact. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We plan to accelerate Pioneer\u2019s Permian net zero ambition by 15 years and fully leverage their advances in water recycling. This deal is a win any way you look at it - good for our shareholders, good for the environment, good for the economy, and good for U.S. energy security. Neil will say more about the benefits of the transaction in a few moments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also continuing to drive profitable growth organically. In energy products, we achieved the highest third quarter refinery throughput on record, driven by our Beaumont refinery expansion. At a time of strong demand and low inventories, this project is providing 250,000 barrels per day of much needed new capacity to the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we recently started up our Baytown chemical expansion, which grows volume and improves mix. It provides 750,000 tons per year of new performance chemical capacity, including 350,000 tons of linear alpha olefins, marking our entry into this growing market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance with earnings of $9.1 billion and cash flow from operations of $16 billion. These results reflect the structural earnings improvements we\u2019ve delivered over the past several years as we\u2019ve improved our mix of assets and driven significant structural cost reductions, while maintaining our focus on industry-leading safety and reliability. We have lowered our structural costs by $9 billion since 2019, meeting our plan, and expect to deliver additional savings in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to identify opportunities to improve our base operations, including enhancing our maintenance and turnaround processes, strengthening our digital capabilities, and optimizing our supply chain. Our year-to-date production of 3.7 million oil-equivalent barrels per day is on track with our full year guidance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Capex investments of $18.6 billion year-to-date are on plan. We expect 2023 capex to finish the year at the top end of our guidance range as we continue to invest in high return advantaged projects, our top priority for creating long term shareholder value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As always, we remain focused on sharing the company\u2019s success with our shareholders. We delivered $8.1 billion in shareholder distributions in the third quarter, $3.7 billion in dividends, and $4.4 billion in share repurchases. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Neil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Neil Chapman</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Darren. Good morning everyone. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we said with you recently, Pioneer is arguably the best Permian pure play company with the largest undeveloped Tier 1 inventory in the Midland basin. Pioneer\u2019s premier asset base is matched by the quality of its workforce. Its employees are innovative and hard working and possess a deep knowledge of unconventional operations in the Permian. When you combine these attributes with our technology and industry-leading operational capabilities, we\u2019re confident we can unlock far more value together than either of us could do alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect synergies of approximately $1 billion before tax annually, beginning in the second year post closing, and an average of about $2 billion per year over the next decade driving double-digit returns. This transaction not only strengthens our current position but it also transforms our portfolio, increasing our exposure to short cycle low cost to supply liquids in the United States. Based on our initial assessment, we expect our combined Permian production to increase to approximately 2 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by the end of 2027. Downstream, this merger also increases the integration between high value light Permian crude and our premier refinery and chemical footprint on the U.S. Gulf Coast. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we\u2019ve said many times that we\u2019re working to solve the end equation, providing the energy and products society needs and reducing emissions, both ours and others. This transaction reflects both parts of our commitment. We will increase our Permian production with plans to accelerate Pioneer\u2019s net zero plan to 2035 from 2050, and decrease our combined Permian emissions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll pass it to Jennifer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Neil. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have two quick announcements to share with you. First, please mark your calendars for our annual corporate plan update scheduled for Wednesday, December 6 at 9:00 am Central time. Darren and Kathy are going to provide formal remarks and take live questions from our sell-side analysts [indiscernible]. Second, please keep an eye out for our 2024 Advancing Climate Solutions report. We expect to publish it online in mid-December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, we\u2019re going to begin our Q&amp;A session. Please note we continue to ask analysts to limit yourselves to one question as a courtesy to others; however, please remain on the line in case we need any clarifications. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, please bring us the first caller.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ms. Driscoll. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator instructions]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning and thanks for the update.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first question for me is on the Permian here. Slides 17 to 19 are interesting and incremental. I was wondering if you could take a moment to walk us through it. Just in the context of the investor feedback we\u2019ve gotten around the transaction, folks are looking for a little more clarity on the top line synergies that are going to come from better productivity. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Yes, good morning Neil. You know, what we outlined in the slide with the earnings release is really the basis of what I\u2019d always describe as real, quantifiable synergies that have created the deal space for this transaction. These synergies are already demonstrated in our existing operations, either in the Delaware of the Midland. It does not include the pipeline of new technologies that are either in the early stages of deployment or close to deployment. By applying what we\u2019ve already demonstrated, we\u2019re confident we can recover an additional 1 billion oil-equivalent barrels, more than either Pioneer or industry could have demonstrated with their existing performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the charts, we highlight two areas. One, industry\u2019s move to cube development. We\u2019ve moved to cube development to get the higher net present value. We were the pioneer in that, and that\u2019s obviously to avoid the parent-child impact. The top chart on there shows that we\u2019ve been drilling cube since 2020 100% in the Midland, and you can see that over the period, Pioneer has moved to 100% cubes as well. In 2022, when we were both developing 100% cubes, you can see we\u2019ve got equivalent recovery rates, but we\u2019re at notably lower quality acreage, lower quality resource, so equivalent recovery at lower quality resource, and when we look at truly comparable acreage, and that\u2019s really, really important because generalizations can lead to misleading results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the bottom, we talk about adjacent Martin County, where us and Pioneer and one of our other peers are drilling the same 10,000 lateral cubes, you can see we get a 20% higher recovery, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re all targeting the same intervals. These are [indiscernible] in similar proportions. What varies and what\u2019s the difference is the stacking and landing zones, and what varies is the optimal wealth spacing that we are delivering, which includes things like vertical orientation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just one final point on that, Neil, in terms of recovery - it\u2019s not just about how you deliver cubes. When you\u2019ve got better recovery, when you\u2019ve got better capital efficiency, it gives access to economically developing what we would describe as secondary benches. As you\u2019ll recall, like the Wolfcamp C and like the [indiscernible] mill extension, and in addition obviously we have other techniques that we attempt to keep confidential, which gives us this higher level of recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Neil Mehta</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Neil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Brackett</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. When you talk about your two million barrel a day initial sort of view of where production from the combined entity can get to in 2027, how do I think about the gating factor? Is that a fixed rig or activity or capex program and the volume is an outcome, or is that a volume target and you\u2019ll adjust activity down as more synergies come through?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes Bob, it\u2019s Neil again. I want to be clear - we don\u2019t have a volume target. We have a value target, we have a volume outcome, and that\u2019s really, really important. For our basis, we\u2019ve talked about an outcome being a million barrels a day by the end of 2027 based on our Delaware and Midland Basin. Based on our initial assessments of Pioneer\u2019s plans, obviously we\u2019ve had access to that through the due diligence process, we see that with similar capital spending as Pioneer has today, and you can equate that to a similar number of rigs, we would anticipate that Pioneer\u2019s production under Exxon Mobil and Pioneer\u2019s combined operations would also get to a million barrels a day by the end of 2027. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you add current production in the Midland Basin from both Pioneer and Exxon Mobil today, it\u2019s already at a million barrels a day. It\u2019s really important, though - volume is an outcome. We\u2019re striving for the value, that\u2019s why we focus on the cube development. But I would say the basis is consistent with existing capital spending that Pioneer are making today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do anticipate, as I\u2019ve just outlined, improvements in recovery. We do anticipate improvements in capital efficiency based on the synergies that we outlined in the earnings release, but that\u2019s not really built into that outlook of a million barrels a day from the Pioneer operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Brackett</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very clear, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to stick with upstream and take advantage of having you on the call here, Neil, and ask about Guyana. The slide noted that production is now coming in ahead of plan for the full year, a little bit better than your full year target, and part of that is the Payara start-up, part of that seems to be debottlenecking. I want to just focus on the debottlenecking opportunity. Could you walk us through how much uplift you\u2019ve realized so far versus nameplate, how much is left, and then the repeatability of this outperformance as we look at the additional FPSOs that are set to start up over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. We\u2019re really encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in Guyana. Let\u2019s just start with the two boats that are in our operation today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Liza 1, or Destiny had a nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels a day. We\u2019re consistently running that at about 150,000 barrels a day. Liza 2, Unity was a 220 capacity and we\u2019ve been running that consistently above 240,000 barrels a day, so those two combined are getting close to 400,000 barrels a day, which is quite a bit, and this comes from, I would just say, good operational performance. You look at every aspect of the operations, you tweak them, you push them, and you can get more and more out. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, we\u2019re starting up Payara, which is 220,000 barrels a day nameplate capacity. We would hope we would expect to have a similar type of uplift. There is no reason to think that we wouldn\u2019t. We have to start that up--the plan is to start that up in the middle of November, and that would give us a combined nameplate capacity of 560,000 barrels a day, but obviously with the first two boats running more like 400,000 barrels, we expect to be in excess of 600,000 barrels a day of production. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to add to that, we\u2019ve got three more boats in the pipeline, as you\u2019re aware. All three of the boats in the pipeline - that\u2019s the Yellowtail, Uaru, and then Whiptail, these are all larger boats, they\u2019re all 250,000 barrels a day. Yellowtail and Uara are in construction. Whiptail, we\u2019ve submitted the development plan to the government, and we would hope and expect to reach FID in 2024 for that, and that will give us a combined nameplate capacity of 1.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2027, but that doesn\u2019t include the uplift in performance--production performance that we\u2019ve got on the first two boats.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, we were certainly--our message to the organization is start it up safely, start it up on time, each boat - that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do on Payara, and once we get settled, we\u2019ll try and follow the same protocols that we\u2019ve done on the first two boats and strive to get maximum production out of the boat, and that\u2019s obviously good for the shareholders, it\u2019s good for the co-ventures, and it\u2019s even better for the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would add to Neil\u2019s comment, if you recall, we brought all our projects organization together to make sure that we were leveraging the best capability in terms of development in designing these projects. We\u2019ve also brought together our technology organizations, and the big benefit we have there is we\u2019re now leveraging not only the capacity that was in the upstream in terms of optimization around these facilities, but we\u2019ve decades and decades of experience of people optimizing and running our chemical plants and our refinery facilities to squeeze out and optimize every piece of the production pipeline and make sure that we are at the designed limits of the different equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That optimization, which has been kind of the lifeblood of the refining business, given the very narrow margins, has big payoffs when we apply it to the upstream facilities, and so there\u2019s an additional benefit just in terms of leveraging the broader organizational capability, which again has been part of our strategy from the very beginning, is to make sure that we\u2019re bringing to bear the best thinking across the corporation on the most important facilities and projects, and this is certainly one of those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks so much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Doug Leggate with Bank of America. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Leggate</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning everyone. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Darren, forgive me - I\u2019d like also to take advantage of Neil being on the call and follow on with a Guyana question, if I may. Neil, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to frame this question a little bit because a couple of years ago, you talked about if the deeper resource potential proved to be as prolific as the original targets that you had in the area, you could look to double your resource potential from 10 - at that time, you had announced potentially significantly larger. You haven\u2019t updated that resource number in a while. Now, you\u2019ve got Lancentfish, it looks like Fangtooth is in the queue based on your EIS submissions to Guyana, but yet you still talk about production capacity and not production. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question to you is with capability obviously keeping these boats filled for an extended period of time, what do you ultimately see as the production capacity--sorry, actual production as opposed to capacity trajectory through the end of the decade at this point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks Doug. There\u2019s probably two parts to that question. One is exploration and then one is production and capacity. Let me just handle exploration first.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, we\u2019ve had, as you\u2019re aware, three discoveries this year, including Lancetfish-2, which is the most recent one. We continue to integrate those results, both of exploration and appraisal drilling, and we\u2019re going to update that resource base when we see it is a significant change. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our program of exploration and appraisal continues, and the way I like to frame it is in the southeast corner of the Stabroek Block, we\u2019re continuing to appraise around our discoveries, and that will take a lot of work and a lot of activity. You know we have six drill ships in the basin and they\u2019re both--they\u2019re in development appraisal and exploration drilling. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to all that appraisal drilling that we\u2019re doing in the southeast part of the block, we\u2019re looking for what I would describe as anchor prospects further to the north and further to the west. We continue to look and we\u2019ve probably got order of magnitude three, what I\u2019d call true wildcats or exploration targets, looking for [indiscernible] wells in the next 10 to 12 months, something like that. That can change based on results of either the appraisal or the exploration drilling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, we\u2019re going to update when we see something meaningful and when we see something significant. We\u2019ve been very clear that we had six FPSOs in the pipeline - they are firm and I just in one of the previous questions outlined all of those. Indeed, they will have a capacity and you strive to keep them full all the time. As you know, Doug, one of the beauties about the Stabroek Block is the density of the resource and the proximity of these boats, which gives that potential for tie-backs well into the future. But the water cut will increase, as everybody knows, in deepwater, so we constantly look.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We like to talk about capacity and we optimize as we go, and we will increase the production versus the nameplate capacity as we go, and so that\u2019s why I think what we can be firm on is we will have six boats by the end of 2027, they will have a nameplate capacity of 1.2, and obviously we will strive to keep them as full of liquids or of oil as we can over that period. I think as we get closer to 2027, obviously we will update those numbers, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Leggatte</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Appreciate the full answer, Neil.

Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Richardson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you. We\u2019re going to keep Neil busy this morning. Another one on the Pioneer disclosure - appreciate the incrementals. Neil, I guess it sounds like from your previous comments, the million barrels a day target, that output is still there from the legacy composition and you\u2019re thinking about the additive from Pioneer. Can you talk a little bit about as you integrate the two assets, are you assuming some high grading around some of the higher quality acreage? Do you envision prioritizing more activity on one asset versus the other, or are you still kind of thinking about them as two separates? Also, maybe you can just talk a little bit about assumptions around acreage bolt-ons or any positions as well. Is there a lot of work to do in terms of extending some of this lateral length that you\u2019re talking about? Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, first of all, I would say it\u2019s very early in the process, of course. We\u2019ve done the due diligence, we\u2019re into transition now. I think it\u2019s very important to make the point, Pioneer are a very, very capable organization. They\u2019ve demonstrated that. What we\u2019re really excited about is the combination of these two organizations. Pioneer has a deep, deep understanding of the Midland Basin. As we\u2019ve talked about, this is absolutely in the fairway of Tier 1 quality resource, and Pioneer has done an exceptional job at developing that resource.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For our side, we\u2019ve got a whole range of different operating techniques, development plans and technologies, and it\u2019s the integration of those that we\u2019re most excited about. Everything we\u2019re seeing in the initial transition work would suggest all of that is correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you just look at the acreage position and you look at where Exxon are--Exxon Mobil are and Pioneer are, obviously it gives an opportunity for both high grading the inventory, and that includes bolt-ons. I have to say that Scott Sheffield and his organization have done an extraordinary job bolting on and increasing their acreage in the basin, and they have a very, very capable land organization, and we look forward to working with those firms. I think it\u2019s a combination that\u2019s going to be most powerful in developing that resource. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d just add to what Neil said, if you look at what we\u2019ve been doing over the last six years, it\u2019s really been around integrating our organizations, consolidating them, and making sure that we\u2019re concentrating like capabilities into the same organization, and that is paying huge dividends. This is no different. The intent is to fully integrate the Pioneer organization and its people into our business. My expectation is we\u2019ll bring a lot of advantages to their acreage, but at the same time, we expect their people to bring a lot of advantages to other parts of our business, including what we\u2019re doing in the Delaware. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our whole strategy is really around the value you create by taking experts in areas and getting the collaboration and the innovation that comes from that, so there won\u2019t be a separate approach here. It will be one. I think what you\u2019re seeing today, to Neil\u2019s point, the fact that we\u2019re in very early stage, but as we get together and work through the plans and the development, it will be one seamless integrated organization and plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steve, just one small addition to illustrate that. I\u2019ve talked before that we have a basin-wide remote operations centers in Houston where we control all our operations in Houston - that\u2019s drilling, that\u2019s fracking, the field operations, that\u2019s methane tracking, methane emissions tracking as well from one central control center in Houston. Obviously our plan would be to bring in the whole Pioneer operations in time to have one central organization. What this gives you is it gives you all that competency, all that expertise, applies is to the whole of Midland Delaware Basins from one central control center. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Richardson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Roger Read of Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Roger Read </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Keeping with the upstream theme here, I\u2019d like to dig into the, I guess call it a slight transition here, the high value-added or high margin liquid barrels, so specifically the comment, 100,000 barrels a day higher versus 2022\u2019s gases declined or been sold, and the liquids have grown. But as you think about the change out to 2027, the growth in Guyana, the growth in the Permian, and we compare that to where you were, say in 2019, how do you think about the total value-added liquid barrels, the impact on margins, the impact on returns? What\u2019s the right way for us to think about the transition of the company over roughly that eight-year period?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Roger, it\u2019s Neil again. Let\u2019s just park the Pioneer acquisition for a moment and just talk about our existing plans as Exxon Mobil. Back in 2018 and 2019, I talked about the strength of our developments that we had in the pipeline, and obviously they were headlined by Guyana and by the Permian. What I said at the time is what you will see is an increase in the percent of liquids in our portfolio and a reduction in the percent of dry gas of the total. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I outlook to 2027, we will go from something sub-65% liquids to something around 70% liquids in our portfolio in 2027, and 15% or thereabouts of liquefied natural gas, so that takes us up to 85%, I would call liquids index. Obviously 80% of our LNG sales index to Brent or to crude oil. That\u2019s a big transition but it\u2019s driven by the quality of those resources, primarily in the Permian and Guyana, and we\u2019re going to be adding onto that, of course, the programs we have developed we have in LNG in Papua New Guinea and then in Mozambique at the end of the decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d just add one other comment - if you take the liquids and the LNG, which would take us to 85% liquids indexed in 2027, of the gas that remains, 7% of that is associated gas, so in other words gas associated with liquids production. You can see that we\u2019ll be in the order of magnitude of 7% or 8% of dry gas in our portfolio at that time, and that\u2019s pre the Pioneer acquisition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d just add to that, Roger, if you just step back and think more conceptually around the strategy and what we\u2019re trying to do, every one of our businesses is focused on moving to the left-hand side of the cost of supply curve, so that we remain robust to any period in the commodity cycle and making sure that we\u2019re positioned competitively versus everyone else in the industry. That drive over time to reshape the portfolio continues to move our collective production to the left and to lower cost, and then at the same time adding higher value barrels, we\u2019re lowering cost and increasing revenue, and so that\u2019s where the value game is getting played out. That\u2019s the work that we\u2019ve been doing and that\u2019s the high grading that you\u2019ve seen in the portfolio and the improvements in structural cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We mentioned at the top of the meeting that we\u2019ve actually achieved the $9 billion in structural cost this quarter, third quarter, so a quarter ahead of what our initial plans were, and we expect to see more in the fourth quarter. As we go forward with the changes that we\u2019ve been making in the organization continuing, we\u2019re going to continue to deliver more structural cost savings. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The whole strategy is around making sure that we have the best portfolio and the most resilient portfolio, so that we can basically be successful irrespective of the commodity price environment that we\u2019re in, and that we\u2019re well positioned versus others in the industry. That is the strategy, and you see that playing out certainly in the upstream, but you also seeing it playing out in the downstream where we\u2019ve been high grading our assets there and playing out in our chemical business, where we continue to bring on units that produce high performance products. That strategy is manifesting itself in each of our businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then I\u2019ll just end on that same philosophy underpins what we\u2019re doing in low carbon solution. As we build out that business and position ourselves for the long term, it\u2019s making sure that every investment that we\u2019re making, every value chain that we\u2019re creating, that Dan and his team have a clear view about where that will sit in the cost supply curve, or you can think of it as the cost of abatement curve, and making sure that we\u2019re going to be advantaged versus the rest of the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Roger Read</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from John Royall of JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Royall</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is on the capex. Could you maybe help us bridge the top end that you\u2019re guiding to now for this year versus maybe the midpoint? It\u2019s a tight range, so not super material, but just any color there would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then I know you\u2019ll give your update in December, but is there any color you can give us directionally on what you\u2019re thinking of for next year on the legacy business, prior to layering in Pioneer? Just anything on the moving pieces for capex next year would be great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathryn Mikells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say nothing really unusual going on in capex. As you stated, it was a pretty tight range to start with, obviously with a focus on us looking to ensure that we\u2019re investing in advantaged high return projects - that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re delivering, so I would characterize this as updated guidance that\u2019s pretty consistent with our plans, and we can give you a further update when we get to that corporate plan discussion later on in December, but we feel very good about our overall execution. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Darren mentioned earlier, we\u2019re bringing projects online at a cost and schedule that\u2019s typically within the top quintile, so we feel really good about our capabilities and our execution and our ongoing focus with our highest priority, ensuring that we\u2019re executing great projects with high returns for our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I might just add to that, as we think about capex, we provide that range because we recognized going into the year that things move around a bit, and as we prosecute a plan that with time, we find additional opportunities as things move around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at where we\u2019re at through the third quarter, we are right on our plan, and so as we move forward, we\u2019re going to continue to do the things that we had planned to do last year, but I would say we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to build on the value proposition. If we see it, we\u2019re going to go after it. We\u2019re not going to constrain ourselves artificially to a guidance range if we find an opportunity set; but to date, things are moving pretty consistent with where we thought we were going to be, and frankly as we look out going forward, continue to see a very consistent set of opportunity sets that we\u2019re going to prosecute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the one change that we\u2019ll spend more time talking about in low carbon solutions is as that business matures and we establish, I\u2019d say, an advantaged position, there are a lot of opportunities coming our way, so we\u2019re working our way through those opportunities and making sure that we focus on the highest priority ones, the ones that generate the most value and are competitive in our portfolio. We\u2019ll talk more about that as we get into the plan release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Royall</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very helpful, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Jason Gabelman of TD Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Gabelman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A lot\u2019s happened in the past few months, but about three months ago, there was a handful of news articles about Exxon\u2019s lithium endeavors. I just wanted to get an update on that. Are you still drilling in the Smackover for lithium, are you exploring potential processing unit there, and how have things trended the past few months? Do you expect that to figure into your growth plans here over the next five years? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, I\u2019ll take that. I think just stepping back and maybe setting the context of what we\u2019re trying to do, I\u2019ll call it in the transition space, and frankly more broadly, go back to the fundamental of what are our key technology competencies and capabilities, and then what businesses lend themselves to those capabilities where we can carve out an advantage and produce the products society needs. Rather than chase what I would say is the current narrative or the current conventional wisdom as to what the world is going to need, it\u2019s focus first on what we can fundamentally contribute and bring an advantage to and therefore generate returns higher than the rest of industry, and then figure out how those advantages apply themselves to what the world needs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously lithium is an important part of the transition going forward in electrification and the need for batteries and storage of power and energy, and so we\u2019ve looked at that space and clearly with the opportunity at Smackover and the ability to drill, extract the lithium from the brine water and re-inject that, it\u2019s got a much lower environmental impact than the current production process for lithium. It fits very well with our capabilities and on the cost of supply curve, it\u2019s very competitive, so it looks attractive, and the challenge that we\u2019ve been giving to Dan and his team is to develop a business plan where that becomes material with respect to what Exxon Mobil--Exxon Mobil\u2019s portfolio, and effectively competes for capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Dan and his team develop that concept and that potential business, that\u2019s looking more and more promising, and we see an opportunity to really leverage the things that we\u2019re pretty good at in the base case, and it\u2019s very synergistic with our traditional businesses. I think when we come out and talk about the plan, we\u2019ll talk more about where we see the lithium business going, but it looks fairly promising at this stage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would just say, the aperture\u2019s wide open. I think for a long time, we\u2019ve been characterized as an energy company, and that almost discounts what is one of the world\u2019s largest chemical businesses, which we feel pretty good about. It comes back to this fundamental capability of managing and transforming hydrogen and carbon molecules to products that the world needs and leveraging our capabilities, and lithium fits into that along with our other businesses in bio-fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage. We\u2019ll continue to develop those, and again, as I said earlier, seeing that opportunity space and the opportunity to generate higher return projects is looking more and more promising, so I would expect that to be part of the portfolio going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Gabelman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Ryan Todd of Piper Sandler. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Todd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Maybe one follow-up on some of the earlier Permian conversation. You were always known as developing your side of the Permian on a very long term plan. You\u2019d built out a lot of infrastructure early on. On the infrastructure side, as you think about this post the Pioneer transaction on infrastructure, do you have the combined infrastructure in place that you need to arrive at the 2 million barrels a day of combined production? Will this require any additional infrastructure spend or any shift around in how you think about things versus previously anticipated, and maybe just any comments on whether you see any potential bottlenecks in the basin over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes Ryan, it\u2019s Neil. I\u2019ll take that question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think as you\u2019re aware, there is a big difference between the Delaware and the Midland Basins. The Midland Basin has got far more mature infrastructure, and I would say that Pioneer has done an exceptional job in both developing and acquiring and contracting both infrastructure to exit product and for water. It\u2019s quite a difference versus the Delaware. Of course, in the Delaware, we had to put in that infrastructure in place. We did it at scale, we built this large central processing facility called Cowboy. We currently have a capacity there of about 250,000 barrels a day of crude and about 400 Mcfd of gas. We plan to expand that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the Midland, most of that infrastructure already exists. There is always going to be incremental investment, but nothing like the scale, Ryan, that we have seen in the Delaware. I feel very good about the infrastructure we\u2019ve put in place in the Delaware, and we made that investment upfront. We talked about it in 2018 and 2019, and we\u2019re clearly benefiting from that investment that we made now. Quite a contrast in the Midland.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would add to that, if you go back in time, as we were looking at the integrated value chain, we were certainly focused on the molecules that we were producing in the Permian but we also recognized it was an opportunity for us to take advantage of the geographic locale and the proximity to our facilities in the Gulf Coast to optimize broader Permian production, and so we built the logistics systems, pipeline systems and the capability within our facilities to manage that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we\u2019re now going to be bringing into the portfolio in the Midland fits very well with this broader play of an integrated value chain and making sure that we\u2019re maximizing the value of those molecules through our own facilities. As we said early on when we first introduced this deal, that piece of the equation, which we believe there is a value opportunity on in terms of better managing the molecules from end to end, from the crude clear through to the finished products, we believe there\u2019s additional opportunity there. We\u2019ve got to get in and work through the details of that. My view is that\u2019s additional upside to what we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s one I feel really good about and the one that, frankly, we anticipated early on by making sure that we\u2019d built the capacity ahead of actually needing it for our own molecules, so we\u2019re in a very good position there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Ryan, I didn\u2019t answer your question - do we anticipate any bottlenecks, and the answer to that is based on what we have seen so far during the transition work and the due diligence, the answer is no, we don\u2019t see any bottlenecks in getting to the production levels that we anticipate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Todd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Neal Dingmann of Truist Securities. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Neal Dingmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, thanks for the time. Darren, maybe for you or Kathy, my question is on shareholder return. It looks like you paid out a bit over 100% of free cash flow following the prior quarter - I think you were closer to even higher than that, maybe about 118%. I\u2019m just wondering, when you think about shareholder return, will you continue to lean into the buybacks as you look in the out years, or maybe just if you could give a little bit of color. I think I understand your role, your thoughts on the dividend side, so maybe I\u2019m asking a bit more on the share buybacks going forward. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathryn Mikells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m happy to take that. If you look at our overall free cash flow results in the quarter, it was just under $12 billion at $11.7 billion, and we paid out $8.1 billion to shareholders, and that was between $3.7 billion in dividends and $4.4 billion in the share repurchase program. In fact, in the quarter our cash balance actually went up $3.4 billion, and we ended the quarter at $33 billion, so I think you can see that in the quarter, we were in fact well under 100% in terms of what we paid out, which is what enables us to grow our cash balance and strengthen our balance sheet even further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, when you look overall at our approach to capital allocation, our priorities continue to be the same. First and foremost, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re investing in advantaged projects that are differentiated, are going to drive high returns for our shareholders. We do that both organically and, as you\u2019ve seen recently, inorganically as well, making sure we\u2019re maintaining a really strong balance sheet - we need that. Ultimately at some point, the cycle will turn against us and that balance sheet will be there for us to lean into, and being balanced in our approach as to how we share the success of the company and those rewards with our shareholders. I think you can continue to see that balance coming through between dividends and share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re looking to be more consistent in our share repurchase program - again, I think you\u2019re seeing that. We continue to say we\u2019re on track to execute $17.5 billion of share repurchases this year. We\u2019ll complete that before the end of the year and we already have a program in place, a similar program in place for 2024, so we\u2019re trying to get that balance right. It\u2019s important that we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet that can carry us through the cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Neal Dingmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Kathy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, good morning. Neil, the industry in the Permian, whether it\u2019s for emission reasons or for cost efficiency, seems to move and trying to electrify the operation as much as we could, can you share with us where is Exxon in that journey? How far are you in terms of electrifying your operation in the Permian, and when you\u2019re comparing to Pioneer, I don\u2019t know whether you have the information that you can share, and whether you guys are ahead of them or that this will be part of the $2 billion of synergy benefit, or that you\u2019re going to do more aggressively on that, this is going to be on top. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks Paul, good to hear from you. From our perspective, we have, I think, 17 rigs running right now in the Permian. All of those rigs are electrified, so we\u2019re 100% on rigs and we\u2019re working on fracs. Right now, I think we have one electric frac out of six frac crews running in the Permian. This is all part of our drive to get to Permian net zero that we said we would get to by 2030. Our plans are in place for that and we\u2019re on schedule for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That program, it\u2019s simple as this - you have to reduce methane emissions. We\u2019re well on track with reducing methane emissions. We have no routine flaring in the Permian now. We\u2019ve replaced over 6,400 pneumatic devices, so you eliminate or your reduce methane emissions, then you electrify your operations, and as I\u2019ve just described, we\u2019re long way down the road in terms of electrification. Then we have to secure renewable electricity for those rigs and frac crews, and that\u2019s the program we\u2019re working on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of Pioneer, I don\u2019t have those numbers for Pioneer in terms of where they are on electrification, but what we have said is that we\u2019re going to advance Pioneer\u2019s target to go to net zero from 2050 to 2035, so 15 years sooner than anticipated, and that will follow probably that same protocol, that same process of reducing methane, electrification, and then securing renewable electricity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would add to that, I think Scott and the team at Pioneer have been--this has been an area of focus for them, and I know they have worked hard to drive those down. The advantage that we bring is we\u2019ve got a large organization, more resources. We\u2019ve got a technical organization that has been leaning into this space and working broadly with the industry and other organizations to develop the technology to better manage methane. Neil talked about the central organization that we\u2019ve put in place to kind of monitor everything that\u2019s happening out in the unconventional space and make sure that we\u2019re responding in real time to things that we\u2019re seeing through this centralized operating center. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bringing the Pioneer portfolio into that center and then allowing us to apply a lot of the work that, frankly, our scale and size has allowed us to advance, I think is going to make a big improvement in what we\u2019re doing with Pioneer, just by bringing additional capability there. I think the culture and the mindset is already in place. We\u2019re now going to bring some additional resources in to apply, and so my expectation is that we\u2019re going to see--we\u2019re going to raise the game here, just because we\u2019re bringing some additional capabilities to support what was already, I think, a very important focus for the Pioneer organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Is the savings on your electrification is already built into that $2 billion synergy benefit? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, in terms of the synergy benefits, as you know and we\u2019ve talked about many, many times, it\u2019s not just about the cost of the rig, it\u2019s about the quality of the rig and the performance of the rig, but electrification of those rigs doesn\u2019t really impact that. The electrification of all of those facilities is built into our plans going forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would say our drive to bring their net zero commitment forward by 15 years, we\u2019ve also built that into our thinking around getting net synergies there, so we\u2019ve comprehended the additional effort required to improve the emissions profile and bring their net zero ambitions forward, so all that\u2019s netted with our synergy numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Cheng</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question is from Josh Silverstein with UBS. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Silverstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, good morning everyone. On the Pioneer acquisition call, you had mentioned that the inventory of the combined companies in the Permian was around 15, 20 years. Was just curious how that may be split between the Pioneer asset and your Delaware asset, and does it contemplate the accelerated growth rate improves the outlying longer laterals or a potential plateau? I\u2019m just curious to get some more details there, because there was a view of Pioneer having over 20 years of inventory, so any more details there would be helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think Josh, it\u2019s early stages. I mean, the numbers that we gave and that you just referenced in our initial release are based on our understanding. We\u2019d certainly say that the combined resource for the two companies is order of magnitude 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels - that\u2019s 15 to 20 years life. Most of our resource is, as you\u2019re aware, is on the Delaware side. Obviously Pioneer is exclusive in the Midland side, so that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s based on our early assessments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Silverstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, maybe if there was just any more details as far as what your split may be of that 16 versus what theirs may be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I mean, they\u2019re close, I would say in total. Exxon\u2019s is closer to 9, Pioneer\u2019s is closer to 7, is what I would say in total, but that\u2019s based on our initial understanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the resource.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Chapman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the resource, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Silverstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have time for one more question. Our final question is from Sam Margolin of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, thanks for taking the question at the end. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to follow up on the capital allocation question and the dividend increase specifically. We\u2019ve talked a lot about this in the past, that this dividend increase looks like it\u2019s roughly the same as the amount of the share repurchase in terms of percentage, and I know you\u2019re issuing share for Pioneer but you\u2019ve also got a pathway to a lot of upstream growth and then downstream is growing too, as we learned about in the product solutions spotlight. You\u2019re running with sort of a significant operational cash surplus on a recurring basis, even before this growth, and so just wondering about your thoughts on dividend growth going forward and if we are through this period where you were tending the balance sheet and the portfolio, and now some of this growth will translate to sort of a dividend CAGR that is in line with the operations. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathryn Mikells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, so we have always said we\u2019re looking to ensure we have a dividend that\u2019s sustainable, competitive and growing. I think the increase of $0.04 to the quarterly dividend is very reflective of that. I think it also reflects the overall confidence that we have in the business and the underlying improvement in earnings power that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. I mean, by any metric, this was a really strong quarter, whether you look at earnings, cash, shareholder returns. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was a very strong quarter and we have a great degree of confidence in the business, so we increased the dividend a bit more than we did about a year ago. Obviously we have a cadence now of looking at the dividend in the fourth quarter of the year, and that increase is very reflective of our confidence in the business and our underlying performance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darren Woods</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would just add to that, Sam, obviously we view the dividend as a commitment, and as we saw through the pandemic, even when things get tough, we work hard to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to deliver on that commitment to our shareholders. As we think about going forward and the volatility in the markets and the commodity cycle, we do need to make sure that as we think about growth in the dividend, that we also think about sustainability and the ability to deliver on that commitment, irrespective of what the market throws at us. That goes into the equation as we think about that going forward, and when we\u2019ve got additional cash that we want to distribute, we\u2019ve always got the buyback, which obviously as Kathy said, we\u2019re looking to have a more consistent level of that as well. That\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sam Margolin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jennifer Driscoll</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome, and thanks everyone for joining the call and for your questions today. We will post a transcript of our Q&amp;A session on the investor website next week. We look forward to connecting with you again on December 6 for our corporate plan update.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, have a nice weekend, everyone, and I\u2019ll turn it back to the Operator to conclude our call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.
