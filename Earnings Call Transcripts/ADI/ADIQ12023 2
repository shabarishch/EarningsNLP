Vince?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Vincent Roche</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thanks very much, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Well, I\u2019m very pleased to share that ADI continued to execute exceptionally well in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, despite<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Revenue was $3.25 billion, up 21% year-over-year, strength was broad based with all B2B markets, up single-digits. Gross and operating margins were 74% and 51% respectively and adjusted EPS achieved another record at $2.75.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our continued success is driven by a relentless focus on customer collaboration, a growing demand for our innovative technologies and strong operational execution. We play a long game and are excited about what the future holds for us to ensure that we capture the opportunity ahead. We\u2019ve been steadily increasing investments in R&amp;D, manufacturing capabilities and in partnerships that deepen our value to our customers now and over the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, in R&amp;D, we\u2019ve invested $1.7 billion over the trailing 12 months to strengthen our core franchises and capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers. Over the same period, we\u2019ve invested $760 million in CapEx to enhance the resiliency of our internal semiconductor manufacturing operations. These investments not only increase our operational resiliency, but also modernize our fabs to better address our sustainability ambitions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As mentioned in our press release, our industrial and automotive businesses remain strong as we gain market share. So this morning, I want to focus specifically on our industrial business, which continues to grow significantly despite the macroeconomic backdrop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, from a big picture perspective, the industrial market is the bedrock of ADI, representing more than half of our total revenue. It\u2019s also our most diverse and profitable business segment with tens of thousands of customers and products that sustain revenue streams for decades. Additionally, ADI\u2019s industrial revenue is derived from high performance technology in mission-critical CapEx-intensive equipment across the myriad applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our leadership position has been strengthened over the last decade as we intensified our focus in this market and invested over $5 billion in R&amp;D activities to capture the opportunity across the hundreds of applications that characterize the industrial sector. This space is inherently fragmented and the unmatched breadth and depth of ADI\u2019s portfolio uniquely allows us to address our customer\u2019s needs across the full spectrum of applications. With core component building blocks to application-specific solutions that encompass analog, digital and algorithms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, we\u2019re seeing the rise of new industrial applications that require more sophisticated and more complex architectures as machines become more intelligent and more sustainable. This is driving more semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx, unlocking new opportunities for our portfolio. While this transformation is benefiting all of our industrial applications, including healthcare and aerospace, let me share how we\u2019re winning an industrial automation and instrumentation more specifically and discuss the burgeoning opportunity across the electrification ecosystem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, starting first with industrial automation. Here, our customers are upgrading their factories with more automation and connectivity to increase output with greater energy efficiency. ADI\u2019s broad portfolio helps customers create these more resilient and flexible footprints while lowering their carbon emissions on the journey to net-zero.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As an example, at a leading U.S. robotics manufacturer, we\u2019ve won additional content across power sensing and GMSL connectivity. Our systems approach reduced our customers\u2019 design time and increased our content per cobot by 4x. Also in the last quarter, our IO-Link solution was designed in at multiple leading industrial automation customers. These solutions are critical for delivering robust connectivity to the edge of the factory floor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning our attention now to our instrumentation and test business. This subsector is highly aligned to secular growth trends from connectivity to AI-assisted compute to electrification to drug discovery and gene therapies. The consistent thread across this diverse set of applications is the growing complexity that requires more advanced metrology and test. The results, our average content per system is now 2x to 3x higher. Further, the localization of semiconductor supply is providing additional tailwinds for our test business. We\u2019ve secured multiple design wins in North America as well as Asia for memory and high-performance compute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, on to one of our fastest-growing areas, the electrification ecosystem. The collective need for a more sustainable future is driving massive growth in electrical grid infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let me share two examples with you. First, industrial and automotive companies have announced more than $300 billion of investments in greenfield gigafactories, essential to the production of batteries to proliferate the electrification ecosystem. These gigafactories will drive additional demand for our formation and test solutions critical to producing higher density batteries. Further, given the inherent safety hazards of using higher cell voltages, these factories will also provide new growth vectors for ADI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our sustainable energy franchise, we\u2019re leveraging our industry-leading automotive BMS solutions into energy storage systems for electrical grids and fast-charging infrastructure. We\u2019ve won designs at leading EV infrastructure manufacturers in North America, Europe and Asia, putting us on a path to more than tripling this business in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of course, while no market is fully immune to adverse economic cycles, our industrial business is highly diversified and aligned with secular trends. This has translated to more durable revenue streams with sales in this sector increasing more than 25% over the trailing 12 months despite a weakening economic backdrop. But looking ahead, we see continued strength in this franchise as the breadth and depth of our portfolio, our deep customer collaborations and design win pipeline momentum underpin our new phase of profitable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in closing, ADI\u2019s business model is diverse, resilient and rich with opportunity. I\u2019m very optimistic about what our future holds as we drive enhanced value for our customers employees and shareholders as well as society at large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so with that, I\u2019ll hand you over to Prashanth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today\u2019s press release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter revenue of $3.25 billion finished at the high end of our outlook, driven by continued share gains in industrial and automotive. Our B2B markets represented 89% of revenue, up 25% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially despite our first quarter typically being down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s look at performance by end markets. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market represented 52% of revenue and hit another all-time high. This business has grown sequentially for 12 consecutive quarters. All markets increased year-over-year, led by automation, sustainable energy, instrumentation and test. Automotive, which represented 22% of revenue, also achieved another record, increasing 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. All applications grew double digits year-over-year as our market leading positions across battery management and in-cabin connectivity continue to deliver significant growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Communications, which represented 15% of revenue, grew 18% year-over-year. As expected, comms declined slightly sequentially as strength in wired was offset by softness in wireless due to the timing of 5G deployments. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue, was down 5% year-over-year and declined 14% sequentially given weaker market trends and seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now onto the rest of the P&amp;L. Gross margin of 73.6% expanded 170 basis points year-over-year, unfavorable mix and cost synergies. OpEx was $733 million down slightly sequentially as we balance strategic hiring with the tight discretionary spend and synergy capture. Given our strong operating leverage combined with the synergy savings, our operating margin was 51.1%. Importantly, we have already captured nearly all of the $400 million cost synergy goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As such, our communication will now turn to the revenue synergy opportunities from our combined portfolio and our complimentary customer base with Maxim. Recall that Anelise, our Chief Customer Officer, unveiled how we are strategically approaching these synergies during our Investor Day, and Vince has routinely highlighted some of these compelling opportunities over the past few quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To that end, we are closely monitoring and measuring progress from opportunity to design win to new revenue. And while it is still early, design win momentum to date has exceeded our expectations. This gives us increased confidence in achieving our $1 billion plus revenue synergy opportunity that we outlined at our Investor Day. Non-op expenses were $60 million, and the tax rate was just over 12%. All told, EPS came in at $2.75, up 42% year-over-year and hitting a new record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio below 1. Days of inventory increase to 155, while channel inventory remains below our target level. Recall that last quarter, we outlined our strategy to rebuild strategic die bank and hold more finished goods inventory on our balance sheet as we moderate shipment into the channel during this time of inflection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $176 million and $764 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 6% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx to be high-single-digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then decline in subsequent years to our long-term target of mid-single-digit. These investments will double our internal revenue output exiting next year and support strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies enhances our resiliency and offers our customers additional optionality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $4.3 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Over this period, we have returned $4.7 billion to shareholders or over 100% of free cash flow via $3.1 billion of buybacks and dividends of $1.6 billion. We just raised our quarterly dividend by 13%, marking our fifth consecutive double digit increase, and 19 consecutive years of increases. This is a testament to our durable operating model that has generated positive free cash flow for 26 consecutive years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. The dividend is the cornerstone of this policy, and we look to increase our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with remaining cash used for share count reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, similar to prior quarters, I\u2019d like to give a brief update on the operating backdrop. First, on markets. Industrial orders, as Vince highlighted, remain the strongest followed by automotive, while comms and consumer remain weak. Given the rapidly changing environment, we are diligently working with our customers to remove orders that they may no longer require. At the same time, we have increased our supply by growing our internal output and working with our foundry partners. These actions have reduced our lead times with half of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. Despite this, backlog coverage remains around one year of revenue. As such, we expect our book-to-bill will remain below parody over the next couple quarters as our backlog returns to more normal levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given these dynamics, we are guiding second quarter revenue to be $3.2 billion plus or minus $100 million. We expect continued sequential growth in our industrial and automotive markets and another sequential decline in our communications and consumer markets. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high-single-digits year-over-year with our B2B markets up over 10% once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating margin is expected to be 51% plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is now expected to be between 11% to 13% for the year. This guide reflects the new U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&amp;D expenses for tax purposes, resulting in higher upfront cash tax payments, but lowers our effective tax rate temporarily due to the deferred tax accounting requirements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.75, plus or minus $0.10. In all, the macro backdrop remains uncertain. However, we remain cautiously optimistic on the near-term, given the resilient strength across our industrial and auto businesses, which represent over 75% of our revenue. Longer-term, we remain well positioned to drive growth enabled by our diverse high performance portfolio aligned with the key secular trends at the Intelligent Edge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me now pass it back to Mike for our Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lucarelli</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Prashanth. Let\u2019s go to the Q&amp;A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants in the call this morning. If you have follow-up question, please requeue. I\u2019ll take your question if time allows. With that our first question, please.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C.J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess the \u2013 my question really would center around the industrial strength that you\u2019re seeing. You talked in great detail around kind of emerging new markets as well as increasing content yet, I think a lot of investors are focused on kind of declining PMIs around the globe. And so we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on why your business is, acting so very different from, maybe some of the larger macro trends. And perhaps more color on how much of it is content? How much of it is maybe emerging growth areas that are not reflected in some of these PMIs would be very helpful? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, C.J. So, I think first and foremost, our success isn\u2019t by dent of chance. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in this market for more than a decade, and it\u2019s really our focus. It\u2019s our core, it\u2019s the core of ADI and from both an R&amp;D and customer engagement perspective, we\u2019ve been really doubling down here over this decade plus kind of time span. And we\u2019ve been gaining market share for sure. We have \u2013 compared to even kind of three years, four years ago, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve always had a very strong position in the signal chain, the kind of data path processing electronics, but we\u2019ve been able to, with the acquisitions of LTC and Maxim, we\u2019ve been able to bring very strong competitive power portfolio to bear as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think from a portfolio perspective, we\u2019re in much better shape. I pointed out in the script as well that when we talk about industrial, it\u2019s truly the industrial sector. I know many competitors talk about other kind of indescribable sectors or businesses that are not well understood, like consumer, for example, other consumers. So, I want to point that out as well. We have, as I said, many secular growth drivers in play. We see the average content per dollar of CapEx spend increased at a pretty meaningful level across all the applications, including instrumentation, factory automation is changing also. It\u2019s bringing more sensing, more compute to the edge and all of that is driving content gain for ADI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think they are the primary drivers of the business. And yes, PMIs are, I would say, in the kind of retraction zone right now, but we see stabilization. And I think when China comes back as well, which is likely to happen, we believe, over the coming months, that will drive things even further into a positive zone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">C.J., this is Prashanth. I\u2019ll just put one more thing just to help folks understand kind of the breadth of that growth. All of our submarkets were up double digits year-over-year, and most of them increased quarter-over-quarter. And if you look at it by geography, we had strength in America, Europe and Japan, again, all up double digits year-over-year, offsetting a weaker China. So this industrial strength was very broad-based.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Lucarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, C.J.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a pair of kind of related question, which is how long can book-to-bill remain on before it starts to become, [indiscernible]? And usually, if I look historically for ADI, generally, the second half tends to be better than the first half. What would support that view or prevent that from happening this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Yes. So Vivek, let me maybe take a walk through cancellations, backlog lead times to help answer that. But I do want to clarify, you said on book-to-bill. Our book-to-bill is sub one. I thought I heard you say it was one. Our book-to-bill is sub one. We told you that was happening a couple of months ago, and I\u2019d expect to carry for another quarter or two as we get through this backlog. So on the backlog, we\u2019ve been saying for a while now that we\u2019ve got record backlog, and we are working with our customers and our disti partners to get this rationalized with what customers need today versus perhaps the orders they had placed on us six months or nine months</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ago when we had very long lead time. This progress is what is being reflected in that book-to-bill ratio below one. I think that it will probably be below parity for another quarter or two as we get back to normal backlog.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lead times, the supply-demand imbalance is definitely getting better, slowly, but it\u2019s getting better. We\u2019re getting more wafers externally, thanks to the hybrid model. We have the flexibility to do that as well as the investments we\u2019re making internally as we\u2019ve talked about with our CapEx deployment to increase production. So, we have about 50% of the portfolio under 13 weeks today, meaning it can ship within the quarter, and that\u2019s going to continue to improve over the \u2013 through the second half. So takeaway sort of given lead times falling, bookings getting higher quality compared to year ago as customers aren\u2019t ordering for stuff way into the future. And at the place backlog, and we feel this is positive for visibility, and we\u2019re really getting to true demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And anything on second half, Prashanth, because it looks more like a soft take of then a soft landing from the trends?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I don\u2019t want to go out too far, but I\u2019ll just give you a couple of comments here. And if Vince wants to make any long-term comment. We feel good about the outlook for the second quarter given the resiliency in auto and industrial. As I said, 75% of our sales come from those two segments, and we still have a year for the backlog. Beyond the second quarter, it\u2019s hard on the one hand to make a call, given that we have strong backlog coverage, but we also understand there\u2019s a lot of macro uncertainty out there and things are changing fast. So, I\u2019m not going to make any predictions one area to pay attention to, and Vince made a comment on this, is China. I think we and many companies are watching China. If demand accelerates in the second half given sort of the optimism on consumers and government that would be \u2013 that would be good for a number of organizations. Vince, anything more longer term, you want to add on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think, Prashant, we\u2019ve clearly built a lot of resiliency into the way we run the company into the business model as well as the manufacturing operations. So, who knows what the second half is going to bring. But what I can tell you is that \u2013 we\u2019ve been through many, many cycles before and never have we been better positioned in our history than we are now from a portfolio, from a customer engagement standpoint. So \u2013 this industry is likely \u2013 it\u2019s taken us kind of 20 years to double from kind of 2000 to 2020, we\u2019ve probably doubled the content that the industry builds over the next 10 years. And I believe ADI is very, very well positioned given the strength, as I said, of our portfolio, our customer engagements, and this hybrid manufacturing model that we\u2019ve got in place to enable us to capture the upside and manage the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Lucarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Vivek. Next question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tore Svanberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you and congratulations on the results. So on Maxim now that we\u2019re sort of moving from the cost synergies to the revenue synergies, are there any particular areas that we should keep an eye on there, whether end markets or product categories where you expect to see that $1 billion in synergies?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, let me \u2013 let\u2019s do that in two parts. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of context so that everyone remembers what we talked about and then hand over to Vince. So we\u2019ve closed on the cost synergies. We feel great about that. So we\u2019re focusing now on revenue synergies, and we\u2019re tracking ahead of schedule. We think about that synergy in stages. So first we need to identify the socket, we need to win the socket, we begin shipping to the customer, and then we hit volume. So we are tracking all of those stages through our internal material.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I said, Anelise gave you a target in April to come \u2013 to deliver $1 billion of incremental. Vince is holding her to a higher bar than that. So she\u2019s on track to hit that $1 billion. And we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve seen early success. I think you\u2019ve heard Vince share a couple examples over the last couple quarters. For example, in the \u2013 our ability to cross sell A to B as well as put GMSL into non-auto customers which is new. So let me pass off to Vince here for what are some of the other areas that we\u2019re thinking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. When we announced the combination, Tore, with Maxim, we pointed out two particular market areas where we thought ADI was underweight, where power in particular, power management was really important, power in data center, for example. And as the compute density skyrocket, and in fact in the compute area, performance and power are pretty much one and the same thing. So we have now a very competitive power portfolio that we can bring to more application specific areas such as data center as well as automotive. The \u2013 I think a very positive surprise is that the connectivity portfolio based on GMSL, the multi gig serial link is that not only are we gaining more and more traction in automotive, but also we\u2019re bringing it to other areas such as industrial, as Prashanth mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">BMS, we\u2019ve got 16 of the top 20 wired BMS OEMs sockets in the top 20 OEMs. And Maxim strengthens that portfolio as well. So in industrial, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the I/O link technology is very, very, that Maxim brings to bear is very, very complementary with ADI\u2019s data path solutions. So I think there are multiple areas and I think the message I want to convey here is that I was always optimistic about what we could do with a greater channel, more cross connectivity to the ADI portfolio. But I\u2019m more enthusiastic than ever based on what I\u2019m actually observing now with the various markets and customers in which we\u2019re playing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tore Svanberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Danely</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks guys. Just a little more clarification on the lead times and the shortages. So you mentioned that half of the portfolio has lead times of less than 13 weeks right now. Can you talk about what that was three months ago? And then when would you expect the lead times to, I guess, \u201clargely normalized\u201d and with a couple flat quarters? And it seems like you got plenty of inventory. Why aren\u2019t these lead times normalizing a little bit faster? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Chris let me \u2013 Michael have to remind me where we were three months ago. But the \u2013 so the supply demand balance is getting better. And we\u2019re getting that \u2013 we\u2019re getting more wafers, so \u2013 in addition to our internal production. The way to think about the lead times is we\u2019ve got half the portfolio shipping within the quarter. And certainly in the next quarter or two, we will have the overwhelming majority of that down to within one quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The inventory build as I mentioned, is in part due to our desire to kind of keep more inventory on ADI\u2019s books because we are clearly in a period of great uncertainty and we\u2019re being very mindful of putting too much to our channel partners when there\u2019s this much uncertainty out there. So that will \u2013 as lead times improve, our channel partners can count on us to get what they need in quick terms, and then we\u2019ll be able to more reliably think about what\u2019s the right stocking level for the channel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Lucarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And Chris to your question, where was it beginning the quarter. If you look at that metrics under 13 weeks, beginning of the quarter was probably about 25% of the portfolio. So we doubled that number and Prashanth laid out, we want to get it close to a 100% exiting this year. And I know Vince is pushing hard to get even sooner than that. I think the biggest takeaway at lead times is the short lead times, the more high quality the bookings are. I think that\u2019s what we want to see is the true underlying of what demand is as those lead times continue to come in and why does it take so long while demand is strong, right? Demand is strong, it\u2019s harder to reduce lead times in a strong demand environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Danely</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe it\u2019s a dumb question. But I\u2019m having a little bit of trouble squaring the majority of the portfolio getting to be within 13 weekly times together with a year\u2019s worth of backlog. How do I square those two things? It feels like the backlog should be shorter if the lead times are actually like getting back to normal. Maybe the other way to ask it is when the majority of the portfolio has 13-week lead times, where do you expect that backlog to be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so Stacy, I think perhaps the missing elements of your \u2013 of how you\u2019re thinking about it is the assumption that that backlog is delinquent. It is not. The \u2013 when the lead times get extended, customers put the orders on us, but they also tell us when they want that product delivered. So there\u2019s a visibility curve to that backlog. It is not that it is all past due and needs to be shipped against.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, I see. Okay. So you\u2019re \u2013 okay, so you\u2019ve got orders out. We know that we\u2019re going to be shipping this to you in six months and they placed it [ph]. So I guess where do you expect that backlog to be standing given what you see for demand once, say we\u2019re in a quarter to pass this and the majority of the portfolio is shipping within a quarter. Where do you expect the backlogs to be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, let\u2019s go back to the \u2013 if we get to \u2013 if we return to what was normal for us pre COVID, let\u2019s say that\u2019s the best perspective we can give you. If we return to what does normal look like then at the start of a 13-week quarter, we would have about 10 weeks of that quarter in backlog. And then there would still be some incremental backlog out there for future quarters, but it would be meaningfully smaller because customers know that they can put that order on us in essentially less than a quarter\u2019s notice. So that\u2019s what normal looks like. Now, given the supply, demand challenges and the increasing importance of Analog\u2019s products to our customers, we may benefit from some greater visibility in the future, but I don\u2019t want to call that today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. So I guess, does this mean, are you effectively over shipping demand right now because the backlog is pulling it? Or is that not the right way to think about it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I would \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how you would conclude that. We are \u2013 we have the \u2013 we have demand from our customers in that backlog that tells us. I want this product in Q1, I want this product in Q2, this product in Q3, and that is what we are matching up for. But it gives us a visibility that we have historically not had at this level. That is why they are not as incentive to put new orders on us, is because they\u2019ve given us those orders, hence book to bill below one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. One other thing we\u2019re pointing out, Stacy, is that we run \u2013 our demand signals are sell through. We run our factories on the basis of POS demand rather than sell in or POA demand. So it gives us more integrity around the demand signal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I won\u2019t monopolize anymore. Thank you so much, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Lucarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Stacy, for that three part question. You use your question for next quarter, so we\u2019re not going to \u2013 have the call next quarter. Next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ambrish Srivastava</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thank you. I\u2019m going to keep it to one. Mike, I don\u2019t want to get any of bad site. Vince, I actually wanted to focus on a bit on the long-term here. I was called out a much higher growth rate for analog and for themselves as a result. And I was wondering if you share the same view, I know you guys have had a 7% to 10%, and Vince you have always all the conversations over the years, you always felt that the analog industry going forward should grow faster than the 5.6 odd that we\u2019ve seen over the long-term. So I was just wondering how you think about analog growth and you called out a bunch of secular drivers that, four or five years ago didn\u2019t even exist for the analog industry and broadly for semis. Thank you, Vince.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks, Ambrish. Well, I think, as I pointed out in the prepared remarks, we are seeing more, for example, in the industrial space, more content per dollar of CapEx invested by our customers. And that trend has been in play for several years now. That coupled with ADI\u2019s portfolio strength, the breadth we have the, as I mentioned, the data path, which has been ADI core, ADI traditional strength, adding LTC and Maxim Power portfolios. That gives us the opportunity to tap into more of the TAM, so to speak. Half of the analog market, TAM is kind of data path. The other half is power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019ve now got the, the highest performance portfolio in the industry, the greatest breadth and depth. And, when you see what\u2019s happening there with healthcare, our digital healthcare business, which is getting on for, kind of a $1 billion over the next year, year and a half aerospace and defense, coupled with automation and instrumentation that we\u2019ve talked about in the prepared remarks. We\u2019re very, very bullish about our ability to drive growth in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other thing I want to point out is that we focus on driving our revenue growth through high quality innovation for which we get paid. We get three times the ASPs of the analog market at large, and we get more than that, compared to our biggest competitor. So I want to make the point that we focus on shipping value versus volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think with the sector growth drivers, the way we\u2019ve structured our business model, our focus on high performance and being able to capture more value with all the things we talked about over the course of the call here, I\u2019m focused on what we can do as a company and I believe we\u2019re better positioned than ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ambrish, Prashanth, maybe just a just two things to add. First our long-term growth model is built on all of our segments. So industrial certainly is an important, very, very important part of it. But we look for all of our operating segments to be able to contribute to that. We\u2019ve had two consecutive record years with greater than 20% growth. And with the numbers that we\u2019ve shared today, we\u2019re off to a strong start for 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our 7% to 10% CAGR outlook, which we revealed, unveiled last April, already reflected a faster growth versus sort of the historical mid-single digit rate. And as we said in the prepared remarks, as well as in addressing, I think it was Tore\u2019s question we have a, we have meaningful delta with the revenue synergies from Maxim, which is really idiosyncratic to the ADI story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I just want to add one final comment to this, just want to add one final comment Ambrish, to this part of the conversation, I\u2019ve had innumerable conversations with CEOs across the globe over the last three years in particular, it\u2019s certainly intensified with the crunch on supply. But I got two consistent questions from them. Irrespective of what sector they\u2019re in, how can we get closer to ADI\u2019s longer term technology roadmap, and also how do we bond together more tightly when it comes to understanding supply chain and collaborating more together across those two dimensions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s the sentiment and I think given the way we\u2019ve conducted ourselves over the last the last three years we\u2019ve, we\u2019re better positioned. Our brand is has been augmented and strengthened over the last several years. So yes, I think we\u2019ve got a lot of strong logic as to why the market will strengthen and why ADI will be better positioned than ever to capture the opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Ambrish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ambrish Srivastava</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. I don\u2019t want to get on mics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Lucarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not a bad side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Vincent Roche</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last question?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Lucarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. There\u2019s second half uncertainty as you mentioned, probably more so in your comms and consumer businesses, maybe a little bit in industrial due to the soft PMIs as was mentioned earlier. But global auto demand trends, especially EVs remains pretty resilient, right? And you guys have a strong design wind portfolio and automotive that is starting to unfold. I know last earnings call, last month at CES, the team remained pretty confident on growing your automotive business this year by double-digit percentage on a flattish, sort of SARs. So, if you look at some of the third party research, I mean, SARs is forecasted to grow 2% to 3% this year. So is the team still confident on driving strong double-digit percentage growth profile this fiscal year on auto?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Harlan. Yes. So if we look at our outperformance versus SAR, it comes down to a couple items. First, as you mentioned, there\u2019s a mix of premium cars, so higher content per vehicle and EV growth is accelerating. And our content is 3x as high on an EV versus a traditional ICE car. We\u2019ve spoken at length that we\u2019ve got real key content adders, our BMS product, our GMSL and our A2B are adopted and they\u2019re really taking meaningful market share across all of our customer base there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think because of the performance that we bring to our customers, we\u2019re able to capture value better than perhaps some others. So with those three working, we\u2019re, we still feel pretty good that that we\u2019re going to continue to have a, 2x to 3x multiplier on SAR. So I don\u2019t want to make a prediction as to what SAR is. So you\u2019ve got a, I think IHS has a mid-single digit number, a lower mid-single digit number out there. But we\u2019re for the year, I expect us to kind of be 2x to 3x wherever that lands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Insightful. Thank you, Prashanth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lucarelli</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Harlan, and thanks everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Two quick ones before I let you guys go. Our next earnings call will be held a week later than normal, as Vince was asked to give a keynote at IMAX Technology World Forum. So do not panic when we see your announcement. The earning is not two and a half weeks after closed, but three and a half weeks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, we\u2019re planning to restart our ADI on coverage series where we do a deep dive into a market in the coming months. The first one will be on some of the topics we hit on today, automation, energy efficiency, sustainability, electrification. So stay tuned for those.
