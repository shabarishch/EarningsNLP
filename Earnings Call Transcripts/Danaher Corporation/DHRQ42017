Before we get in to the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to touch briefly on the announcement we made this morning regarding our CFO transition plan. As I\u2019m sure many of you saw, we announced that Matt McGrew, our current Group CFO of our diagnostics and dental platforms will succeed Dan Comas as Chief Financial Officer of Danaher on January 1 of 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dan will continue on as an Executive Vice President and a member of the office of the Chief Executive post January 1, 2019, as he begins a gradual transition to retirement. Dan, it goes without saying that it has been and will continue to be a privilege working with you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the past 27 years, all of us at Danaher have valued your outstanding financial stewardship, thoughtful guidance and longtime friendship. Danaher would not be where it is today without your leadership, strategic vision, and humility. We are also very pleased that you\u2019ll continue to work with us post-2018 to ensure a seamless CFO transition and provide a strategic counsel we value so highly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Many of you know Matt McGrew from his time as Vice President of Investor Relations. But Matt has had a number of important roles during his past 14 years with Danaher. Matt is uniquely qualified to take on the positon of CFO, as he will be able to leverage his extensive Danaher experience in internal audit, M&amp;A, investor relations and as Group CFO with operational experience across four of our five platforms. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Throughout his tenure with Danaher, Matt has consistently demonstrated superior leadership and played an integral role in the company\u2019s growth both organically and inorganically. We look forward to helping Matt transition to this important role with Dan\u2019s guidance and strategic counsel. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that lets\u2019 get to our results. We are very pleased with our strong fourth quarter performance, as the team delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, solid margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. These results capped a solid year for Danaher and we\u2019re very encouraged by the momentum we built throughout 2017. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2017 was a great example of how we run the Danaher playbook. We improved gross margins to nearly 56%, lowered G&amp;A, increased our investments in sales and marketing and R&amp;D to drive accelerating core growth, all while delivering 70 basis points of core operating margin expansion. This operating model continues to demonstrate how we build a better, stronger Danaher. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, our differentiated portfolio, organic growth investments and good commercial execution helped drive 3.5% core revenue growth, including mid-single digit growth in three out of our four reporting segments. Our total annual revenues are now nearly $18.5 billion. We generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow in 2017, resulting in mid-teens growth year-on-year that helps position us for more significant capital deployment in 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our free cash-to-net income conversion ratio was 117%, and 2017 represents the 26<sup>th</sup> consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. From an M&amp;A perspective, we deployed nearly $400 million of capital in 2017 on 10 strategic bolt-on acquisitions, each of which will help enhance their respective platforms. We also remain encouraged by the great performance at our most recently acquired larger businesses, Cepheid, Phenomenex, PALL and Nobel Biocare. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 11% to $5.1 billion, as the impact of currency translation increased revenue by 3% and acquisitions increased revenues by 2.5%. Core revenue increased 5.5%, led by four of our five platforms that grew between 5.5% and 7.5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Geographically high growth markets grew high single digits with China and India continuing to lead the way. In developed markets, we saw acceleration as both the US and Western Europe were up mid-single digits. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 55.8%, an increase of 130 basis points, while core operating margin expanded 105 basis points led by our life sciences and diagnostics platforms. These margin results are a testament to our teams\u2019 consistent execution using the tools of the Danaher business system. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.19, bringing full year adjusted EPS to $4.03 both representing double digit growth year-on-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue was up 12% and core revenue grew 7.5%, which marks the platforms highest quarterly core growth rate in over four years. Life sciences operating profit margin was 20%, with both core and reported operating margins increasing over 300 basis points. This increase was broad based across the platform driven primarily by outstanding DBS execution, new product innovations and better than expected topline performance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beckman Life Sciences delivered high single digit core revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, led by ongoing strong performance in our Flow Cytometry and particle counting businesses. We believe the Beckman team continues to take market share driven by improved commercial execution and new product innovations. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past three years, Beckman has refreshed its portfolio launching approximately 20 new products. Several of these new products address higher growth areas such as biologic and genomic work flows, setting the business up well for continued strong performance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Leica Microsystem\u2019s core revenue was up low single digits, led by growth in Western Europe and China, primarily in the medical and research end markets. Core revenue at Sciex increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by continued strength in the food, environmental and pharmaceutical end markets. In addition, Phenomenex had a very good quarter, growing core revenue high single digits as both Sciex and Phenomenex are starting to leverage each other\u2019s go-to-market capabilities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Pall, core revenue grew nearly 10%, its best quarterly growth rate since we acquired the business as our microelectronics and single use technologies businesses continued to perform very well. In addition, biopharma and process and industrial finished the year on a strong note, as these businesses rebounded nicely from the hurricane disruptions that impacted third quarter results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In October, our life sciences platform successfully closed the acquisition of IDBS, a software informatics leader in the life science space. IDBS\u2019s software provides a data management platform enabling its research customers to better capture, manage and report on scientific insights. This platform in combination with our life sciences instrumentation will enable researches to accelerate their innovation efforts helping to make better and faster scientific decisions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving now to diagnostics, reported revenues increased 13.5% and core revenue increased 6%. Core operating margin grew by 105 basis points and reported operating margin increased 690 basis points to 19.5%. At Beckman Coulter, core revenue grew at low single digit rate led by solid growth in our immunoassay, urinalysis and clinical chemistry product lines. Regionally the growth was driven by China and Latin America. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Radiometer, core revenue increased mid-single digits in the quarter, as both our blood gas and AQT product lines continued to perform well. Leica Biosystems delivered high single digit core revenue growth, led by increased demand in both our advanced staining and core histology product lines. Growth was broad based across most regions, with particular strength in North America and Western Europe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Cepheid, the team had an outstanding quarter. Core revenue increased greater than 25% driven by growth in all major product lines and geographies. For the full year 2017, Cepheid\u2019s core revenue grew approximately 20%, which is almost double the expected rate from when we announced the acquisition. This outperformance was driven by a combination of strong commercial execution, test menu expansion and an ever increasing installed base of instruments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall it was a tremendous first year at Cepheid, with DBS helping to deliver improvements across the company. Since we acquired the business last November, Cepheid has achieved 400 basis points of gross margin expansion, increased operating margins from just above breakeven in to the mid-teens and improved on-time delivery by over 1500 basis points. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The team has also meaningfully embraced two key commercial DBS growth tools, transformative marketing and funnel management. These tools have helped Cepheid expand its market visibility, generate more potential leads and increase the number of new customers they are serving. As a result, we believe Cepheid continues to expand its leading market position and gain market share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our dental segment, reported revenue increased 2.5% and core revenue was down slightly. Dental operating profit margin was 13.1% as both core and reported operating margins declined. By product line, performance was in line with our expectations. Growth in our specialty consumables businesses, implants and orthodontics was offset by declines in equipment and traditional consumables. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As expected the declines in traditional consumable growth rate has started to moderate, however, our equipment business was negatively impacted by the recent realignment of certain distributor and manufacture relationships. We anticipate these difficult market conditions to persist through the first half of 2018. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to be pleased with the performance in our specialty consumables businesses. Nobel Biocare in particular had a great quarter, growing core revenue high single digits driven by North America and China. December marked the three-year anniversary of the Nobel acquisition, and they\u2019ve made tremendous progress. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not only has the team meaningfully improved operating margins, but has also increased R&amp;D spend by approximately 20%, launched more than 25 new products and increased their sales force by 15% over the past two years. These growth initiatives along with the execution of DBS tools to streamline sales from our proxies and increase new customer starts has helped Nobel pose mid-single digit core growth in each of the last two years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving now to our environmental and applied solutions segment, reported revenue grew 12.5% with core revenue up 6%. Core operating margin declined by 50 basis points and reported operating margin decreased to 23.1%, driven primarily by increased productivity initiatives and a deafening spend within our water quality platform. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In product identification, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by strong demand from marking and coating equipment and related consumables. The out-growth in our packaging and color solutions offerings was attributed to increased demand in North America and Western Europe. Videojet core revenue increased high single digits in the quarter, with broad based growth across most major product lines and geographies. The fourth quarter capped off another great year for Videojet as the business continued to compound returns and gain market share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past five years, Videojet has averaged mid-single digit core revenue growth, continued to expand margins and also completed a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions. One of those acquisitions Laetus had its best quarter of core revenue growth since we acquired the business in 2015. As a reminder Laetus is a leading supplier of track and trade inspection systems for pharmaceutical packaging plants. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With the help of DBS tools Laetus has generated greater market awareness and demand within the pharmaceutical tracking vertical and we believe is well positioned for growth going forward. In our packaging and color solutions businesses, core revenue at Esko was up mid-single digits, while X-Rite was up low-single digits. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, turning to our quality, core revenue growth for the platform at a mid-single digit rate. Hach had its best quarter of the year, with core revenue growing mid-single digits. This growth was drive by solid performance across our core municipal and industrial end markets, with strength in Western Europe and China. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hach also continued its healthy cadence of Bolton acquisitions, closing two deals in the quarter, AppliTek and Kipp &amp; Zonen. AppliTek is a leading provider of wet chemistry process analyzers and integrated systems that will help Hach offer a broader suite of parameters to its core industrial and municipal customers. Kipp &amp; Zonen specializes in making instrumentation that\u2019s relied upon by meteorologist through applications such as climate research, water resource management and materials testing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Kipp &amp; Zonen will join Hach\u2019s environmental business and nicely complement our existing offerings, providing us an opportunity to deliver enhanced customer solutions. We are excited to welcome both teams to Danaher. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Chemtreat, core revenue grew at a low single digit rate, driven by increases in the food, steel and oil and gas end markets, primarily in North America. It\u2019s worth noting that 2017 marks Chemtreat\u2019s 50<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of revenue growth, a tremendous accomplishment and a testament to the team\u2019s commitment to continue its improvement and their best-in-class commercial execution. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, Trojan had a great quarter delivering double digit core growth, driven by healthy demand and increased bidding activity in the North American municipal market. Trojan continues to execute very well significantly improving customer win rates to help drive share gains relative to its markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to wrap up, we\u2019re very pleased with our fourth quarter results, capping off a good year for Danaher and helping to build momentum as we start 2018. In 2017, the team delivered double digit adjusted EPS growth; meaningful margin improvement and cash flow generation and saw core revenue growth accelerate through the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also executed on a number of strategic Bolton acquisitions, continued to focus on integration of our recent larger deals and we now have a balance sheet that positions us well for a more significant capital deployment in 2018. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look ahead, we believe that the strength of our portfolio, combined with the power of the Danaher business system provide us with the foundation to achieve long term shareholder value creation. We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $0.90 and $0.93, which assumer core growth of 3.5% to 4%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to expect full year 2018 core revenue growth of 3.5% to 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.25 and $4.35. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Gugino</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Tracey, we are now ready for questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Scott Davis with Melius Research. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s step back just a bit, the step up in core growth was pretty exceptional really, but can you walk us around the world, I wasn\u2019t clear where the positive surprises came from globally. By business it was clear, but let\u2019s clear globally. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Scott it was really very positive on a global basis. Of course I think we all know from a macro perspective we\u2019re in a unique time, right, we\u2019re in a time of globally synchronous economic expansion. And I think in many respects our businesses are well positioned to take advantage of that growth rate on a global basis across all the many markets in which we participate. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we saw in the fourth quarter was continued good performance in the high growth markets, with exceptional growth in China, in India, as we\u2019d seen consistently throughout the course of the year, some improving performance in places like Latin America and Russia, and frankly still some softness in places like the Middle East. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think what was maybe a bit more noteworthy than the continued good performance in the high growth markets was the incremental strength that we saw in the developed markets. In the US and in Europe both of those markets up mid-single digits is I think where the real difference is on a global basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now clearly our businesses were well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in each of those markets. We saw obviously particular strength in our life science businesses and our diagnostic businesses, up north of 7% and 6% respectively, improved performance sequentially in our water quality business which we expected, and consistent performance in product identification. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think overall pretty well in line with what\u2019s happening in the macro from a geographic perspective, but I think clearly four to five platforms incredibly well positioned relative to those macro drivers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that just begs the natural question of when you think about your guidance 3.5% to 4%. That first half of the year you\u2019ve got reasonably easy comps and you made positive comments about the global macro. Is there something you\u2019ve seen January that leads to be a little bit more conservative or is this just the standard Danaher, it\u2019s still early in the year, let\u2019s wait and see before we raise that guidance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s anything in particular that we\u2019ve seen on a near-term basis Scott. I think it\u2019s much more to the latter point you made, which is it\u2019s very early in the year. We are encouraged by obviously the finish we saw. What little we\u2019ve seen of January to this point gives us encouragement as well. And I think it\u2019s just early at this point and obviously we\u2019ll be updating throughout the course of the year. But I think for now we feel very good about the guidance that we have and we\u2019ll watch carefully as this quarter unfolds. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll go next to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Question on in terms of the delta relative to our model life science certainly stood out. You called out Beckman life science, Phenomenex. Can you quantify what Pall life sciences was up and then was there any catchup affect from 3Q there that you can quantify and any budget flush dynamic that you\u2019re willing to call out. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So our best stance was the life science was up 7.5%, there was probably about a point benefit, kind of a hurricane recovery, so call it ex hurricane recovery more like 6.5%. That was also followed through with very strong orders. We were I think as we went into the beginning in January slightly worried that there were some budget flush, but our January orders have remained very strong. That\u2019s not only life science but more broadly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then a question on Cepheid, obviously this has done incredibly well. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on how much of this is coming from new cartridge launches versus flu trends versus [HVDC][ph] and some of these other markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw a really broad based strong performance from Cepheid. There were a number of factors that I think contributed to that. Not the least of which certainly was enhanced commercial execution. One of the things we tracked at Cepheid is our installed base and our new customer addition, and since we\u2019ve acquired the business, new customer additions are plus 15% since we acquired the business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think menu is certainly a contributor with Xpress flu, with Flu/RSV, with strep test all introduced in 2017, all making a difference. Yes, continued strength in the hybrid in developing countries but very good strength in the developed markets as well. Clearly we are in the midst of at least certainly from a patient perspective a very challenging flu season. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And yes that does drive growth at Cepheid. But I think if you step back and you look at the performance in the fourth quarter, that performance is driven far beyond the early strength of the flu season and really represents I think a number of both commercial execution enhancement and menu expansions that have driven growth in the installed base. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll go next to Ross Muken with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Muken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe on dental right, some of the underlying trends particularly in the recently acquired business and Nobel seems better, but obviously some of the noise still exist with the channel and maybe on sort of basic consumables. I guess based on what you\u2019ve seen kind of closing the year to start of the year. I mean in terms of cadence and in terms of your thoughts on how some of the changes you\u2019ve made over time are starting to playout and the pieces where you\u2019ve been able to influence it versus maybe some of the market factors you don\u2019t have control on. And what\u2019s your sort of updated thoughts on how that\u2019s gone and in terms of maybe some of the small wins it seems like you\u2019re getting in pieces like Nobel. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The fourth quarter played out pretty much in line with what we expected. I think we all know that 2017 was clearly a difficult year in the industry. But there are a number of things that actually are quite encouraging for us. Starting with especially consumables business, I mentioned in my comments earlier the terrific performance that we\u2019ve seen in Nobel. We\u2019ve seen very consistent and good performance from Ormco as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And those two businesses especially consumables businesses represent half our dental segment. Mid-single digit growth across that group of businesses combined in the fourth quarter with Nobel being high single digits, and there\u2019s no question I think those are some pretty attractive markets to participate in. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could the strength there be taken a little bit of wallet share from some of the more traditional consumables, maybe a little bit tough to pinpoint on that, but in general that half of our segment we were quite encouraged by? High growth markets have continued to perform very well, high single digit growth in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then operational execution, you know we\u2019ve talked in the past and I think we\u2019ve just finished up our second year of talking about our dental platform, approaching the dental platform as a new acquisition. And we\u2019ve done a number of things to right size the cost structure while we invest in over the last couple of years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We consolidated operating companies from 10 down to four, reduced the manufacturing and back office sites by over nearly a third. Gross margins are up a 100 basis points as a result of a number of those changes and yet we\u2019re still reinvesting. R&amp;D up a 100 basis points as a percent of sales, up 20% in 2017 year-on-year, a whole bunch of new products, 25 new products as I mentioned in Nobel. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is a $3 billion platform we have today and admittedly that doesn\u2019t represent an enormous percentage of Danaher and clearly where we\u2019ve seen the weakness in about half of that platform isn\u2019t even a smaller percentage of the overall platform. But these are strong brands and great franchises. Good secular trends around digital dentistry and so on and over all we feel good about the operational improvements and the progress we\u2019re making and we continue to drive to create long term value out of that platform. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Muken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s super helpful and maybe just on the capital allocation front. So you guys free cash continues to be a really tremendous 100% plus of net income. I guess as you\u2019re staring out over the balance of the year, it looks like the leverage levels are going to get back because of manageable place. How are you balancing kind of your balance sheet capacity versus public market multiples, looks like you were a little bit busy on the tuck-in side in the last quarter or two. So help us just think through kind of how that environment looks like for you right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We feel very good about where we sit today Ross. The 10 acquisitions that we did in the past year were strategic enhancements to a number of our platforms, and the spend that we executed during the course of the year was certainly within the range of the spend that we anticipated during the course of the year, particularly in light of the capital deployment that had preceded that over the couple of years of \u201915 and \u201916.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we enter 2018, as I mentioned, I think the balance sheet\u2019s in great shape. It positions us now to take advantage of opportunities as they come along. Optimally we would deploy that capital at or above our free cash flow and for deals that really are strategically important to anyone of our platforms today, we\u2019d be willing to stretch that a bit. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we feel great about how we enter the year. We\u2019ve seen activity pick up a little bit. Second half of the year you saw a little bit more activity in those boltons in the first half of the year, and I think that bodes well for how things might open up here with people feeling good about their own valuations clearly as sellers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think it\u2019s also probably worth noting that now the tax reform has been determined, if you will. That pays a level of uncertainty out of the market, and anytime you eliminate uncertainty, confidence grows and that may help things out as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Winoker with UBS. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Winoker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dan could you maybe give a little more color on the puts and takes around the gross margin, 130 basis points. Obviously you guys are less sensitive in your cost structure to material inflation than a lot of other companies. But maybe just talk about the price productivity mix impact versus other headwinds. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re right. I mean all up a big part of the driver is the continued expansion of gross margins at Pall. It\u2019s obviously been a multi-year effort. The big step-up, the 400 basis points step up in gross margin at Cepheid is year-on-year are probably the two biggest drivers. We had a 55% gross margin; we just don\u2019t have that much impact from sort of commodities and direct labor inflation. It\u2019s a little bit of a headwind right now, but at t hose levels it\u2019s relatively modest. And clearly when you\u2019re putting together 5.5% core growth, you get very good fall through including on the gross margin side. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Winoker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so you expect that to continue?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, probably not at the \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get another 400 basis points step up at Cepheid next year in gross margin, but I think we\u2019re very well positioned from gross margin. And I think as we saw on the operating margin side, as many of you\u2019ll remember, we had negative OMX, core OMX in the first quarter of this year and we still ended up at the high end of our range of 50 to 75 basis points of core margin expansion. I feel very good about how we are set up in terms of core margin falling in to \u201918 including some of the actions we took in the latter part of \u201917. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Winoker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then maybe just talk through a little more of the margin dynamics gotten it down 50 basis points at Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, that was primarily a couple of different factors, Trojan being very strong, a little bit of a negative mix. But the water business particularly Hach came to us kind of early in the fourth quarter with some opportunities both on the growth side and on the cost side to take some actions. It was clear we were having a very good quarter. We let them execute upon those actions both top and bottom line. You did see their growth accelerate. I just saw it for January they had a very strong start to the year. So I think some of their growth investments are still paying off pretty quickly here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m not concerned. A fair amount of it was kind of orchestrated through the course, given the strength we had. And again we\u2019re not going to have the uplift we have in that segment that we will continue to have in diagnostics and dental. But I think you\u2019ll see more normalized margin improvement across those businesses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And [PID] had a very good quarter in terms of year, in terms of margins. And I think you\u2019ll see water sort of back on track here starting earlier this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll next go to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple of things, just back to tax reform, you guys obviously do a fair amount of boltons and just looking at this provision on deals that are structured as asset deals where you can get immediate expensing of the fixed assets of the target company. I just wondered if you could give us a little context from a Danaher standpoint. On a lot of your bolton deals, typically asset deals and you have the ability to structure them that way, and kind of change the economic lunge you\u2019re looking through when you look at these properties. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff there\u2019s always been an advantage to acquire the assets as oppose to the stock of an entity, perhaps even more so now. I would say that we\u2019re sort of incrementally encouraged versus where we were two months ago generally wrapped around tax reform. We said in December we thought our rate would be 21%. I think it will be probably close to 20% to 21% this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We talked about a toll tax being probably in the magnitude of 100 million a year for the next five years. We now think it\u2019s going to be more like 50 million to 60 million. So it\u2019s still like sort of incrementally, and finally to your point, as often been the case, often with acquisitions particularly asset acquisitions there is an opportunity to do even more tax work to potentially lower that ETR even more overtime. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the investment spend in Environmental and Applied, just wondering is that kind of traditional or restructuring or you\u2019re doing something further drive growth. Obviously the tempo when the business seems like its quite strong, I guess there\u2019s always some belt tightening to do around the edges. But is this more growth oriented or is it more restructuring oriented?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s little bit of both, more growth oriented, Hach adding both on the R&amp;D side and the feet on the street side. We\u2019re seeing very good numbers on the municipal and the industrial side, they actually got better through the year and we gave some latitude to ramp it up even more in Q4. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then finally just on the distributor realignment in dental. Are we just now kind of working through the comparisons associated with the growth realignment that happened in the last several months or so, six months or so, maybe it\u2019s longer than that? And so we\u2019re just kind of working through the annualization of these dynamics or is there still somethings shifting around in the business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jeff those relationships changed in a formal way at the beginning last year. So we\u2019re about four or five months in two what is a shift in largely exclusive arrangements that involved our relationship with Henry Schein and Dentsply Sirona\u2019s relationship with Patterson. Essentially changing places in terms of a number of equipment related product line particularly around imaging. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When that sort of thing happens, there\u2019s a series of adjustments that need to be made. Some of that comes in the form of inventory, some of that comes in the form of actually sell-out that is associated with sales team, learnings new products, shifting incentives etcetera which can further, along with the inventory adjustment have an impact on sell-in. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s a series of factors that come together that does take a number of months to work its way through the system. At the end of the day the market becomes a little more of a level playing field when you have less exclusive arrangements between manufacturers and distributors. We believe that it will still take better part of the first half of this year for those adjustments to work their way through the system. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the meantime, we are encouraged by seeing the traditional consumable side, which has been challenged as well moderate a bit in the fourth quarter. We take that altogether and we still think our dental business is likely to be flattish in the first half of this year with the specially tool of business is continuing to perform quite well, the high growth markets continue to perform quite well and much of the operational improvement that we\u2019re putting in place continuing to improve profitability. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derik De Bruin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just got a couple, one quick one and then one follow-up. So net interest expense, interest expense, so what\u2019s the guide for \u201918 could you remind me?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">145 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derik De Bruin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And could you talk a little bit about pharma demand. I mean we\u2019re starting to see some big companies talking about increasing their capital allocations and spending. Could you sort of talk about what you sort of see in the pharma space and sort of order pick-ups in that area on the equipment side or what\u2019s on the bio process side? I\u2019m wondering if some of the stuff you\u2019re seeing directly weighted to some of the commentary that we\u2019re hearing on them stepping up on those spend. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We feel good about the overall pharma market today, not just in bio-processing, in biologic demand pharma demand, but across more molecules as well. And we would point to the continued good performance in our equipment businesses at Sciex, at Beckman Life Science, at Phenomenex, at Leica Microsystem. Each of those businesses on the equipment side continuing to perform very well, and not all of those businesses have a significant exposure to the biologic side of life science or certainly pharma as we do say at Pall, where by the way we saw some improved performance clearly in the fourth quarter, obviously not all a function of the recovery from the third quarter hurricane disruptions but in fact we saw good order rate trends around biologic and small molecules, good order rate trend around our single use technologies as well. So on balance I would say, the overall pharma market, biologics and small molecules combined continues to be in pretty good shape. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derik De Bruin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the diagnostics side, any possible CapEx or any PAMA blow back?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not really. Derik, again early relative to PAMA those rates as you know are just going in to place. As I mentioned previously, our exposure there is relatively modest with 60%of our volume outside the United States, this being only a US impact and limited to Medicare reimbursements for outpatient spending which again further mitigates the impact on us. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s certainly reasonable to think that customers will leverage the reduction and reimbursement associated with PAMA more broadly, but then again, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily anything new. I think anytime there are competitive dynamics in a market like the diagnostics market certainly in the central lab there\u2019s going to be some pricing pressure, PAMA will create a little bit of an additional rationale for that. But on a fact basis the exposure there, again US only hospital outpatient and Medicare reimbursement would suggest it\u2019s relatively modest. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll go next to Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Beuchaw</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question is a geographic focused question, because you talked a fair amount here on this call about the developed markets. I wonder if you could spend just a minute or two on China as it didn\u2019t get as much attention on the call. Where in China do you think that we have a particularly good \u201918; how are things evolving there; where in China, given some of the liquidity news items out there should we maybe budget in, something that is a little bit moderate relative to \u201917.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steve, China has been an important growth driver for us for a number of years. Today we do, I think in excess of $2 billion of revenue in China. We\u2019ve strong positions across each of the platforms and there are extraordinary secular market drivers in China that support our water quality platform with the environmental concerns in China. Product ID even with the growth of the middle class and consumer package goods, diagnostics and life science both receiving significant amount of investment from the Chinese government. And as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times, our dental business continues to grow high single digits and in certain quarters double digits pretty consistently in China. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think if you step back, it\u2019s a boy this is a portfolio that really lines up well with a number of key growth drivers in the Chinese market. In terms of any changes, you have the impact of a relatively new five year plan in China. Again I think that\u2019s going to be supportive broadly across most of our platforms, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a change there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in general we feel pretty good about continuing contributions from the Chinese market in each one of the platforms. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the things that was encouraging in China was we were up double digit for the year and we were basically 10%-11% every quarter through 2017. So it feels like we have pretty good momentum. It\u2019s a bigger base now for that kick down a point or two share, but things are still feeling pretty good over there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Beuchaw</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good to hear. One more of a big picture question for Tom, it\u2019s hard not to look at the improvement of organic growth to your core growth in the last couple of quarter, and here the really encouraging commentary on new product flow and execution across the businesses and think, hey vow these guys are seeing some step up in R&amp;D, step up in commercial investment, really pay-off. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It will be helpful just to hear what you\u2019ve learned and how this success, the way I perceive it as a success downstream of an investment effort. How is that changing your thinking if at all about the medium or long term, appropriate level of spend on R&amp;D and sales and marketing in the organization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well clearly this has been an evolution for us. Part of that evolution Steve is the evolution of the portfolio. Many of the changes that we\u2019ve made in the portfolio over quite a number of years not just in the last two years or so, but really over the last probably better than five years has set up a portfolio that is really aligned to markets that have a great growth drivers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think secondly, we\u2019ve seen an evolution in the Danaher business system, as the tools of DBS have evolved beyond lean in to leadership and most importantly in to growth, and we see the tools of DBS which by the way continued to evolve. Even in 2017, we developed incremental growth tools that are having an impact on each of our businesses from a commercial execution perspective, but also in terms of driving higher rates of innovation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think finally on innovation, I think it has and will continue to play an increasingly important role in our growth rates. And those investments in R&amp;D have paid off and we can point to a number of those examples in our businesses where we see new products from incrementing their growth rates. I point specifically for example the Videojet whose got probably the most robust new product pipeline in its history today with the 1860 fully censored and wired to the internet through greater levels of customer services, Hach\u2019s launch of the [Claro] system leveraging the internet of things as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think the portfolio evolution, the evolution of the tools on the Danaher business system, continued investment in R&amp;D to drive higher rates of innovation, and then finally inorganically obviously the deals we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years have been incremental to our growth rates. You clearly look at the impact of Cepheid and Phenomenex our most recent acquisitions, but certainly Pall and Nobel having an impact. And those 10 strategic Bolton acquisitions, each of those have strategic impacts on our businesses and the ability to drive incremental growth over time through what at times is kind of early stage investment that can drive long term innovation related growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s really a combination of things, having learned a lot in the process. Certainly we have, but I think that learning has come really as a function of executing a plan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll next to Richard Eastman with Baird. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Eastman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could we just circle back if you will to the life sciences up margin here in the quarter, and maybe just speak a little bit to Pall, the strength that Pall and the impact of mix on that up margin. I\u2019m curious, Dan you flagged Pall\u2019s gross margin improvement as a big factor in overall margin improvement and expansion. But could you maybe just give us a sense to Pall\u2019s gross margin improvement during and for the full year in calendar \u201917.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know Rick when we purchased the business it was a high-teens [OP][ph] business and we\u2019re up a 1000 basis points since the time of the acquisition, and a big chunk of that has been [indiscernible] in the gross margin. I would say that, but one thing that was encouraging in the quarter, was the gross margin improvement in life science is pretty broad based. And none of the businesses grew mid-single digits. Beck life sciences improved their gross margin and then turned their operating margins; we\u2019re seeing the same thing as Sciex good margin expansion. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Though I noted Pall the big driver of the life science improvement. It was this broad based particularly to put up that sort of number as I\u2019ve seen it, and clearly the better core growth helps. Though all those businesses are doing a good job expanding the growth margins, leveraging G&amp;A, they are off stepping up their R&amp;D in sales and marketing. So we\u2019re getting those margins step up. Back to Tom\u2019s point about investing and grow while stepping up our growth investment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Eastman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again when you look at the out margin here, for the fourth quarter assuming Pall, both Pall life sciences as well as PI were stepped up and rebounded, how do you look at the gross margin in the fourth quarter here is maybe a new structural level here to grow off and leverage off with core growth going forward for life sciences?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dan Comas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Rick I\u2019d have to look at them more carefully. As you know there\u2019s some seasonal benefit in the fourth quarter in life science with equipment sales, which were very strong. But I believe we\u2019ve made a lot of structural changes in the cost profile across life science. And I have to look at it specifically kind of going to the next couple of quarters, but this step up is real. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Eastman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just last question follow-up on dental, if we look at the dental, I think Tom you had suggested maybe first half of \u201918 would see flattish revenue. So perhaps a little bit of growth in the back half. But I\u2019m curious when you look at the margin expectation around dental for \u201918, do we have enough restructuring, do we have enough growth investment without a great deal of topline to drive 50 to 100 basis points of margin improvement in \u201918. What does the plan look like given the sales outlook for [dental]?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019ve balanced that pretty well over the last couple of years and we\u2019ll continue to do that in 2018. We\u2019ve applied restructuring dollars to drive enhanced productivity in a number of different areas, but at the same time we\u2019ve invested in R&amp;D and we\u2019ve invested in sales and marketing and I\u2019ve cited a number of those numbers as you may recall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I think it\u2019s a balance, and I think we shook that balance pretty well in \u201916 and \u201917 and I don\u2019t anticipate that we will approach any differently in 2018. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take our final question today from Doug Schenkel with Cowen &amp; Company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to start on Pall; you guys had a solid quarter even normalized for hurricane effect. Your comments earlier on order trends is encouraging. Specific to bio production is it safe to say that you\u2019ve seen an improvement in demands or at least normalization subsequent to some of the customer inventory rebalancing dynamics you mentioned earlier in 2017. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug it is safe to say that. It was a solid performance even normalized, the order trends are good and those order trends do point to an improvement in the demand profile, because I think you and others know, we saw a number of customers in that market adjust levels in a couple of cases slow down production during the course of 2017, and I think in the late third quarter and in to certainly the fourth quarter, we saw order trends improve. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe just to close out by going back to something we covered at length earlier in the discussion the topic of 2018 guidance rationale. You were clear in saying that based on what you saw in January you don\u2019t think there was any pull forward of revenue from Q1 in to Q4. And we know you have a history of tending to be prudently conservative with guidance especially earlier in the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that said, I just want to confirm two other things, one, that current FX rates would seemingly cut out as much as $0.10 to full year EPS relative to on the original guidance at least based on our math that those are not fully reflected in current guidance. And second, that you\u2019ve not fully adjusted guidance for the lower tax rate dynamic that you mentioned in response to an earlier question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug let me try to answer that. We have a \u2013 it\u2019s been in the 12, 13, 14 years we\u2019ve sort of avoided adjusted December guidance when we get to January. Just feels too early, too quick. I also recognized that January call next year will be Matt McGrew\u2019s first call. So I\u2019m not suddenly looking to sort of change things up here. But you\u2019re right there are some tailwinds out there, whether a Q4 demand, December demand, January numbers, they all point to good numbers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are benefitting from the further weakness of the dollar and we are a little more optimistic on the tax rate. Yes, probably a few offsets there, probably a higher share count, but that offsets are modest. So net-net we are feeling pretty good about where we are, and if those good things continue, we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to update you through the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Gugino</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Tracey and thanks everyone for joining us. We\u2019re around all day for questions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This does conclude todays\u2019 conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. </p>", "twitContent": "$DHR - Danaher's (DHR) CEO Tom Joyce on Q4 2017 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4141401-danahers-dhr-ceo-tom-joyce-on-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1213", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17828", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4141401-danahers-dhr-ceo-tom-joyce-on-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4141401-danahers-dhr-ceo-tom-joyce-on-q4-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
