Lisa?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lisa Su</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ruth and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our strong third quarter results highlight the progress we have made across AMD this past year as we improve our financial performance by delivering great products. Third quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 27% sequentially and 23% from the year ago period. Driven by upside demand for our graphics products and record semi custom sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to the significant revenue growth, we also achieved several financial and operational milestones in the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet and improved our P&amp;L through a series of capital markets transactions that reprofiled and reduced our debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also signed a strategic amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES that provide sourcing flexibility and financial predictability. Most importantly we delivered non-GAAP net income in the quarter, based on strong execution of our product road map and growing momentum across our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at our Computing and Graphics segment, we had solid growth in the quarter. Revenue increased 9% sequentially and 11% from the year ago period driven by improved sales of mobile APUs and discrete GPUs. Mobile processor revenue and unit shipments increased for the fourth straight quarter as seventh generation APU shipments continued ramping, highlighted by the launch of our new PRO series APUs earlier this month with HP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Customer and partner excitement for our Zen based desktop product Summit Ridge is growing as we successfully passed several key engineering and design win milestones in the quarter. We provided our first competitive performance preview of Summit Ridge in the quarter and believe we will have a very competitive offering for the $4 billion high performance desktop processor market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are working closely with our infrastructure partners and customers in preparation for the launch in early 2017. In graphics, we had a very strong quarter with discrete GPU revenue and unit shipments growing by double-digit percentages sequentially and year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The launch of our expanded family of Polaris desktop GPUs and our first full quarter of RX 480 sales drove our highest quarterly channel GPU revenue and ASP since early 2014. Radeon RX GPUs now account for more than 50% of our channel GPU revenue. Polaris GPU\u2019s continue to gain traction based on their leadership performance in VR and on the rapidly expanding number of software titles that feature the latest generation of API\u2019s like DirectX 12 and Vulkan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our progress in the quarter was punctuated by Oculus, announcing a limited edition Oculus-ready PC, powered by an AMD FX processor and Radeon RX 470 GPU. That brings the cost of entry for VR ready system down to $500 for the first time. This is a meaningful milestone for consumers and I am excited that AMD is enabling the ecosystem and driving broader adoption of the VR by making premium experiences available at such an attractive price point. We also delivered our fourth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth for our professional graphics products. In addition to solid workstation sales growth, we expanded our presence in the server GPU market, as HP announced availability of multiple Radeon options across their traditional and blade server offering. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just last week, we announced the collaboration with Alibaba cloud, China's largest cloud provider, to deploy Radeon PRO server GPUs across their data centers to expand the scale and services of their global cloud offering. We now have material server GPU engagements with multiple cloud datacenter providers, demonstrating that our strategy to grow our presence in this profitable market by delivering superior performance with Radeon PRO hardware in conjunction with industry standard programming tools and API\u2019s is beginning to pay-off. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to our enterprise embedded and semi custom segment. Revenue increased 41% sequentially and 31% from the year- ago period, driven by record semi custom sales, which included the ramp of three new FinFET-based products the Xbox One S updated PlayStation 4, and our new design win in the Sony PlayStation 4 Pro. We are on track to grow semi custom unit shipments and revenue for the third straight year, demonstrating our leadership in high performance gaming technologies for the very successful game console market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect fourth-quarter revenue to be down seasonally, as we transition from our annual semi custom sales peak in the third quarter. Our embedded product sales grew sequentially, as our newer design wins reach production. In server our Zen based high performance processor remains on track for introduction in the first half of 2017. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We successfully passed several silicon and platform technical milestones in the quarter, and have secured multiple new designs across OEM, enterprise and cloud providers. In closing as I complete my second year as CEO of AMD, I am pleased with the solid progress we have made across the Company on multiple operational, product, and financial fronts. We are executing our long-term strategy, and a set of near term priorities that I believe provide AMD with significant opportunities over the next 18 to 24 months, to drive top line revenue growth, operating margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have strengthened the core of the Company, by clearly defining the markets where we have technology and expertise to win; bringing a laser focus to our product execution around our graphics and microprocessor road map; creating deeper more lasting relationships with strategic customers, monetizing our assets and valuable IP with two joint ventures in China and re-engineering our balance sheet to increase our cash balance and reduce debt. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to thank the thousands of AMDers whose determination this past year has allowed us to put in place the financial and operational foundation to drive growth and profitability. In 2017, with Zen and Vega, we are focused on delivering our strongest product portfolio in over a decade, capable of unlocking multiple growth pillars for our business across the data center, gaming, and high performance graphics and PC markets. I am proud of what we have accomplished, and I believe that the best is yet to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder, to provide some additional color on our third-quarter financial performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Devinder Kumar</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Lisa, and a very good afternoon to everyone. In the third quarter, we achieved another milestone in our progress as we return to non-GAAP net income profitability. The third quarter financial performance was driven by strong demand for our semi custom SoCs, higher graphics revenue, and positive free cash flow. We executed a series of capital markets transactions that have significantly improved our balance sheet, and turned that profile, and will reduce interest expense beginning in Q4. We also finalized a long-term strategic Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Third-quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 27% sequentially, driven by higher sales of our record semi custom SoCs and higher graphics processor sales. The year-over-year revenue increased 23%, driven by higher sales of our semi custom SoCs, client mobile processors, and graphics processors. Non-GAAP gross margin was 31%, flat from the prior quarter, driven by a richer mix of PC and graphics products, offsetting lower margin semi custom product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-GAAP operating expenses were $353 million, up $11 million from the prior quarter, due to increased R&amp;D investment. We recognized $24 million of net licensing gains, associated with our server JV with THATIC. Non-GAAP operating income was $70 million this quarter, up $67 million from the prior quarter. Third quarter other net expense was $63 million, mostly consisting of a $61 million loss related to debt retirement. The equity loss in the ATMP JV was $5 million based on our 15% JV ownership stake.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-GAAP net income was $27 million, with earnings per share of $0.03. Non-GAAP EPS was calculated using 865 million diluted shares of common stock, which includes 12 million shares associated with the equity offering that closed late in the third quarter. Included in our GAAP operating loss and GAAP net loss is a $340 million charge associated with our Sixth Amendment to the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, compared to $36 million in the prior quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, turning to the business segments. Computing and Graphics revenue was $472 million, up 9% from the prior quarter, and up 11% year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales of GPUs and client mobile APUs. Computing and Graphics segment operating loss was $66 million, compared to $81 million the prior quarter, primarily due to higher revenue. Enterprise embedded and semi custom revenue was $835 million, up 41% from the prior quarter, and 31% higher year-over-year, driven by higher semi custom SoC sales. Operating income of this segment was $136 million, up from $84 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $301 million from the end of the prior quarter, including $274 million remaining from the proceeds of our capital market transaction. Excluding this amount, the cash was $984 million, as compared to $957 million last quarter. Free cash flow was a positive $20 million in the third quarter. Inventory was $772 million, up $29 million or 4% from the end of the prior quarter, in support of holiday season GPU and semi custom product sales expectations in the first part of the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total wafer purchases from GLOBALFOUNDRIES in third quarter were $168 million, and we continue to expect overall wafer purchases of approximately $650 million in 2016, including $155 million purchased in early 2016, as part of the Fifth Amendment to the WSA. Debt as of the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, down from the prior quarter, due to our significant debt reduction effort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the third quarter, we raised approximately $1.4 billion in cash, as a result of issuing $690 million of common stock, which includes the exercise of an underwriter\u2019s option to purchase 15% or $90 million of additional common stock, and the issuance of $700 million in two and one eight percent convertible notes due in 2026. We used the majority of these funds to redeem outstanding term debt through cash tender offers, and we paid off the outstanding ABL balance of $226 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, early in the fourth quarter, another $105 million of convertible notes were issued as part of the exercise of an underwriter\u2019s option, bringing the total principal amount of the 2026 convertible notes to $805 million. We also redeemed the remaining principal debt balance of $208 million of the 2020 senior note, which was our most expensive debt. This debt has now been fully paid off. The debt reductions and issuance of the new convertible notes due 2026 that occur in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter will result in approximately $55 million of annualized cash interest savings, beginning in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please refer to today\u2019s CFO written commentary for further details of the capital markets transactions and debt on the balance sheet. Free cash flow in the third quarter was a positive $20 million, compared to a negative $106 million in the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased revenue, improvements in working capital, and a reduction in capital expenditures. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to our fourth quarter 2016 outlook, a 14 fiscal week quarter, as it has an extra week. We expect revenue to decrease 18% sequentially, plus or minus 3%, primarily driven by a seasonal decline in our semi custom business, and an improvement in our CG business. Revenue at the midpoint of guidance would be up 12% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 32%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $350 million. IP monetization licensing gain to be approximately $25 million. To maintain non-GAAP operating profitability, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $32 million. Cash and cash equivalents to be up, in line with our guidance of ending 2016 with positive free cash flow, excluding cash from capital market transactions, and the net proceeds from the ATMP JV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventory to be down to approximately $660 million. Basic share count to be approximately 930 million, including 115 million shares related to the third quarter equity issuance. And we now expect full year revenue growth to be up approximately 6% from 2015, based on the midpoint of fourth quarter revenue guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, we are very pleased with the progress we made in the third quarter. With focused execution, we continue to build a solid financial foundation for the Company. In just the last three months alone, we achieved non-GAAP net income profitability, amended the WSA with GLOBALFOUNDRIES across multiple years, and deleveraged and derisked the balance sheet with our capital market transaction, such that over the next five years, there is less than $200 million of term debt due. We look forward to continued execution, and further improving our financial performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ruth. Ruth? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ruth Cotter</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we would be pleased to pull the audience for questions, please.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously a lot has gone on in the last quarter. I figured I would ask a couple things about Zen, since that\u2019s been one of the things that\u2019s most topical, in my conversations with investors. Lisa, you talked about in your prepared remarks, there are multiple OEM engagements and design wins for desktop, and also the same on server. Maybe you could do a little bit to expand upon those? I guess the timing of launch of each, and in particular in the server market, the focus, whether that be enterprise, or whether that be cloud-based. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for your question, and as you said, it\u2019s been a very busy quarter for us. As it relates to Zen, we are on track to launch in the first half of the year, for both our desktops and our servers. The desktop launch will go first, and it is on track for the first quarter, and then the server launch will go in the second quarter. We\u2019ve had a wide amount of sampling that\u2019s gone on in the third quarter. We have multiple customers on both the PC side, as well as the server side, who have working hardware now in their labs. They\u2019re bringing up their platforms and software, and we\u2019re very pleased with how smoothly it\u2019s coming up, actually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you asked specifically about the server side. Our focus on servers is really across the OEM business, including enterprise, as well as the cloud data centers. And I think the key for us is we\u2019re getting a lot of interest from our partners, and we continue to work with them to bring up their systems. But I think we are optimistic about where we are in the Zen bring-up, and the Zen launch cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess as a follow-up there, in the server market, I think obviously your GPU primary competitor has had some very stellar traction with server acceleration around GPUs, and you highlighted in the prepared remarks some wins and engagements that you\u2019ve had on Polaris, and I assume on Vega for server acceleration. Maybe you could expand upon that commentary a bit, what you\u2019re investing there, how the GPUOpen, or the OpenCL Environment is developing relative to the CUDA environment in server acceleration, and just what proportion of your GPU business could be driven by that server opportunity in the long-term? Any commentary that would be great. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So let\u2019s talk overall about our graphics business. So when you look at our graphics business, certainly we\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on the consumer side, with Polaris. But we\u2019ve also mentioned that we\u2019ve made good progress on the professional graphics side, including both workstations, as well as server GPUs. I think the market is certainly very receptive to growth in the server GPU area. I was just at the Alibaba Cloud computing conference last week, where we announced our collaboration with them. They\u2019re actually using parts that are pre-Polaris and pre-Vega.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we were demoing a GPU-based cloud server based on some of our FirePro technology, using hardware-based virtualization. And I think the main feedback that we\u2019ve gotten from them, as well as multiple other cloud engagements, is the hardware looks very good. We\u2019re working with them on the overall infrastructure and software to bring that up, and we believe that the products are very competitive in this market. And the market is nice because it\u2019s certainly margin accretive, to the consumer side of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we do expect as we bring out Vega in the first half of 2017 that will certainly strengthen the product portfolio. But there\u2019s a lot of interest in the cloud space around what we\u2019re doing with Radeon PRO and on the server GPU side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Matt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Perhaps your phone is on mute. Mr. Seymore, please unmute your phone. Mr. Seymore your line is online, please pick up your handset if your phone is on mute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We can go to the next caller, operator. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly, our next question is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my questions. I had two questions. First one, on the Alibaba deal, so this is not a new set of products you\u2019re developing, its products you already have. And can you talk about, to the extent this is like a cloud services offering versus deep learning applications, that they might be doing with your products? And I guess when I think about the architecture, I normally think about having an X86 processor sitting next to the GPU. I was wondering is it logical to assume that Zen is the natural X86 pairing with your GPUs in the Alibaba deployments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Mark. So again, I think on the Alibaba deployment, it is the beginning of what we expect to be a long-term collaboration. So the work today is being done on a pre-Polaris base, but we do expect that will upgrade as we go forward. I think the key is, there are many, many applications, but what we\u2019re starting from is a GPU base cloud server application, so in virtualized environments, you can imagine cloud gaming or remote workstation-type environments which need a lot of graphics horsepower, as well as virtual desktop environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think as we go forward, certainly, we view the opportunity to expand that into a broader set of workloads, as well as obviously on the CPU side as well. We think the cloud is a very important market for us to focus on, on both the GPU and the CPU side, and we\u2019re ramping up our efforts there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. A follow-up if I may. Last night Tesla announced that it was using NVIDIA for their self-driving car, but on the conference call Elon Musk, I think the expression he used, was that it was a tight decision between NVIDIA and AMD, which suggests that you\u2019re further along in solutions for deep learning and neural networking than most, including myself, thought. And so I was wondering, can you talk about your efforts in deep learning and artificial intelligence, how big is that business now? Do you have anything in that business now? And how do you grow that, going forward? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Mark. So look, there is a lot of interest in the deep learning space overall, and certainly our GPUs are very applicable to that space. So when we look at competitiveness and all that stuff, we think we can be very competitive there. We will be talking more about our strategy in the coming quarters, so maybe let me refer to that, Mark. But I think suffice it to say, I think we\u2019ve looked at GPUs as overall secular growth, whether you\u2019re talking about consumer, professional workstations, server GPUs, or any of this machine learning area. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest and lean in, in those areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask in the call. Lisa, Devinder, nice job on the quarter. I guess, Devinder first. Just going to the December quarter guidance, you\u2019re characterizing it as seasonal. I know the trappings of talking about normal seasonal, because there\u2019s so much variance around it, but it does seem like in prior quarters, where you had a 14th week, that extra week actually did help revenue a little bit. I\u2019m just kind of curious within the context of the December quarter guidance, how you\u2019re thinking about that extra week, both on the revenue line and on expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think if you look at a 14-week quarter, I think, John, you\u2019re right, it depends upon many factors. Our 14-week quarter is in the Q4 time frame, which is this quarter we are in. On the revenue side, I would say looking at it overall, there\u2019s not much of an impact, as the extra week falls during the holiday season, when a large portion of our operations and our customers are in shutdown mode. There is an impact on the expense side, but that\u2019s already contemplated within the guidance of OpEx that I gave, the $350 million due to the extra week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And then Lisa, a little bit longer-term. Over the last several quarters, you\u2019ve been somewhat forced to try to manage profitability levels to that breakeven line, given the lack of revenue growth. But now that you\u2019re on this path of more sustainable revenue growth, I\u2019m just curious as you think about R&amp;D specifically, how should we think about your desire to want to invest in higher rates, as revenue begins to grow from these levels? Because clearly, as Mark talked about on the last question, you\u2019ve got a lot of potential new areas and opportunities to go after. Can you give us a sense as to what \u2013 to what degree you think you\u2019ve been under-investing in R&amp;D and how we should think about R&amp;D investments over the next several quarters, as revenue growth kind of resumes?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, absolutely, John. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve been very prudent in how we\u2019ve invested overall. If you look at our operating expenses, 2016 to 2015, although we\u2019ve been relatively flat overall, we\u2019ve actually increased R&amp;D, relative to other elements of the P&amp;L. But as we see revenue growth and as we\u2019ve seen progress over the last couple of quarters, I think you\u2019ve also seen us increase our R&amp;D spend. I think there are several areas that we see as very large opportunities, and we talked about some of the graphics areas in the previous question with Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I also think in the data center, there\u2019s a large opportunity for us on the CPU side, as Zen fully comes to market. So I think we have an opportunity to invest a bit more in R&amp;D as our revenue grows, but we\u2019re still going to be very prudent with how we do that. I think the key metric there in terms of being net income profitable this quarter, ensuring that we get free cash flow positive from operations for the full year, those are all important metrics for us, and we\u2019re going to continue to manage very diligently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. Thank you guys. Congratulations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much. Do you expect GPU sales will grow sequentially in the December quarter, and what about computing revenues?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so David, I think we would expect overall that the CG business or the Computing and Graphics business will grow in Q4. The EESC business will be down. And then within the Computing and Graphics business, I would expect growth on both the graphics, as well as the computing side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And do you have any new semi custom wins you can tell us about, or at least give us some idea as to what the momentum is in the pipeline?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think on the semi custom side, David, I will say that we previously announced three, and that\u2019s the number that we\u2019ll talk about today. Two of them are now known, and they\u2019re both in the game console area, one is outside of game console. I will say that we have some very good active discussions on future products and applications, and we\u2019ll update more as we get further along.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, David.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Hemmelgarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much. And this is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. With Summit Ridge launching in Q1 of 2017, how would you expect the channel to ramp that? Do you see it ramping pretty fully in the first couple of quarters of the year, or are you looking for more normal PC seasonality?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I would expect that there will be a relatively good initial demand for Summit Ridge that may be not quite at the seasonal patterns. From where we see, Summit Ridge is playing in a space in the high-end desktop, that we currently aren\u2019t offering a product. So we believe we\u2019ll be competitive certainly with Core I5 as well as Core I7, and we will be launching in those areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Hemmelgarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much. I guess then looking at the GPU side of things, you guys saw some pretty nice share gains in the first half of this year with the legacy portfolio. Any metrics you can give to help frame how the business did in the first full quarter with Polaris? And any further color you can provide on how you see the share situation progressing into the year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re very happy with how Polaris ramped in Q3. The customer demand across all geographies was very strong. Q3 was primarily a channel-based quarter. With our Add-in-Board, and as some of you noted, in the early part of Q3, we actually had some supply constraints, given the customer demand. We did catch up towards the end of the quarter. So very pleased with how that\u2019s ramped. I think it\u2019s a very competitive market. We\u2019ve leaned into VR, and we\u2019ve leaned into our work with CX12 and I think you can see in some of the benchmarks that we\u2019re doing very well there. As we go into Q4, in addition to the channel partners continuing to ramp, you should expect some OEMs launching in Q4 more broadly. And so Polaris is off to a very strong start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Hemmelgarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much, Lisa, and congrats on the strong quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I first wanted to ask about the second sourcing ability embedded in the new Wafer Supply Agreement. So you\u2019ve said that you\u2019re going to be doing some second sourcing, starting in 2017. I wonder, did that push to actually seek out that supply diversification come from you, or was it from specific requests from your customers? And given that, how do you guys make the decision on which products to manufacture at GLOBALFOUNDRIES versus manufacture somewhere else?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Stacy. Let me start with that. I think, relative to our second sourcing or our supply sourcing flexibility, I think we make it on a product-by-product basis, based on where we are in the business. So we will have multiple products in 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer that will be sourced across foundries, and similarly when we talked about the Wafer Supply Agreement, we mentioned 7-nanometer as being a key target node for that. Relative to how we make the decisions, I think it\u2019s a combination of factors. It includes the complexity of the product. It includes the timing, customers, all kinds of things. So I think that\u2019s part of our product planning process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. But did the customers themselves have a hand in driving you to make that push to second source?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s one element, but frankly, I think what\u2019s more important to me is, I need to commit a strong, five-year product road map to the customers, and so we want to make sure that we have all the flexibility to ensure nothing happens. I\u2019ll give you just a little bit of context, Stacy, because I think you know our business well. In this past six months, we\u2019ve ramped five new FinFET products. I mean it\u2019s the fastest transition we have ever made in a process node, and it\u2019s gone really, really well. And I think what\u2019s helped us with that is the fact that we\u2019ve had two sources ramping at the same time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. For my follow-up, I just want to get some clarification on the timing of the Summit Ridge and Zen launches. You said Summit Ridge launches obviously in Q1 2017. You had said before that you were going to be shipping at least some product in Q4 of this year. Is that still true? And around the server launch in Q2, does that mean the volume is actually in Q3?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think our expectation is, we may ship some production samples in Q4, but the volume launch for desktop will be in Q1, and that\u2019s consistent with everything that we\u2019ve planned into the business. And as it relates to server, I think it\u2019s a little early to tell. I think we\u2019ll go through our process, and our customers\u2019 processes, and we\u2019ll have more color on that, as we get into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Stacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kunal Patel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, this is Kunal Patel for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned semi custom\u2019s decline and computing graphics to be up. Implies you\u2019ll have a pretty rich mix for Q4. Why is GM guided up only 1% given the really strong mix for 4Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at it from an overall standpoint, let\u2019s talk about Q2 to Q3, first of all. Q2 to Q3, we had a significant ramp in the semi custom space, which led to significant revenue in the EESC side, and we were able to manage the margin flat quarter-on-quarter which we are pleased with. Going to Q4, essentially with the Computing and Graphics business, that\u2019s what Lisa said ramping, and then EESC business, in particular semi custom coming down. The gross margin is up a percentage point, primarily due to the mix in revenue between the two segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kunal Patel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And for a follow-up, a question on the cash balance. Looked like you\u2019re guiding cash to be up in 4Q, and looks like you have some excess cash after the transactions you\u2019ve done in the quarter, and looks like you might be up over your $1 billion target balance. How do you plan on using the excess cash, or where would you reinvest that cash?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think right now, as you observe, it\u2019s through at the end of Q3 we did have some remaining net proceeds from the capital market transactions. After completing what we did in the early part of Q4, we have about $162 million of remaining net proceeds. What we plan to do with it, I think from a long-term strategy, that hasn\u2019t changed. Our plan is to continue to delever the balance sheet, reduce debt towards our longer-term targets of getting to the net debt cash neutral that I talked about previously, and getting the leverage ratio down to about 2 times from a longer term standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ruth Cotter</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly. Our next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you. Lisa, you talked about a $4 billion performance desktop opportunity. What\u2019s your thinking in terms of what you can eventually attain of that, just how are you thinking about your potential for market share? And can you give us some sense for, when you have a chip like this, you have enthusiasm about, how quickly it can ramp into that segment? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So I think if you look at our PC market share, as it\u2019s published by Mercury or so, we\u2019re talking about somewhere around 10%, plus or minus. I think we view that historically we\u2019ve been higher than that in the PC market, and certainly the desktop market, especially the desktop channel market. We\u2019re fairly well-known by that customer set. So we\u2019re enthusiastic about Summit. We think the performance is right on the mark with what we wanted to achieve. And we\u2019re hopeful that as we launch into the first quarter, that there will be a good, solid ramp in that business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great. And then, how are you thinking about as you think about bringing that chip to market, when will you make it available for third party benchmarks and sort of get a broader marketing program beyond the launch that you\u2019ve done? [indiscernible] before that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would expect certainly there are a lot of confidential benchmarks at the moment, but in terms of third party benchmarks, you would expect that in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Rolland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter, and nice to see it all coming together. We don\u2019t have September sell-through data yet. It\u2019s kind of hard to predict holiday season, what it\u2019s going to look like for consoles. Perhaps the past two quarters\u2019 growth in EESC might be outpacing expectations for consoles. So my question is, first of all, is that right? Is there something that\u2019s helping your guy\u2019s units here, like initial channel stocking for the PS4 Slim or the PS4 Pro? And how should we think about the size of the benefit that you\u2019re going to get from initial channel stocking there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Chris, I think the game console shouldn\u2019t be really looked at on a quarterly level, when you\u2019re looking at sell-in and sell-out. It\u2019s so different from the other markets. I would say on an annual basis, everything trues up. The thought process is, in Q2 and Q3, there is a bit of build ahead as the customers are really building for the holiday season. And the customers do so much of their business in the last six weeks of the year. That\u2019s when all of the inventory is drained. My view is that if you look on an annual basis, the game console business is doing quite well. So we expect units to be up. We expect revenue for the business to be up for us, and the quarterly transitions are less important. It\u2019s more, we want to ensure that we\u2019re meeting our customers\u2019 build cycles, so that they get to build everything that they want, and get it into their channels. But from my standpoint, I think it\u2019s a very well-managed system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Rolland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Congrats on a great quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Chris.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ruth Cotter</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, that concludes today\u2019s call.
