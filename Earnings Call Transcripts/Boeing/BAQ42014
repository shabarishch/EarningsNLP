Good day, everyone. And welcome to The Boeing Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. The management discussion and slide presentation plus the analysts and media question-and-answer sessions are being broadcast live over the Internet.</p> <p>At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I am turning the call over to Mr. Troy Lahr, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Boeing Company. Mr. Lahr, please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Troy Lahr</strong></p> <p>Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Boeing\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. I am Troy Lahr and with me today are Jim McNerney, Boeing\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Smith, Boeing\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.</p> <p>After comments by Jim and Greg, we will take your questions. In fairness to others on the call, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we have provided detailed financial information in today\u2019s press release and you can follow this broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Before we begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals included in our discussion this morning are likely to involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings, and in the forward-looking statement disclaimer at the end of this web presentation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we refer you to our earnings release and presentation for disclosures, and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim McNerney.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jim McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin today with a brief review of some recent strategic achievements, followed by comments on our strong 2014 operating performance, then an overview of the business environment. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and outlook in greater detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s move to slide two please. Boeing is entering 2015 stronger, healthier and better positioned in its markets than any time in recent memory. Our strategic accomplishments over the past 24 months alone provide a compelling picture of the progress we have made to enable sustain growth and improving profitability as we near the start of our second century in business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During that timeframe, we captured more than 2,700 net new Commercial Airplane orders, grew our market share and deliveries with six successful production rate increases, including reaching our target 10 per month on the 787 with more than three per month following steadily from our capacity expansion in South Carolina.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We completed a comprehensive refresh of our Commercial Airplane product line with the highly successful launches of the twin-aisle 787-10 and the 777X on a combined 400 orders and commitments, and the launch of the single-aisle 737 MAX 200 with a 100 airplane order from Lion Air.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Starting with the hard-fought technology gains of 787, we have built a substantial technological lead in commercial aviation, particularly in the high-value twin-aisle market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by listening to our customers and applying our proven technologies and lessons learned, in summary, we have derisk a decade of new product development, while expanding our edge in the performance and efficiency of our airplanes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Boeing defense, space and security, despite a top domestic budget environment, BDS continued to strengthen its relative market position and competitiveness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have accomplished this by driving significant new efficiencies in response to the environment in order to meet government customer needs and fund investments in technology and innovation, including in space programs, where we have restored our technological lead and market position in satellites, autonomous spacecraft, missile defense and human space flight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To the benefit of both businesses, we also secured unprecedented production continuity and improved economics with long-term labor agreements at our major production sites in Puget Sound, St. Louis and Philadelphia, and we retired significant and long-standing legal and financial risks from billions in potential liability on matters such as the A-12 program to the short-term threat to our balance sheet from Defined Benefit Pensions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know by the end of next year, approximately 90% of our workforce will participate in Defined Contribution Plan, which provide attractive and competitive benefits to employees without the risks to our balance sheet. Going forward, we remain ever focused on driving productivity and executing on our growth initiatives, which are fundamental to our success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To meet customer demand for our market leading Commercial Airplanes, we have five more rate increases ahead of us over the remainder of the decade. These higher production volumes will provide additional opportunities for driving step function gains in productivity for us and our suppliers through lean plus, capturing the value of quality and our partnering for success efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are equally committed to breaking the cost curve on our new development programs and delivering them on time with performance as advertised. To that end, we have focused our engineering teams on designs that are more producible, common systems and parts across airplane families and our disciplined gated development process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have also increased our investment in manufacturing and production innovations, including automation to increase quality and safety in the workplace and reduce load times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall for 2015 and throughout the remainder of the decade, these recent achievements in the marketplace, in our operations and in our financial performance set the stage for expected significant cash generation, the flexibility to invest for growth in support of our customers and the increasing return of cash to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that as perspective, let\u2019s discuss our 2014 results on slide three please. Strong fourth quarter results driven by higher commercial deliveries and solid operating performance capped an outstanding year. We continue to develop -- to deliver on our strategies to convert our backlog into profitable growth and to drive productivity and affordability throughout the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year we reported record revenue and core earnings per share, solid operating margins and strong cash flow, much of which was returned to shareholders. Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $60 billion for the year, on higher production rates and an industry record 723 delivers, which expanded our global market share leadership in deliveries for the third consecutive year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2014 was also an exceptional year for new bookings, as we captured commercial gross orders of 1,550 airplanes and record net orders of 1,432 airplanes, which increased our backlog to nearly 5,800 airplanes. When combined with strong orders from our Defense business, total company backlog grew to a record $502 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Other Commercial Airplanes key milestones in 2014 included successfully reaching the 42 per month production rate on the 737 and announcing plans to increase the 52 in 2018. Model certification and delivery of the first 10 787-9, completing preliminary design review on the 787-10 and breaking ground on the new 777X composite centers in Puget Sound and St. Louis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Boeing defense, space and security also had a very strong year, with solid revenue, healthy margins and significant new business wins and program milestones. Key contract awards captured during the fourth quarter, included an order for two 702 high-power satellites, multiple long-term international service contracts, including a 25-year order from the Australian Government to train rotary wing aircrews valued at approximately $500 million, and finalization of the NASA Commercial Crew Award announced in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Noteworthy program milestones in the quarter included the first flight of the 767-2C test aircraft for the KC-46 tanker program, the selection of the V-22 by Japan to fulfill their tilt-rotor aircraft requirements and U.S. Government funding for EA-18G Growler production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, our strong operational performance trend, significant cash flow and confidence in the future, all supported by our December announcement of the new share repurchase authorization totaling $12 billion and a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 4. Our view of the business environment remains positive, given favorable global air traffic trends, improving airline profitability and the continuing need for efficient and value-creating products we provide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Strong growth in the commercial airplane market continues to drive demand that supports our planned production rate increases over the remainder of the decade. Net new orders for 2014 that I mentioned earlier were essentially twice our 2014 output, and our record backlog of 5,800 airplanes represents approximately eight years of production at current rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Replacement demand remains an important market driver, with airlines continuing to introduce newer more efficient airplanes with superior economics and a rapid return on investment in place of older less efficient models and service. Notwithstanding, a fuel price environment today that is well below the 15-year average, the value proposition for our airplanes remains a compelling one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Historically, we have seen aircraft orders more correlated to airline profits. And as many of you may recall, we closed the business case for and launched the 787, when oil was at $40 a barrel. Furthermore, based on discussions with our customers, more oil prices have not substantially changed their views on fleet planning, for their commitment to existing delivery schedules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our new technologically advanced airplanes, not only have far better fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, but also often deliver higher passenger and cargo revenue, increased residual values, a better overall passenger experience and greater range, allowing for new city pairs and more optimal routes. All of these elements provide significant value to our customers over the life of the aircraft.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we see low fuel prices and positive traffic trends as beneficial to our industry and growth prospects. Our long-term outlook also remain strong, as we expect the combination of growth and replacement to drive the need for nearly 37,000 aircrafts over the next 20 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the twin-aisle segment, we continued to see healthy demand for both the 777 and the 777X, which are outselling the competition by a wide margin, giving us confidence in our ability to efficiently transition production between the two airplanes. In 2014, we captured 63 new orders for current 777 models, giving us 217 firm orders in backlog.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect demand for the 777 to remain healthy through the end of this decade, with an anticipated average order capture of around 40 to 60 airplanes per year to support the transition to the 777X. With the new airplanes -- with the new airplanes scheduled to enter final assembly in the 2018 timeframe, this transition will leverage new manufacturing processes and technologies being proven on the current 777 to optimize the 777X production system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 787 program, which delivered a twin-aisle industry record, 114 airplanes in 2014, we remain focused on continued production efficiencies and support our future planned rate increases to match the strong market demand for the airplane. Since the first customer flight, 787 fleet has now flown -- has now safely flown approximately 30 million passengers more than 400 million miles, while saving 1 billion pounds of fuel, providing game-changing efficiencies and capabilities to 29 customers worldwide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the single-aisle segment, demand for our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX, also remains high with cumulative orders totaling more than 2,660 airplanes from 57 customers. The Development of the MAX remains on track for the first delivery in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to defense, space and security, we continued to see solid support among U.S. customers and Congress for our major programs. In addition to the Growler funding I mentioned earlier, the FY \u201815 budget signed into law in December fully funds other core Boeing production programs, such as the Apache helicopter and the P-8A Poseidon. Key development programs like tanker and Long-Range Strike also were fully funded and additional funds were added for the Space Launch System.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see strong international demand for our offerings as well, particularly in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014, international customers for our defense, space and security represented 28% of revenue and 36% of our current backlog. While notable alone for its size, the strength of our international defense backlog also comes from its diversity across our product and services portfolio and the geographic mix of its customer base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our investments in technology and innovation for organic growth continue in areas, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and the critical few large-scale future programs that are priorities for our customers like Long-Range Strike, UCLASS and the T-X Trainer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The relative strength of our defense, space and security business stems from a portfolio that is reliable, proven and affordable, supported by our ongoing market-based affordability initiative, which is focused on reducing operating costs by another $2 billion to ensure competitiveness through the ongoing downturn in domestic defense spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, our business strategies are aligned to the realities and opportunities of our markets, and our teams are executing them well to deliver topline and bottom-line performance and capture new business to sustain our growth and profitability for the decades to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now over to Greg for our financial results and our updated guidance. Greg?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Jim and good morning. Let's turn to slide 5 to discuss our full year results. Revenue for the year was a record $91 billion, reflecting 5% growth from last year, driven by higher deliveries in our Commercial Airplane business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Core earnings per share totaled $8.60 for the year, representing a 22% increase. The increase in core EPS was driven by strong operational performance across the company. Adjusting for the tax items in the A-12 litigation settlement 2013, core earnings per share increased 14%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow for the year was also very strong at $8.9 billion. The robust cash generation was driven by higher deliveries, solid core operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures, and capturing the early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now move to our quarterly results on slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 3% to $24.5 billion, driven by strong Commercial Airplane deliveries. Core operating margins increased to 9.6%, reflecting solid productivity gains in both businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fourth quarter core earnings per share increased 23% to $2.31 on higher volume and continued strong operating performance. Fourth quarter 2013 included again $0.34 for the A-12 litigation settlement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now discuss Commercial Airplanes on slide 7. For the fourth quarter, our Commercial Airplane business increased revenue 15% to $16.8 billion on a record 195 airplane deliveries and solid operating margins of 9.3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The margin benefit from the higher volume mature program was offset by the impact of higher 787 deliveries and the anticipated increase in period costs, primarily for investments to support future growth and productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Commercial Airplanes revenue for the year was a record $16 billion, an increase of 13% as we successfully executed on our planned production rate increases, resulting again a record deliveries totaling 723 aircrafts. Commercial Airplanes captured $27 billion of net orders during the quarter and backlog grew to a new record of $440 billion and nearly 5800 aircraft.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specifically on the 787, we exceeded our delivery guidance for the full year as the team worked hard to deliver 114 787s and in total, we've now delivered 228 787s to 29 customers, 14 of which were new customers in 2014. We continue to see progress in key operational performance indicators as we further implement production efficiencies and stabilized the overall 787 production system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 787-8, we've seen a decline in unit cost of approximately 30% over the last 175 deliveries and on 787-9, we\u2019ve seen declines of 20% since the first delivery. Based on this progress, our production schedule and planned productivity investments, we continue to expect the 787 to be cash positive during 2015 and we still anticipate deferred production to decline shortly after we\u2019ve achieved the 12 per month production rate in 2016. No change to these fundamental milestones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, the 787 deferred production increased $960 million to $26.1 billion and we now anticipate 787 deferred production to grow at moderate levels for the next several quarters as productivity improvements on both models offset timing of supplier negotiations, further investments to optimize the production system and our decision to maintain higher employment levels to ensure the continued smooth introduction of the 787-9 and further incorporate additional productivity and reliability investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These focused decisions and efforts are expected to continue to drive long-term efficiencies, margin improvement and cash generation on the 787 program. Overall, our focus and priorities remain unchanged for the 787 program. Solid day-to-day execution, risk reduction and improving long-term productivity and cash flow going forward while continuing to have smooth ramp up on the 787-9 production, prepare for the 12 per month rate introducing the -10 while again driving efficiencies across all aspects of the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s turn now to Defense, Space and Security results on slide eight. Fourth quarter revenue for our defense business was $7.6 billion and operating margin increased to 12.1% due to strong business across the portfolio. Revenue for Boeing Military Aircraft declined to $3 billion in the fourth quarter resulting from lower planned C-17 and F-15 deliveries. Operating margins increased to 12.3% in the quarter, driven by solid operating performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Network and Space Systems revenue declined to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter on lower government satellite volume. Operating margin at N&amp;SS was 8.8% in the quarter. Global Services &amp; Support reported 2% increase in the fourth quarter revenue to $2.4 billion on higher MM&amp;U volume and generate strong operating margin of 14.9%, driven by higher operating performance. Defense, Space and Security reported a solid backlog of $62 billion with 36% of our current backlog now representing some customers outside the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now turn to slide nine. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $5 billion. The strength of our cash flow was driven by higher volume, strong operating performance, favorable timing of receipts and expenditures and again early benefits of our disciplined working capital initiatives. With regard to capital deployment, we paid $519 million in dividend to shareholders and repurchased 7.8 million shares for $1 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 2014 repurchase activity to 47 million shares for $6 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as Jim mentioned earlier, we announced in December that our Board of Directors increased the share repurchase optimization to $12 billion and increased the dividend 25%, up 88% in the last two years. We expect to complete the repurchase authorization over approximately the next two to three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our capital deployment to date continues to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and backlog and our commitment and confidence in the business performing well going forward. Returning cash to shareholders along with continued investment to support future growth remains priority for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now move to cash and debt balances on slide 10. We ended the quarter with $13.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and our cash position continues to provide solid liquidity and positions us well going forward. Again our financial strength allows us to continue to invest in key growth areas of the business, returning cash to shareholders and execute our cash deployment strategies going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to slide 11, we\u2019ll discuss our outlook for 2015. Our guidance for 2015 reflects solid core operating performance, higher deliveries at Commercial Airplanes business while reflecting the near-term investments needed to support our efforts to drive long-term growth and productivity. Core earnings per share guidance for 2015 is set to be between $8.20 and $8.40 per share and excluding the 2014 tax settlements totaling $0.71 per share. 2015 earnings per share is expected to grow between 4% and 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenue for 2015 is forecast to increase to be between $94.5 billion and $96.5 billion, representing growth of between 4% and 6%. Our 2015 Commercial Airplane revenue guidance is between $64.5 billion and $65.5 billion reflecting 8% to 9% growth as we execute on our record backlog.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The 2015 commercial delivery forecast is now between 750 and 755 airplanes and 787 deliveries for 2015 are expected to be essentially in line with the 10 per rate -- 10 per month production rate plus a few early build deliveries. Commercial Airplanes operating margin guidance is set to be between 9.5% and 10% on improved operating performance offset by greater dilution impact of higher planned research and development spending, higher 787 deliveries and further investments to support future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Defense, Space and Security revenue guidance for 2015 is between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion reflecting the continued challenging defense environment, particularly offset -- partially offset, excuse me -- by the ongoing international growth. Operating margin guidance of the defense business is now between 9.75% and 10% reflecting continued productivity efforts offset by the impact of lower volume and delivery mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Supporting our long-term growth plans, we expect research and development spending for 2015 to be approximately $3.5 billion, with about 70% related to 787, particularly driven by the planned increase in 777X and 787-10 development while at BDS, we continue to invest in key strategic growth opportunities going forward. We expect operating cash flow for 2015 to be greater than $9 billion, reflecting higher deliveries, strong operating performance, continued 787 productivity and capturing the final C-17 orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is somewhat offset by higher cash tax payments and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures benefited 2014 results. As we look forward, we expect further growth in operating cash flow in 2016 as we continue to execute on our backlog, capture additional productivity gains and improve 787 cash performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Capital spend guidance for 2015 is approximately $2.8 billion driven by the new 777X facilities and equipment, Charleston expansion to support the 787 rate increase, and other investments to support continued growth and productivity. Our required pension contributions in 2015 will be minimal as a result of legislative pension changes. We are now foregoing discretionary pension funding in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look into the next quarter we expect first quarter revenue, core EPS, and cash flow could be the lowest during the year based on timing of deliveries, phasing the expenditures and advances. First quarter EPS is estimated to be approximately 20% of our full earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in summary, Boeing\u2019s 2014 financial performance and the 2015 financial guidance reflects the strong demand for our products and services, the strength of our backlog, and our continued focus on driving productivity throughout the entire enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will now turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jim McNerney</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Greg. 2014 was another year of strong operating performance and significant cash generation, as we successfully executed on our record backlog that allowed us to return cash to our shareholders, while still prudently investing to sustain our growth and competitive advantage. Built upon an underlying foundation, 2014 was a very strong year for Boeing as we continue to deliver on the significant and sustained growth and increasing profitability and cash flow that our strategies were designed to produce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees, our partners, and customers around the world. We achieved critical strategic milestones in both businesses.

Did that change result and any negative margin impact on the program and how far rightward did it shift the cash breakeven point you had talked about in the past?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just from a high level, does it change -- does the differencing in the profile, a deferred production here represent a change in how you\u2019re managing the program or thinking about the long-term risk profile or return profile on the program? Is it reactive in anyway? Just from a high level, is there something more we should read into that and how you\u2019re approaching risk and return now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes -- no, I think that there you shouldn\u2019t look at any differently, Carter. I think when you step back and you look at how this program has performed, it\u2019s performed very well, 114 deliveries last year, and obviously we\u2019ve reached the record production rate higher than any wide-body in aviation history and we are planning to go up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The fundamental milestones that you talked about with regard to cash positive, we still expect that in '15 and we still expect deferred to decline shortly after we hit that 12 a month that we are planning for in '16. So those things have not changed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We obviously -- as I discussed, we see next two to three quarters similar growth than what we\u2019ve seen and then later in '15 the decline at a healthier rate. But all of that is anticipated in the guidance we gave in cash flow. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s what matters. You\u2019ve seen our results in '14, you see our guidance for '15, our cash, all that is again taking into consideration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the program margin?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Program margin was just down slightly in the quarter but not significant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Carter Copeland</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next, we will take Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Harned</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am interested, you\u2019ve got -- I mean, you\u2019ve had very strong cash in Q4, so we are looking at more than $9 billion in operating cash in '15. And then, I was surprised to see deferred continuing to rise. Could you walk through, really two things here, the puts and takes of getting of your cash -- operating cash flow in '14 to '15?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, when you look at how much you\u2019ve got in the balance sheet, you\u2019ve got now cash in STI of over $13 billion and you\u2019re going to generate more than $6 billion in free cash flow. How do you expect to deploy that? You should have declining risk here. This is a lot of cash. And it seems like it\u2019s a lot more than you would really need to manage the company on the balance sheet today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, as you know, Doug, one of the strategies we had in place was to derisk the decade and we\u2019ve certainly done. The risk profile going forward is a very different than it was in the past. And so continuing to execute on delivering on the backlog, focusing on the core operating performance, again improving the 787 cash profile, and of course capturing those final C-17, that\u2019s the biggest driver from '14 to '15. We are going to have higher cash taxes because we are improving unit costs on 787. And we have again slightly higher R&amp;D, all planned out, 777X and 10X. So those are kind of the moving pieces from '14 to '15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regards to deployment, you\u2019ve seen what we did last year. You see the authorization we have in place, it\u2019s in place to utilize it and we plan to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Howard Rubel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Howard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Howard Rubel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Nice numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Howard Rubel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One question related to 787 and sort of orders related. As I look at it, this year is more of a year to fill in some holes and demonstrate that the products you have, have extended legs. Could you address some of the opportunities with some specificity on 777? And then also on what you\u2019re finding from customer feedback on the 787? And what kind of movement there is to Dash 9s?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me take a swing at that one Howard. On the 777, the good issue there obviously is the bridge, transition to the bridge because I think the market is focused on the launch of the 777X, a very robust launch. As to the bridge, there is 63 orders this year that Ray and his team secured bodes well for the 40 to 60 we need over the next few years to get to the bridge. So I am feeling increasingly comfortable there. Long-term demand for the airplane, there is no competition for the airplane. So I feel very good about the long-term demand for the airplane.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think on the 787, I think what you\u2019re going to see is a mix from Dash 8s to Dash 9s to Dash 10s and that we saw moving around this skyline as that\u2019s accommodated. That\u2019s all good news for The Boeing Company in the sense that we\u2019re usually selling more capability for higher price and that dynamic, I don\u2019t see changing. I think we are still -- we are little bit hampered by the number of orders we have, I mean, that\u2019s without the 20, 21ish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would anticipate toward the end of this year and in the next year a rekindling of orders on the 87 as we get a little closer to the end of the decade. People begin to pick up options. The moving around of the Skyline was subsided a little bit. And the airplanes performance, quite frankly, I cited it in my remarks, the airplanes performance to be candid is better I think, by and large, than we sold it at.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we are very pleased with the operating costs, the fuel savings obviously, and the thing that is often left unnoticed here is that this grows the market. This airplane enables wide-body or any kind of body, quite frankly, city pairs that have never been enabled before. And so I\u2019m sort of making up the number, but it's 20% of the demand for this thing is opening up capacity between city pairs that was not available before because of the performance of the airplane. So it\u2019s a little bit longer answer than you wanted, but that\u2019s my dump on the subject.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Howard Rubel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll go to Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Nadol</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Joe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Nadol</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, I had a couple for you on just deferred. So wondering if you could as you\u2019ve done the last couple quarters quantify, if there is any pull-forward from building Dash 9 inventory, if you could give us a sense sequentially if Dash 8 and Dash 9 unit costs declined, and if this was just mix related that you didn't see any deferred reduction sequentially?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, there was no pull-forward in the quarter, Joe. There was more Dash 9. It was about 30% more Dash 9 mix in third quarter versus fourth quarter. So that obviously had an impact. And then we had more reliability enhancements in the fourth quarter than we did in the third. And again that\u2019s something that we are really trying to be proactive and get those embedded into the production system, so they are there when we deliver the airplane. But those are really the big moving pieces between 3Q and 4Q.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Nadol</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the unit costs on both models did decline sequentially or they were flat?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They did come down in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Nadol</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just one final clarification, when you say you expect the program to be cash flow positive in 2015, that\u2019s deferred building, but you deliver a few of the early production aircraft and you\u2019re also including advances in advance of that production rate increase to help to get you to cash flow positive. Is that right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, that\u2019s right, Joe. No change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Nadol</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You are welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll go to Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai Von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks so much. So you are talking about the deferred going up another, it sounds like $2.5 billion over the next three quarters, that's a pretty big change. Could you give us a little bit more granularity in terms of how much of that is inventory pull-forward, how much of that is buffer stock and how much of that is other items?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I guess, Cai, I\u2019d put it into three categories. First of all, let me just back up. The things we are doing on this program every day are all about driving cash and profitability over the long-term. So there is going to be decision we make quarter-over-quarter or frankly between last year and this year and forward, that are enhancements to the production system over the long-term that are proven, we've done them on other programs, and now it's about implementing them on the 787. So there\u2019s some of that in there that\u2019s really again focused on investments over the long-term of the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On as far as labor, we are coming down on unit cost, but we are coming down in a lower rate than what we expected or anticipated. And again, we are doing that at these higher labor levels to really achieve the stability, incorporate those reliability enhancements I talked about. And then these productivity initiatives, again they are going to take folks to work through each one of those at every sequence of the bill and we are working that. And we are working at an enterprise level. We are leveraging across Boeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we know where the bottlenecks are or some of the challenges are. So now it's about reaching -- when we reach the 10 a month, capturing that and improving upon that. On the supply chain side, we\u2019ve talked about the timing of some of our discussions and negotiations and some of those have moved out to the right and I think I\u2019ve mentioned before that we're seeing a benefit in doing that. These guys are still coming down the learning curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are helping them in encapsulate productivity enhancements that we are seeing or able to achieve in Charleston and Everett, we want to get that back into the supply chain. And then from there, we\u2019ll mature our negotiations. So again a near-term sacrifice, but much long-term benefit frankly for us and our supplier. But those are really the three main categories that we are faced with over the next kind of year and to the end of '15. But very focused again on the long-term and very focused on improving cash in the program and none of those fundamental have changed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai Von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you quantify any of those three items?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I can\u2019t Cai. I mean, those are the main three categories, like those are ones we are working on. There is no I see significant split between the three of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Cai Von Rumohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You are welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next we\u2019ll go to Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sam Pearlstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Sam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sam Pearlstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to see if you could help me out on two things. One is on the C-17, can you talk about how many are on the balance sheet at the end of the year of 2014 and how many you are assuming will be there at the end of 2015?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just looking at the share count assumption you have embedded in your guidance? That would seem to imply a pretty sizable buyback in order to get 40 million shares down on average over the course of the year? Can you try and size at all you are thinking around that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, on C-17, we\u2019ve got seven that remain unsold, Sam. We delivered seven last year. We\u2019ll deliver four in 2015 and then four in \u201916 and then probably about two in \u201917. So we are in active discussions with customers for the balance of those aircraft remaining and we are highly confident that we\u2019ll sell those and be able deliver them over that timeframe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the share count, like I said earlier, you saw what we did in \u201914, we up the reauthorization. So we are very focused on that, and we\u2019ll continue to execute and utilize that authorization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sam Pearlstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Greg, if I kind of look at the last three years, you\u2019ve been running, if you correct for the 787 after-tax, 14 bucks a share, pretty consistently over that period of time or about $10 billion? As you level off on the 787, any reason we shouldn't think about that as a starting point of discussion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'm sorry, Myles, I wasn\u2019t tracking exactly what you are focused on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s over the last three years you correct for all the 787 inventory build\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ve been doing a consistent level of $10 billion or about $14 a share in free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Any reason that shouldn\u2019t be the starting point of a discussion once you do level out on this 787 inventory?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. I think that\u2019s fair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s fair. I mean, obviously, you've seen it, it\u2019s a significant focus area for us and any -- all elements around working capital and we are going to continue that effort going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just one clarification, were there any adjustments on the accounting blocks in the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. 737, an increase of 200 of -- all of which were MAX airplanes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Myles Walton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Gursky</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Gursky</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the trajectory of CapEx and R&amp;D as we move out into \u201916, \u201917, maybe even into\u201918, just kind of relative to where we are going to be in \u201915, we are going up, down, sideways on those items?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All I mean, CapEx, this year, obviously, is just tied to the growth, right, it\u2019s on the successful launch of this 777X, the -10 and then, of course, 787 rate combined with 737. So those are the real of a -- fundamental drivers of the growth in CapEx. This year will be increased because of preparing for the entry into service of those aircraft and we will probably have a similar year next year and then it will start to decline from there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, all tied to growth, all tied to the successful launches of those programs, combined with productivity, we\u2019ve got additional productivity initiatives in here, including the automation that, Jim, talked about and so, that\u2019s kind of the profile on CapEx.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For R&amp;D, again, 777X and 10X as 787-9 certainly winds down and 37, I\u2019ll say, MAX continues at a similar spend rate. If you look at the entry into service on 777X, you\u2019re going to see a profile from here, but again you\u2019re going to see 10X declining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re continuing to manage it and look at further ways to optimize the R&amp;D spend, as Jim has talked about a lot. But for this year, we\u2019re seeing that about $3.5 billion and I think managing it very efficiently and taking advantage of a lot of things, again that Jim highlighted, in doing it in a more efficient and effective manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Gursky</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just one quick follow-up on the 777, can you talk a little bit about what the impact is going to be on your ability to deliver aircraft late in the decade, as you said, they\u2019re in the 777X, will that be coming in at the slower flow time and will your ability to deliver come under some pressure as throughout late in the second\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I don't think our ability to delivery will come under pressure, but you'll have a very similar to what you\u2019ve seen on the 787. You\u2019ll have some additional flow time associated with those early introductory units and that will get feathered into the current 777 as we deliver those. So, yeah, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s well planned out phasing in strategy that was really leveraged off the success of the 787 and that\u2019s the plan going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Gursky</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next we\u2019ll go to Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Yes. Good morning, Jim and Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Jim, I appraise you on the work here, let me give you one. Jim, this book-to-bill ever go down again, it\u2019s another strong year? How are you thinking about \u201915 and your comment on the 777 bridge, you\u2019re getting increasingly comfortable there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The 63 new, is it was characterize that as just replacement of the -200 or could you give a little more color there? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. I mean, I think the -- I mean, two examples with the ANA and Cutter where there was a blended order of both, the new airplane, the X, as well as one of the current models. I think in both cases the 300ERs and I\u2019d maybe for getting exactly the model type in one of those cases. But I think it is a sign that the capability is an enduring capability and the competition is -- I hate to say it this way but there is not much competition to this capability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So versus any alternative, both the old and the new make sense and it\u2019s more a matter of satisfying demand and running a competitive airline that drives them to buy both types. And so we\u2019re in a fortunate position here. And it's one that we will shamelessly take advantage of.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on book-to-bill for \u201815.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Book-to-bill, its early in the year, I think, it will at least be one to one would be is the way it looks now and we\u2019ll see as the year goes forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Arment</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Good morning, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ve obviously done a fantastic job getting airplanes out the door. Just wanted a follow-up on profitability however, one would think unless I\u2019m thinking about it wrong that given the volume of airplanes that the company has delivered that profitability in the quarter would've been better at Boeing Commercial, Defense seemed to do wonderful. And then as we go into next year, without the volume of airplanes going out the door and given the overhead absorption that again, margins would be higher than what you guys are projecting them to be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I mean, in the quarter Ron, 37 and 777 unchanged from quarter-over-quarter, so no change in margins there. And as I mentioned, we did have a block extension on the 37. This is really associated with period costs. As you know, we\u2019re seasonably high in fourth quarter around taxes and fleet support and just the amount of deliveries we have. And then some investments we've made across the business whether it takes several reliability or in some of the fleet management efforts. So I\u2019d say, high in the quarter but not something that it would take forward from here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Okay. And then one follow-on, if I may, in the defense business, we haven\u2019t talked heck a lot about that. Whether any contract close out one time types of things in the quarter that boosted margins there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nothing significant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ron Epstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Troy Lahr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for one more question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that will be from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, just on the improvement cost on 87, I think you said that you took cost down about 30% over the last 170 odd airplanes something like that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. 175.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So now I'm guessing with the unit deferred as it stands a little over $30 million. And I know there is some puts and takes and some things in that number that probably on aircraft specific. But I\u2019m guessing airplanes are costing these days somewhere around $130 million. To get down to a breakeven level, I would imagine you need about another 20% cost reduction from here, give or take back to the envelope, can that be done inside of a year with the volume of airplanes we\u2019re talking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we continue to have plans to reduce the unit cost on the program run whether it's through our only internal efforts or working with the supply chain. So those initiatives are all laid out and now we got to go execute those and we have plans in place to do them. Again, this is stuff we know how to do. We've done it on other programs and we\u2019re putting obviously, additional focus on that and this again remains a priority for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So at the same time, we\u2019re continuing to invest in productivity as I talked about. As we get more mature with the production system, we see more opportunities to do things better and more efficiently but they taken in investment. So short-term investment -- short-term challenge but long-term significant gains for the program. And that\u2019s really where we got everybody focused.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just a clarification from earlier, your guidance embeds the buyback that you\u2019ve talked about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It embeds some point of buyback. Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Spingarn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen, that completes the analyst question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now return you to The Boeing Company for introductory remarks by Mr. Tom Downey, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications. Mr. Downey, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Downey</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We will continue with the questions for Jim and Greg. If you have any questions following this part of the session, please call our media relations team at 312-544-2002. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question and in the interest of time, we ask that you limit everyone to just one question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And first go to Jon Ostrower with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon Ostrower</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Jon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Jon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jon Ostrower</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a bit of clarity on the math that you guys presented on the 77 deferred production. Obviously, you\u2019re passing $26 billion on deferred cost with 1,100 airplanes to go in your accounting block. So you're booking a positive margin on 787. Just really flat out mean to zero those deferred costs, just really simple back on the envelope, you need to be generating $25 million in profit per plane starting today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And obviously, there\u2019s a curve in there and you guys haven't hit the unit breakeven yet, so the $25 million figures, even higher than that. So I mean, at what point of the assumption that you\u2019re putting to your accounting efforts that are generating your record earnings. Ultimately, do they reflect the reality of the 787 programs cost reductions ultimately keeping the program stable?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Jon. I guess, I\u2019d start with, as I said the fundamental milestone around the 787 being the cash positive than the deferred planning after we reach 12 a month, 2016 haven\u2019t changed. And the focus on the program hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s all around, again, being more efficient on each unit in capturing additional unit cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are initiatives within the supply chain. Obviously, there is initiative within our factory and we\u2019re working to capture those, and continue the journey on the successful productivity we have in the program today. That\u2019s what everybody is focused on, ultimately leading to again cash positive in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next questions from Julie Johnsson with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julie Johnsson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, hi all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julie Johnsson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Congrats on a great quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julie Johnsson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just wanted to follow up on something that we saw late in 2014, Zodiac had some issues with C deliveries and certification and I know it affected some 787 deliveries. And they had cautioned that it's taking longer than they had anticipated to straighten some of those issues out. Just wondering, if you see any trickle over into Q1 and if this is potential, a warning sign or red flag as you prepare to ramp up 737 and 787 production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think there is no question that seat supply did impact some deliveries and some fall in our production system. We are working through it now. We see it being resolved this year. We regret any impact it has had on our customers but it\u2019s all been within our plans and within our guidance as we work through it. I think the supply base is adjusting to these higher volumes, both 787 and anticipated higher volumes and another programs and I think they'll be ready.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And next we\u2019ll go to Doug Cameron with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Cameron</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Cameron</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The quarterly defense question, Jim, you got some -- you got funding for some old Growlers in the 2015 budget. What are your thoughts of the timing for the future of this impious line and does it depend at all on what happens with the Long Range Strike contest, which is upcoming?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I mean, I think the statuses where true costs to the end of the decade on F-15s which is a big pieces of St. Louis. We\u2019ve regained momentum on F-18s. I think in the minds of many, there remains a need beyond that order. So there is a good chance that that line could continue at least to the end of the decade. Although, we do not yet have firm orders that's an assessment. And there is no question that when we win Long-Range Strike and I'm sounding as confident as I can, because I do believe we will, that it will solidify the future of St. Louis for many, many years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question from Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dominic Gates</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hello, gentleman. Question for Greg. You mentioned delivering some early 787s this year, early build 787s. There is something like 11 airplanes. Mostly the Terrible Teens as they are called that have been sitting there for four years and more. And about a year ago, a couple of customers seemed that those were earmarked for a pulled out Transaero was one of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So two questions about -- two parts to a question about that. First of all, is there any chance those have to be written off or sold so cheaply that it's almost the same thing and we get some accounting charges for those plans? And then secondly, it looks like you want to deliver maybe three this year, maybe three next year, very slow output. Is that a deliberate strategy because of the hefty unit costs, every time one of them enters the delivery stream?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not at all. The timing of the deliveries is really solely tied to when we finish the work on the aircraft. And frankly it's a matter of prioritizing the teams that have taken them off the production line and moving them over on the early build. So that is the only thing tied into that. It\u2019s really just about finishing up the aircraft for the customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regards the aircraft themselves, we continued to see a viable market and we are in active discussions with many customers related to those airplanes. So that is fundamentally how we're handling the EMC airplanes and you are right. I mean, we are work through them in a prudent fashion and we do expect to deliver three or four this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for one last question from the media.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that will be from Christopher Drew with the New York Times. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Drew</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Good morning. Jim, you mentioned space and I was just wondering if you could talk us a minute about what it's like to compete with SpaceX with their lower cost and aggressive lobbying and political clout in Washington? In various ways that you, Boeing and the United Launch Alliance compete with them and what you see happening in the long run in some of these areas?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jim McNerney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have respect for SpaceX. I think they offer more limited mission types than we do at this stage. But their combination of focus on gaining capability at improved cost is going to benefit the market. It will make us a better competitor in some segments where cost has become more important. I suspect that we will retain the lead in those segments where often manned type missions that go a long way into many places we\u2019ve never been before. I see the advantage, we have there will sustain itself for a long period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes our earnings call.
