Welcome to CVS Health Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, February 10, 2015.</p> <p>I would now turn this conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior VP of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>Nancy Christal </strong></p> <p>Thanks, Gillian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, President and CEO, who will provide a business update and Dave Denton, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review our fourth quarter results as well as guidance for the first quarter and year. Jon Roberts, President of PBM and Helena Foulkes, President of the Retail Business are also with us today and they'll participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks. During the Q&amp;A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up, so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our Web site. The slide summarizes the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. Additionally, note that our Form 10-K will be filed later this afternoon and it will be available on our<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> Web site at that time. Please note that during today\u2019s presentation, we will make forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons as described in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section and cautionary statement disclosures in those filings. During this call, we\u2019ll also use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our Company\u2019s performance, including free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one-year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now, I\u2019ll turn this over to our CEO, Larry Merlo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Nancy. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. This call wraps up 2014 and it was a great year for our company by any measure. We delivered approximately 10% growth in consolidated revenues, 14% growth in PBM operating profit, 8% growth in retail operating profit and 13.5% growth in adjusted earnings per share on a comparable basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a quarterly basis, we have consistently posted solid financial results and the fourth quarter was no exception. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8.4% to a $1.21 per share at the high-end of our guidance range and both the PBM and Retail segments exceeded our revenue expectations. Operating profit in the retail business grew 6.5%, just above the high-end of our expectations, while operating profit in the PBM increased about 1%, right in line with expectation. Additionally, we generated $2.9 billion of free cash in the quarter and $6.5 billion for the full year exceeding our expectations. Also today we are reconfirming the 2015 earnings guidance we provided back in December and Dave will provide the details behind our fourth quarter results and 2015 guidance during his review.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me turn to the business update. And I\u2019ll start with the 2015 PBM selling season. Gross client wins for \u201915 currently stand at $7 billion with net new business at $3.6 billion, both up approximately $400 million from our update back in December. And this excludes any impact from our SilverScript PDP, which I\u2019ll address shortly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now like the past several years our success in the \u201915 selling season reflects our high levels of service and execution, competitive pricing along with our unique integrated model, and our model allows us to provide differentiated products and services that generate savings for our clients while providing better health outcomes and convenience for their members.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now the $7 billion in new business encompassing about 150 new clients serving millions of new members, 2015 was the largest and most complex welcome season in our history. And as we stated previously we invested to ensure a successful welcome season and that took months of rigorous planning. The investments we made were well worth it and I want to take a minute to express how pleased we are with the extraordinary and successful welcome season we\u2019ve had. The feedback we've received from clients and consultants has been extremely positive and I'm very proud of the collective efforts of our colleagues. Now we expect our track record of success in winning and retaining business to continue in the 2016 selling season which is now underway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now many of you have asked what our clients are focused on, and the number one priority centers on controlling their rapidly rising specialty costs. And we\u2019re bringing them an array of differentiated solutions. Our Specialty Connect offering, which was rolled out by May of \u201914 is gaining client interest and traction in the marketplace. The program provides choice to receive a member specialty script at CVS retail or mail while preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. And physicians appreciate the ease of getting their patients started on therapy. No other PBM can offer this today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Clients are also interested in ways to manage specialty cost that fall under the medical benefit and our NovoLogix solution continues to resonate in the market. Overall, our specialty capabilities enable us to provide strong clinical support to patients while managing trend for our clients and this strategy is producing results. In fact specialty revenues were up a very healthy 56% versus the same quarter last year. That was driven by new business, the high class Hep C drugs and the addition of the Coram infusion business. Combined, our innovative offerings enable us to optimize cost, quality and access and should continue to drive share gains in this fast growing specialty sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now as you know another way we manage trend for clients is through our highly proactive approach to formulary management. We led the market with our formulary strategy for the 2012 plan year and since then we\u2019ve updated our template formulary on an annual basis and increasing specialty drugs are part of that strategy. Our formulary process enables our clients to provide excellent access to care while meeting their member\u2019s needs in the most clinical and cost effective manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now in January, Gilead\u2019s Hep C drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi became exclusive on the CVS/Caremark, Standard Commercial, Exchange, Medicare Part D and Medicaid Formularies. Harvoni is the preferred agent for genotype 1, Sovaldi is the preferred agent for the treatment of other genotypes. And our goal was to create the lowest net cost solution for the entire population of patients with all Hep C genotypes. We recognized the cost challenges and we remain committed to providing solutions for clients that choose to treat all their patients as well as those who feel it makes more sense to prioritize patients with the more advanced stages of lever fibrosis. We believe that our strategy meets patient needs while delivering excellent value and clinical options for clients and their members. At the same time, our formulary strategy positions us well in the 2016 selling season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now before turning to retail, let me touch briefly on our SilverScript product. We ended 2014 with about 2.9 million individual PDP wise. That was right on plan, and very consistent with what we forecasted and communicated at our Analyst Day, we now have about 3.4 million individual PDP members reflecting a successful annual enrolment period and we continue to be pleased with our progress in this growing area of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to retail, which produced solid results across the business, even with the tobacco headwind. Now we\u2019ve been tobacco free since September and here is what we\u2019ve learned over the past four months. The negative impact to our front store sales has been slightly less than anticipated. We know that the most heavily impacted categories are consistent with our expectations but the magnitude of that impact on those categories has been a bit less than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beyond the categories we expected to see impacted, other front store categories have not been negatively affected. And based on external data, it appears that our former tobacco sales have migrated largely to convenience stores and gas stations. There has been no dissuadable impact on our pharmacy business and since we launched our new CVS Health brand, customer awareness and response to the new branding campaign has been very positive and we\u2019ve seen a notable increase in customer perception of CVS as a leader.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let's review the fourth quarter retail results. Pharmacy same-store prescription unit volumes increased 5.3% on a 30 day equivalent basis and we continue to gain pharmacy share. Our retail pharmacy market-share was 21.1% in Q4 and that\u2019s up about 55 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago. Pharmacy same-store sales increased 5.5% versus the same quarter last year. The incidents of flu did pick up a bit in the quarter adding about 40 basis points to pharmacy costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pharmacy same-store sales also includes the negative impacts of about a 150 basis points due to recent generic introductions and another 190 basis points from the implementation of Specialty Connect. And you'll recall Specialty Connect transfers specialty scripts from our Retail segment into our PBM segment. Pharmacy margins increased again this quarter and were in line with our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now as we discussed previously CVS has contracted with 20 regional and national Part D plans for 2015, where CVS is positioned as a preferred provider and we\u2019ve taken a disciplined approach to our participation in these networks ensuring that margin compression and share analysis provide the right economics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the front store, we saw continued decrease in traffic. That was partially offset by an increase in the average customer basket. Our front store comps were down 7.2% and adjusting for the tobacco impact, front store comps would have been up 0.7%. The impact of the tobacco exit was about 800 basis points and that\u2019s about 100 basis points less than we anticipated. So again four months into it, it's still early but we\u2019re very pleased with these results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Front store margins benefitted in the quarter from the tobacco exit. On a comparable basis to last year, including adjusting for the tobacco elimination, front store margins improved modestly. And this underlying improvement in front store margin reflects our discipline in making responsible investments in promotion along with the continued growth of store brand sales. In fact we made great progress in store brand penetration in the quarter with store brands increasing to 22% in front store sales and that\u2019s up about 310 basis points from Q4 last year and about 190 basis points of that improvement reflects the removal of tobacco from our mix. The other 120 basis point reflects underlying progress in our store brand penetration. And we saw gains across health, beauty, general merchandise and edibles, and we see great opportunities to continue to garner store brand share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our store growth for the quarter, we opened 50 new stores, relocated 30, closed seven, resulting in 43 net new stores in the quarter, and for the full year we opened a 151 new stores, acquired 33, relocated 60, closed 22, resulting in 162 net new stores, and we continue to enter some new markets including Little Rock, Arkansas, and Seattle, Washington. So overall, our 2014 store growth equated to an increase in retail square footage of 2.4% and that was right in line with our plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As for minuteclinic, we opened 35 net new clinics in the quarter, 171 for the year, ending the year with 971 clinics in 31 states plus the district of Colombia. And continuing on its very strong growth trajectory, minuteclinic\u2019s revenues and customer visits increased 36% and 33% respectively versus the same quarter last year. At year-end we have 49 affiliations with major health systems across the country. We recently added two new affiliations, further expanding our platform that supports primary care both conveniently and cost effectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me update you on the progress that has been made at Red Oak Sourcing, our venture with Cardinal Health and we are extremely pleased with the rapid progress Red Oak has made to date. The combined expertise of the Red Oak team along with the simplicity of the business structure has enabled them to hit the ground running. They have been actively working with suppliers on strategies that create value for all parties and have now transition suppliers representing more than 95% of the combined generic spend. And as expected, we received the first fixed quarterly payment from Cardinal in the fourth quarter and we look forward to Red Oak\u2019s future contributions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me comment on the news surrounding Nexium. As you know, Teva recently received FDA approval for the generic and we\u2019ve received some questions on how that might impact our results. I just want to note that there are still many questions regarding the launch of generic Nexium, including potential legal maneuvers, the timing of launches, as well as the number of other manufacturers who could potentially launch. So we need clarity and answers for those questions before we can provide any more specifics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dave Denton</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Larry good morning everyone. This morning I'll provide a detailed review of our 2014 fourth quarter financial results and briefly touch upon our 2015 guidance, which remains unchanged from what we outlined back in December. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, I will start with the ramp-up of last year\u2019s capital allocation program, which would clearly demonstrate how we've been using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders through both dividends as well as share repurchases. I'm pleased to say that we have continued on our steady march of improving our dividend payout ratio. Recall that back in 2010 that our payout ratio was approximately 14%. We finished 2014 with the payout ratio of 27.7%, almost double 2010\u2019s level and four percentage points higher than 2013. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We paid approximately $1.3 billion in dividends in \u201914 and $317 million in the fourth quarter alone. Our strong earnings outlook for this year, combined with the 27% increase to dividend that we announced at Analyst Day puts us well on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 35% by 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now along with these significant increases in our dividends, we have also continued to do value enhancing share repurchases. For all of 2014, we have repurchased approximately 51 million shares for $4 billion, averaging $77.91 per share. In the fourth quarter alone we repurchased 14.1 million shares for $1.2 billion. So between dividends and share repurchases we have returned approximately $5.3 billion to our shareholders in 2014. And looking forward, we have $12.7 billion in authorization to repurchase shares and we continue to expect to repurchase $6 billion this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our expectation is that we will return more than $7 billion to our shareholder in 2015 through a combination of both dividends and share repurchases, which is up more than 30% over last year. We generated $2.9 billion of free cash in the fourth quarter and all of 2014 free cash flow increased $2.1 billion year-over-year to approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in cash generation was driven primarily by improvements in collections and payables management. These were partially offset by growth in inventory and current assets, as well as increased investments in capital associated with technology and other corporate efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have mentioned on our last earnings call that the 2014 free cash flow might exceed our guidance at the expense of 2015 guidance, and in fact we did in the year $500 million above the high-end of our goal. That was driven by the receipt of some late year payments a few days early. Despite the higher than anticipated receivable collections in \u201914, the underlying strength of our cash flow allows us to maintain our free cash flow guidance for this year of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Aside from these timing items within receivables we continue to make strides in improving our cash cycle to better management of payables and we have remained committed to further improvements in working capital as we look forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, our net capital expenditures were $1.6 billion. This included $2.1 billion of gross CapEx offset by $515 million in sale leaseback proceeds. And as for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at a $1.21 per share at the high-end of our guidance. GAAP to diluted EPS was a $1.14 per share. We saw strong results across our operating segments with retail posting results above the high-end of our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, let me quickly walk down the P&amp;L. On a consolidated basis revenues in the fourth quarter increased 12.9% to $37.1 billion. In the PBM segment net revenues increased 21.7% to $23.9 billion. This year-over-year growth was attributable to specialty pharmacy, including the impact of Coram and Specialty Connect as well as increased volumes in pharmacy network claims. Partially offsetting this growth was an increase in our generic dispensing rate, was grew approximately 125 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 82.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw strength on the top-line versus our guidance, due to primarily to higher volumes than expected, particularly in Medicaid, drug price inflation and mix including the new Hep C drugs. In our retail business revenues increased 2.9% in the quarter to $17.7 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy same-store sales growth despite the transition of specialty revenues in to the PBM segment due to Specialty Connect. Like the PBM, retail exceeded guidance due to higher volumes in pharmacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to gross margin, we reported 17.9% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a contraction of approximately 140 basis points, compared to Q4 \u201913 and consistent with our expectations. Within the PBM segment gross margins declined 100 basis points versus Q4 \u201913 to 5.2%, while gross profit dollars increased 2.2% year-over-year. The increase in gross profit dollars was primarily attributable to the increase in volumes, the improvement in GDR and favorable rebate economics. Partially offsetting these drivers was the impact of client and drug mix as well as continuing client pricing pressures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross margins for retail segment was 31.4%, up approximately 65 basis points over LY. This improvement was driven by the 140 basis point increase in retail GDR to 82.4%, the benefit to front store margins from the tobacco exit, increased store brand penetration as well as the first quarterly payment we received from Cardinal as part of the Red Oak sourcing venture. Partially offsetting these drivers was the continued pressure on reimbursement rates. Gross profit dollars increased 5.2% in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total operating expense as a percent of revenues notably improved from Q4 \u201913 to 11.6%. The PBM segment\u2019s SG&amp;A rate improved by 20 basis points to 1.4%. We spent more on 1/1 readiness for the PBM\u2019s welcome season than we expected; but with the over delivery of revenues in the quarter we were able to deliver the modest improvement we had planned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As reported, SG&amp;A as a percent of sales in the retail segment deteriorated by approximately 35 basis points to 21.3%. However this was driven by the reduction in retail sales related to our decision to exit the tobacco category as well as the impact of Specialty Connect shifting again sales from our retail segment into the PBM. On an underlying basis SG&amp;A as a percent of sales at retail actually improved by approximately 50 basis points. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $7 million to $205 million again within expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 50 basis points in the quarter to 6.3%. Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 80 basis points to 3.8% while operating margin at retail improved by approximately 35 basis points to 10.1%. For the quarter we exceeded our estimates for operating profit growth in the retail segment. Retail operating profit increased a solid 6.5% exceeding expectations by approximately 25 basis points. PBM operating profit increased 0.9%, in the middle of our guidance range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately $4 million from last year to $131 million. This was due primarily to lower average interest rates. Additionally our effective tax rate was 39.6%, our weighted average share count was 1.2 billion shares, only slightly higher than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, now let me touch on our 2015 guidance which remains unchanged from Analyst Day. You can find the details in the slide presentation we posted on our Web site but I\u2019ll focus on the highlights here. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share in \u201915 in the range of $5.05 to $5.19 a share reflecting very healthy year-over-year growth even after removing the impact in \u201914 related to the loss on the early extinguishment of debt. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.77 to $4.91 a share. We expect consolidated net revenue growth of 7% to 8.25% which reflect solid underlying growth across the enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Retail revenues are expected to increase by 1.25% to 2.5% despite the negative impact of the tobacco exit. Recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have a negative impact on total same store sales of approximately 175 basis points for the year and is expected to have a negative impact of approximately 575 basis points on front store cost for the year as well. While the impact last quarter was a bit better than we expected, it's only been a few months since we became tobacco free. So we\u2019re maintaining our initial guidance on the impact to our cost. We expect growth in PBM revenues of between 11% and 12.25%. We expect retail operating profit to increase 4.75% to 6.5% year-over-year and PBM operating profit to increase 6.75% to 10.75%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first quarter guidance also remains unchanged from what we talked about in December. As you may recall, we highlighted several timing factors back in Analyst Day that affect the cadence of profit delivery throughout this year. And while 2015 is expected to be a strong year, the cadence of profit growth is expected to be significantly back half weighted. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of a $1.06 to a $1.09 a share, reflecting growth of 4% to 7.25% versus the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $0.99 to a $1.02 in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Within the Retail segment, we continue to expect revenues to increase 1.5% to 3% and operating profit growth of between negative 1.5% to a positive 1.5% year-over-year. Recall that we expect the tobacco exit to have an approximately 900 basis point negative impact on front store comps in the first quarter. Now revenues in the PBM segment still are expected to grow between 14.5% to 15.75%, while operating profit growth is expected to be flat to down 5%. Additionally, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of between $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion and I\u2019ll remind you that we\u2019re maintaining that range despite the pull forward of some receivables into 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in closing, I'd like to reinforce with everyone two important thoughts. First, I continue to be very pleased with the Company\u2019s significant cash flow generation capabilities. I believe these capabilities should continue to play an important role in driving shareholder value over the longer-term. Second and to that point, 2015 will be another year in which we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning value to our shareholders, increasing the dividend and share buyback programs by more than 30% over last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Dave. And let me just reiterate how pleased we are with the progress that we\u2019ve made this past year in advancing our innovative healthcare strategies along with rebranding our company and I\u2019d like to take a minute to thank our more than 200,000 colleagues who continue to work hard each and every day executing those strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Jones </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the PBM side, I noticed EBITDA per claim was a little bit late in the quarter and down year-over-year. I know you said it increased spending. I'm wondering if you could comment on whether or not that spending was more of a pull forward for Jan 1 starts or something more incremental.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think increased spending was really related to the 1/1 readiness effort. So we spent as you know incremental money through Q4 and we talked about the incremental money that we\u2019re going to spend actually in Q1 as we ramp up those new clients for the welcome season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Jones </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the other thing you guys said, it was price compression around the EBITDA per claim. I know you mentioned that last quarter as well. I'm just wondering if you could shed any more light on what exactly that was? Is this something from previous PBM contracts or is it something more related to the new starts again?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bob, I think this is just the ongoing margin compression that we\u2019re continuing to see and expect to see as we move forward on both the PBM as well as the retail side. So there is nothing that is new beyond what we\u2019ve been talking about probably for the last couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Heinbockel </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So for Larry or John, if you guys dissect or try to dissect the upcoming \u201816 selling season in terms of size and then composition, how do you think that compares to 2015 and do you think -- are you better positioned for \u201916 given what we saw in \u201915 or about the same?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, it's Larry, I\u2019ll start and Jon will I'm sure jump in as well. But the latter part of your question, we think we\u2019re extremely well positioned for all the reasons that we touched on earlier and that we talked about in greater detail at Analyst Day. I think that if you go back and look at the \u201915 selling season over \u201914, there was a lot more RFP activity recognizing that we thought \u201914 was an anomaly, as people were preparing for the impact of the Affordable Care Act. So we think that \u201815 was kind of a return to a normal selling season and we don\u2019t see \u201916 any different. It's early but we think it's -- we think it will mirror what we saw this past year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And John, this is Jon. I think the size and composition is going to be similar to what we\u2019ve seen. Its health plans which we\u2019re seeing now, large employers that we\u2019re seeing now. You\u2019ll see the mid-sized and small importers later in the year and we expect to see a fair amount of state government opportunities as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Heinbockel </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, and then just one other thing. How do you guys think about capital allocation and buyback as it relates to share price valuation? Does that discussion come into effect at all, where you might think let\u2019s do more on the dividend side, let's consider a special dividend? Or is it really kind of a long-term view that over the long-term buying back $5 billion or $6 billion a year is really the right thing to do?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John its Dave. We've been pretty consistent on our capital allocation program for several years, and we've outlined it and all the different components of it. I will tell you though, we do look forward to the growth of our business. We look at where we think we're going to be in several years in the future, and then we make sure that we're performing what we would consider value enhancing share repurchases based on where the growth of our business and the cash generation capability of our business over the next several years compared to the evaluation. So we will continue to monitor that and we will continue to flex our capital allocation program to drive value for shareholders in the short-term as well as the long-term John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Your line is open, please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meredith Adler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric Percher and I have the question as well. I have a question just about expenses at retail. You did a good job of managing them. I'm just wondering if you actually had to make meaningful changes in labor hours or the way you had work done at the stores because you gave up tobacco and Specialty Connect or was that not actually something that you had to deal with?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Meredith, its Larry. I'll start and we have not been doing anything out of the norm that we haven\u2019t -- that hasn\u2019t been part of our program for the last couple of years. We have always looked for ways in which we can become a more efficient operator at retail and that\u2019s where our focus has been this past year and will continue to be as we go forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meredith Adler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the improvement is impressive. I will turn it over to Eric now. He has a question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Percher </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, a question on formulary. As you look at the 2016 selling season do you think your formulary decision around Hep C can stand as an advantage? I know you feel there is advantages to your formulary focus but do you think that specifically can and if so, does it beg the question, will we ever PBMs move to a point where there is such a delta in what is offered by each PBM, that a sponsor would choose their PBM based on product availability?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric its Larry. I'll start and I'm sure Jon will jump in as well. But as you think about Hep C specifically, our goal was to create the lowest net-cost solution for the entire population of patients, recognizing that our clients have a lot of flexibility in terms of the programs that we have that meets their priorities. And in addition to achieving the lowest net-cost solution, we also evaluated a variety of factors including the current and future projected distribution of a population across the several genotypes, the average duration of therapy of the various agents, factors that contribute to medication adherence along with our ability to further control cost through utilization management programs. And I go back to some of the things that we talk about at Analyst Day where through our formulary management program, since it started back in 2012 we have saved clients over $3.5 billion. There is a growing opportunity in the specialty class recognizing that I think we ended \u201914 with 31 specialty exclusions and, and there is a lot more that we can do to bend the cost curve in specialty beyond just managing the formulary. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe I'll ask Jon to talk a little more about that respective piece.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Eric clearly Specialties are client\u2019s biggest concerns. Formulary is a piece of that but there is also a lot of other things that you can do to help manage that trend, and then are also interested in managing it under the medical side which we have a unique solution. So I think formulary is one piece of the strategy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your question around the differences in formularies between the different PBMs and the impact on that as clients make decisions, we really haven\u2019t seen that as a factor in the selling season. We've been very effective the transitioning members off of non-formulary drugs. We've very effective at transitioning members from competitors' formularies to our formularies and we're seeing that this selling season. So I don\u2019t -- I am not seeing formulary as a differentiator as clients are making decisions. I think they're really looking at what we are able to deliver there, we're very competitive there. But they're also looking at all the other capabilities, differentiated capabilities that we have. And at the end of the day, that\u2019s what makes the difference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink Partners. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Larsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Congratulations on a good quarter. Was there an impact to gross margins in the retail division and pharmacy services division due to Specialty Connect? Was there a benefit to retail and a bit of a headwind to pharmacy services that can be sized out itself?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can\u2019t really size that. I will say that from a rate perspective, it is slightly beneficial to from a rate perspective to retail to think about those specialty prescriptions. They\u2019re largely branded prescriptions and branded prescriptions carry a lower gross margin than a generic prescription would. So that would serve to lift retail gross margins when you transfer those scripts out of retail into PBM [indiscernible]. It will immaterial though in totality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Larsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so you had like 67 bps of gross margin expansion in retail. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about generic inflation. One of your competitors has obviously been talking about rate pressures. It\u2019s not like the Specialty Connect had a huge impact on -- your performing well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, that is certainly not the driver of rate improvement at retail. You go back and you look at what\u2019s driving performance in retail, there continues to be gains in prescription volume along with the improvements in GDR and our improvements in economics as we drive down the cost from a procurement standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen Group. Your line is open please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have a question on -- I think you talked about earlier outperformance in retail pharmacy and that was all the more surprising because of the Specialty Connect transition. At this point is all Specialty drugs, that someone comes into the retail outlet, into the retail store, is that all being recorded in PBM? Are there any sort of categories that will still end up getting dispensed out of retail?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Almost all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then can you talk about what was driving the outperformance at the retail pharmacy side, then?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again if you go back, if you look at what\u2019s really driving it, it is our continued share gain from a pharmacy perspective. You look at the volumes of prescriptions going through our dispensing channel at retail continues to enhance our performance from that perspective?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Charles we mentioned and I\u2019ll go back to our prepared remarks, where we saw 55 basis point increase in pharmacy market share in the fourth quarter. We also acknowledge that there was a bit of an uptick from the flu season, that we began to see in the business in the later weeks in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. Was there anything on the mix though and was it more on Medicare or versus Commercial, any kind of color that you can provide there? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I don\u2019t think there was anything that was materially different than we\u2019ve seen in past quarters from that perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Biosimilars seems to be an area of focus in recent weeks and they may be on the market sooner than we previously expected. How should we think about the potential contribution of the biosimilar from PBM and retail perspective and maybe you can help us rank quarter as we think about where [indiscernible] is compared to contribution of specialty drugs with kind of [indiscernible] rebates like Hep C versus kind of like generics that are on the marketplace today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ricky this is Jon. Still early in this whole arena but I -- as I -- what I know today I would think about biosimilars as being more like branded competition. And so the majority of the value will come in the form of rebates and obviously most of that value passes along to our clients. Now to the extent that they\u2019re able to make them interchangeable and at function more like generics in the non-specialty world, then I think you would see them act more like generics. But I think it\u2019s early to see how that plays out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ricky Goldwasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just one thought on the Specialty. Obviously you raised a very interesting point about the fact that the [indiscernible] contribution that you\u2019re seeing, the way you can help manage Specialty is not just tied to formulary, and at the medical side represents a very nice opportunity. So when we think about kind of like your customer is buying Specialty though you and we think about the NovoLogix offering and what do you think is what is the -- or what percent of your [indiscernible] year-to-date ask you also to manage it on the medical side and how do you think that rent can progress over time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a good question. I would say Specialty on the medical side, most of that activity is concentrated with our health plan clients. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest in that space. Obviously as we begin to manage that we believe that increases are dispensing opportunities as well because some of those drugs can\u2019t be dispensed through us, and we think of our Coram platform is even being an enabler to penetrate the dispensing space to an even greater extent than what we do today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Ricky, I think to that point, the value proposition here centers around the ability to manage the Specialty patient, not simply the administration of a particular drug, recognizing that with the very fast that we now have Jon mentioned Coram and our infusion capabilities along with [indiscernible] to NovoLogix, we can demonstrate for the client cost savings opportunities by simply migrating the patient through a lower cost high quality side of service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.

Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Mushkin </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hopefully you're surviving the blizzard up there in the northeast. So more of a conceptual question. I was just kind of send back listening to the call, listening to you guys talk and remembering the Analyst Day, it seems to me if I look out over the next 12 to 24 months, there seems to be an upward bias to business performance and I wanted to see if you guys agree with that. I look at like kind of silver script, I look at Medicaid expense and Ohio did it, I look at the front end and the potential to up sell there with all the clinics that are coming in and just the volumes that are going into your pharmacies. So if you agree with that, that there does seem to be some upward momentum to your business as you look over the next 12 or 24 months?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Dave. Maybe I\u2019ll start. I think as we -- you heard at Analyst Day despite the fact that we come from a very large place in terms of the size of the Company, we have a lot of growth outlooks, and opportunities in our business where you outlined over the next five years of how we\u2019re going to grow the top-line fairly significantly, gaining share across both the PBM market space as well as the retail market space and be able through that share gain, be able to drive performance in operating profit and with the cash that we generate, be able to further enhance that through the capital allocation program. So I do think as we look at the marketplace there is always challenges in every marketplace but there is really a lot of opportunities for our differentiated model to plug in to payers and providers and consumers in ways that add value for them and quite frankly add value for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Scott, I mean it's a great question and I think Dave answered well. The only thing that I would add is there is still so much flux in the marketplace and back to Dave's explain about -- we\u2019ve got a multitude of assets that a while -- but we can be pretty nimble and I think we described that we can pivot to additional changes that we see in the marketplace in a pretty quick and innovative fashion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Mushkin </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So appreciate. And this is a follow-up same line under thinking. It also seems that the asset productivity is important to you guys and it does seem even though there is margin pressure, that the outflow of money into asset doesn\u2019t have to be huge and so we could get some continued increase in ROIC. Do you agree with that as well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I do. I think if you look at what we\u2019re trying to do here is as we gain dispensing share -- that dispensing share can be -- we can essentially leverage the fixed asset infrastructure of our business both at the Retail segment as well as in the PBM space and that really allows us to accelerate our returns profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Hill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I have a question about what I'm going to call your clairvoyance, because one of things that I would -- I guess do you guys -- in this case you guys seem to be able to see the future. Because when we went to your Analyst Day in mid-December, I'm intrigued that the PBM guidance doesn\u2019t move a basis point despite all the gyrations in the Hep C market. So I guess my question is as we think about that, in early December did you guys know this was coming? Did you guys -- did this all play out exactly how you guys thought? Other angles are does it not move the needle, does it not impact enough scripts, or the rebate is not big enough, is the amount of money that you are make in Hep C not big enough to move the needle? Not even at the revenue line, it doesn\u2019t move the needle. So I guess -- maybe this is a planning question, maybe this is a process question, maybe this is a market question, but I guess can you just give us some color on the background of Hep C and how it will kind of -- it all obviously played out exactly according to your expectations?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, George, it's Larry. I\u2019ll start and then I'm sure Dave will jump in. But we appreciate your comments. I would say that as we\u2019re doing our planning, our outlook and our guidance range implies a range of assumptions and I think I would say that at the end of the day it\u2019s that simple; that as we talk about our outlook for \u201915, we've got within that guidance range of $0.14, it comprehends where the market could go. And as we talked about this morning we're comfortable with where we're at today and that outlook remains intact. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would I think also George, just from that perspective, it relates let\u2019s say Specialty in Hep C, we've been planning for this event for a while. This wasn\u2019t like a shock to us. We had a lot of experience in this category. We have been working hard with clients and within our organization to better manage Specialty for them. We see the pipeline we have a good view of the pipeline and with the constructed a series of programs that allowed us to work to improve our performance in this area on behalf of our clients. And so this was something that was very plain fold from our perspective and we saw it coming to some degree. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Hill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, and the quick follow-up then would be is this how the Hep C market evolved in late December early January? Is there anything different from that playbook that's different from the playbook with how we thought about the Statin class or how we should think about drugs going forward? We got a lot of questions about -- I guess we've gotten a got a lot of questions about this space. To us it\u2019s just a regular PBM playbook. I guess from your perspective in Hep C, was there anything different in the way this kind of all unfolded?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t think there is much difference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And George, I think this all go back to when we started this in 2011 for the 2000 plan year. I think that we demonstrated in that first year that this can be a cost save -- a very effective cost savings opportunity for clients and it can be executed at -- with a high degree of service to the members, and certainly this whole process starts with ensuring appropriate clinical outcomes. And I think we continue to see those opportunities going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">George the only thing that I would say is different as we move into the Specialty realm is there will be more complexity around managing it. So as an example Harvoni is for genotype 1. And so that\u2019s whats on a formulary for those patients that have to Hep C with genotype 1 and then you have other options for the other genotypes. And so I think you will see a combination of formulary and utilization management programs. So that just adds a little bit complexity but I agree with Dave and Larry. It\u2019s very similar what we have seen in the past and our capabilities are playing out in this space as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is open, please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lisa Gill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about plan design for 2015. As we talked to some of your clients in our annual surveys in December, people talked about minuteclinic, they also talked about maintenance -- obviously we talked a lot about Specialty today and that was clearly one of the things that came out when we talked to clients as well. But can you maybe just talk about some of the other things that are changing for January 1, 2015 and you talked about spending a lot of dollars and time around implementation. What were some other changes that came about from a plan design perspective?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lisa I think it was just more of the same, more penetration and high deductible plans and just higher penetration of all the things that you just talked about. So we really haven\u2019t seen anything different than that, although I will think -- I do think you'll see much more aggressive management in the specialty space around the plan designs. So much higher adoption of formulary strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think as you recall at Analyst Day, we did talk about -- of the new business we brought on board 35% adopted some narrow network. So I think you're just going to see more aggressive programs like this with plan designs as clients begin to see these higher trends, year-over-year growth for their drug spends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lisa Gill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, and then my follow-up question Dave was around Red Oak. On the generic percentage you talked about the payment from Cardinal but did you see any incremental savings in addition to the payment that you saw from Cardinal?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes we did. As we said we're kind of in the early stages of that effort. As we indicated back at Analyst Day there is several different ways in which we drive economics here. Part of that is lowering our cost-of-goods sold from Red Oak and we did see some improvement based on the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lisa Gill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is there a way to quantify that or you're done quantifying it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is way to quantify but unfortunately we're not going to quantify it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Frank Morgan from RBC. Your line is open, please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Frank Morgan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was curious when you gave your guidance back in December at Analyst Day, what did you contemplate at that point in time regarding discounts related to Hep C?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank that\u2019s also a great question that unfortunately we can\u2019t get into that level of specificity. But we -- as we talked about earlier, our guidance as we thought about 2015 had a range of -- kind of has a range of scenarios built within it and at that point in time we had some clarity around kind of how the market was going to shape up for us there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Frank Morgan </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, and as you think -- a lot of discussion today about the specialty and different strategies. Are there any pieces that you are missing strategically that you feel like you need on the specialty side in terms of as new drugs come to market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Frank that's a great question. I don\u2019t know that there is any -- we don\u2019t really have any gaps from an asset perspective. I will tell you though that we\u2019ve been working hard to increase our business within the medical benefit management sector if you will with NovoLogix as a good example. There's probably other opportunities for us to continue to penetrate that market. So there's probably more to come there. We're probably really early stages from that perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank this is Jon. The one space we don\u2019t play in much today is the oncology space. Most of that is administered in physician offices. We do think as the marketplace moves to more risk based reimbursement arrangements that that business will view the administration of drugs -- they view it as a profit center today and as it becomes more risk based, that will become an expense center for them. So they\u2019ll be looking for solutions and people that can operate in that space more effective. So we\u2019re working hard to understand how to extend into that space and we think our capabilities give us a great, great platform to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alvin Concepcion from Citi. Your line is open please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alvin Concepcion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple of quick ones. Just a follow up on the Red Oak question. How would you characterize the savings that you talked about versus what you would have expected at this point in time? And then just the follow up is on generic inflation. What are you seeing there? And what is your outlook for the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take generic inflation first. As we have said there has been limited pockets of inflation within the generic universe. I won\u2019t say that in totality the generic markets still maintains a very deflationary nature, and we believe that that will continue both in the short-term as well as the long term. I think as it relates to Red Oak, I think the team has done terrific job in standing up that operation. They've met with the lion's share of manufacturers and we continue to be pleased with the progress. I think that they\u2019re tracking consistent as we plan for them as this point in time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Alvin, I think I\u2019d just reiterate the three ways in which value is created with Red Oak. Obviously one is the fixed payment schedule which started in Q4. The second one is there are some additional milestones that have been created that will allow for additional payments. And then the third is what Dave alluded to on an earlier question in terms of just the opportunity to create additional reductions in the cost of goods by creating a more efficient supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from UBS. Your line is open please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Valiquette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I don\u2019t know if I missed this but was there any general color on the mix of the $0.4 billion in additional PBM selling season between health plans and employers or government contracts?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. Steve, it was more just general mix, probably maybe it skews a little more to the health plan size recognizing some of the true ups that take place from their enrolment season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Valiquette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, and then separately just quickly 0.5 million additional PDP liability that you mentioned for early \u201915, is that net of any Medicare retiree business that you talked about at the Analyst Day that you may have lost to public exchanges, or do those particular member losses show up in a separate bucket somewhere else?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steve, that\u2019s great question and that is a net number inclusive of the variables that you talked about. And so -- and by the way you can go back to one of Jon\u2019s slide's at Analyst Day that kind of did the mapping from where we were to what we were projecting, including the shift in retirees, what we were projecting open enrollment at that point in time and it came -- the final net number was pretty close to that forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Your line is open please proceed with your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Bosshard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two things. First of all, just a follow on with Red Oak. Curious on what inning you would say you\u2019re in in terms of realizing the purchasing benefits from that effort?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric I would say we\u2019re probably in the fourth or fifth inning in terms of the work and the opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Eric, this is Dave. The one thing I would -- just one word of caution there is that this isn\u2019t a game where there I think is a beginning and an end. This is a process that is ongoing continuously. So while we might have got to the fourth inning as Larry just spoke about, we\u2019re going to start a new game soon enough and we continually need to work to improve our cost structure and that\u2019s one way we'll do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Bosshard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly, there was some conversation earlier about the 2016 selling season and the composition and it sounded like you suggested that the opportunity was similar to that what you enjoyed in \u201915. I'm just wondering if you could talk a bit further about -- \u201915 was obviously a great success. If that is obviously you aspire to repeat that in \u201916, but is that reasonable to think that you could achieve a similar level of success in \u201916 relative to what you did for \u201915?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric, I think there is two comments around that, and first is the fact that as we\u2019ve been talking a lot about over the last couple of years, the differentiation that the integrated model brings out into the marketplace and how we think that we can meet clients' needs for their business and obviously their members in a very differentiated way in terms of satisfying their goals and I think as we\u2019re talking -- as we\u2019re thinking about the \u201916 selling season, I think based on where we sit today it really has more to do with -- we expect the RFP activity to be at a similar level to what we experienced last year. So obviously it's very early and we\u2019ll talk more about it as we go through the year, but we\u2019re optimistic as a result of our integrated model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Willoughby </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Larry, have you assumed any change in strategy at your number one retail competitor? What might you do differently this year to take advantage of any disruption or how might you be disadvantaged?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes Bob, its Larry. Maybe I\u2019ll start and then just ask Helena to jump in as well and Bob, I think our focus continues to be on our business and what we can manage and control within the four walls of what we do well every day and the opportunities that we continue to see there. And maybe I\u2019ll ask Helena just to talk more about how she is thinking about the retail business and the opportunities that exist there within CVS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Helena Foulkes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think it's a good time for us and opportunity for us, just given what\u2019s going on in these -- the one thing we haven\u2019t talked that yet this morning is just the successful launch of this new CVS Health brand, which is definitely resonating with consumers, that we\u2019re seeing about 1,100 basis point increase in their awareness of CVS Health and consumers are really seeing our Company as a leader in healthcare. And so that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re hoping for and we\u2019re using that momentum to focus on health and beauty as we talked about at Analyst Day. And just keeping our eye on the ball and running the business and -- all of that will come to good outcome for CVS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of John Ransom from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Ransom </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple of quick ones. First of all assuming Nexium goes non-exclusive as a multisource David, is there any reason to assume as you said in the past that that\u2019s kind of the best of all worlds for you as it blows right through exclusivity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dave Denton</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it's hard to say specifically but my expectation, as we've always said is that we\u2019re most advantaged at the point in which there is many manufacturers in the market for a generic drug and if that were to occur, I assume that that would be best for us, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Ransom </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And secondly, I am curious about -- everybody just on specialty differently, but I'm curious about what you're telling your clients., So maybe this is a question for Jon. Once we lap the Sovaldi spike what the Specialty trend looks like from there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have the PCSK9 inhibitors coming out this summer that could be as big, could potentially be even bigger than Hep C. So pharma is really focused in the space. So I think this is going to be an ongoing challenge for our clients and an opportunity for us to step in and really help them manage this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve been communicating with clients that left unabated you can expect to see Specialty trends in the high-teens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Edward Kelly</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Larry you mentioned that you\u2019ve taken a disciplined approach to preferred Part D networks. I was just hoping if maybe you can give us a little bit more color on that angle, given the marketplace does seem to be competitive, and how important it is for you to have a material presence in that business long-term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ed, it's a great question. And it is important for us to have a presence in that business which we believe we have today, recognizing all the different ways in which we can engage and touch the Medicare consumer. And you go back to some of the things that we have talked about, we coined it silver tsunami, the fact you have got 10,000 baby boomers turning 365 [ph] every day. Back to your first question, the competitive recognizes that participation in a preferred network comes with associated margin compression. And I think our retail organization has done a terrific job in terms of building an economic model that evaluates margin compression against forecasted share shift. And there are times when the economics make sense and we proceed and there are other times where the economics don\u2019t make sense. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recognizing that all part D plans are not equal in terms of their design, whether it\u2019s co-pays or the makeup of that Part D plan in terms of balance between choosers and low income subsidies. I think at the same time we also have a unique opportunity recognizing that you saw the announcements coming out of HHS last week and the focus in terms of moving more to outcomes management. We participate today in terms of supporting our health plan clients through stars ratings and we know that in a PDP plan we can affect over 50% of that stars ratings with the ways in which we engage and touch that patient. So we think that there is tremendous opportunities across our book of business to work with patients as well as health plan clients in terms of achieving their goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our last question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Muken </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I'm curious building a little off of what Helena said and then also just kind of going back to tobacco, what have been sort of the key things that both the tobacco decision as well as the rebranding have kind of given you from an enterprise perspective that maybe you weren\u2019t looking for originally and has there been anything sort of unsuspecting that has been something that\u2019s been more challenging to sort of offset the headwind. I'm just trying to see what was assumed and how it sort of developed either positively or negatively?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Helena Foulkes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Dave and Larry have said, we're pleased with where we are now. There was certainly a lot of moving parts and it's hard for us to really identify what was driving what. But I'd say in terms of surprises, probably things like to the extent which are 200,000 colleagues feel incredibly proud about this decision, we thought they would but it\u2019s really driven a very a ostensive excitement I would say among the organization, a sense of pride to work for Company that would make a decision like that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The branding I think has been, as I said before, it\u2019s been successful and it\u2019s making people think differently about the Company and what we're trying to do is say to consumers we're not just like any drug store or any corner. We're part of a big healthcare company. And when they see all of the assets that we have and understand all that we do, they start to think about it very differently. So that\u2019s been a really exciting part of this decision as well. And I also think that internally for our merchants, it\u2019s given them a sense of where do we go from here. I mentioned at Analyst Day all that we're doing around healthy food and health and beauty and it's given them an even stronger sense of purpose to drive those business. That\u2019s really what we are focused on. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Roberts</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Ross, this is Jon to add to that. As I'm out talking and I'll focus on new perspective clients that maybe don\u2019t know us as well as our existing clients, it\u2019s something that we talk about, our repositioning in the marketplace as a healthcare provider, the discontinuation of tobacco. And there is clearly a halo effect that I see from our clients that makes them feel good about potentially doing business with the company that has taken a stand like that in the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Merlo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Ross I'll warp-it up by talking about the provider, the physician community, and I think that we've seen this come into play as we think about some of the health system affiliations that we alluded to in the call, and this certainly aligns us with their goals as well. And I think it\u2019s opening up some doors to -- some potentially unique opportunities as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again let me just take a minute and thank everybody for their time this morning and your ongoing interest in CVS Health.
