[Operator instructions.] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded on Tuesday November 5, 2013. Is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, senior VP, investor relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Christal.</p> <p><strong>Nancy Christal</strong></p> <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m here this morning with Larry Merlo, president and CEO, who will provide a business update, and Dave Denton, executive vice president and CFO, who will review our third quarter results and guidance. John Roberts, president of PBM is also with us today and will participate in the question and answer session following our prepared remarks. Mark Cosby, president of the retail business, was planning to join us, but is under the weather and not able to be here today. </p> <p>During the Q&amp;A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow up so we can provide more callers with the chance to ask their questions. </p> <p>I have one important reminder today, on Wednesday, December 18, we\u2019ll host our 2013 analyst day<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> in New York City. At that time, we\u2019ll provide 2014 guidance and some longer term financial targets as well as a comprehensive update on our strategies for achieving those growth targets. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">You\u2019ll have the opportunity to hear from several members of our senior management team about our<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> PBM, specialty, retail, and MinuteClinic businesses, along with numerous enterprise wide initiatives that will capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and drive future growth. If you didn\u2019t reply to your invitation, please let us know if you plan to be there, as space is filing up quickly. The meeting will be webcast for those unable to attend in person, but we do hope to see many of you there on December 18.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to this morning\u2019s news, we posted a slide presentation on our website just before this call which summarizes the information you will hear today, as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. I encourage you to review the slides. Additionally, we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q by the close of business today, and it will be available through our website at that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During this call, we\u2019ll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company\u2019s performance, mainly free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And, as always, today\u2019s call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call for one year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we\u2019ll make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our upcoming quarterly report on Form 10-Q.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now I\u2019ll turn this over to Larry Merlo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Nancy. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Now, given that our analyst day is next month, our business update this morning will be brief. However, I do want to take some time to cover some of the topics that I know are top of mind in the marketplace, such as the impact of the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But before we get to that, let\u2019s kick things off with today\u2019s earnings, because we\u2019re pleased to report that we posted solid third quarter results across the enterprise. Overall operating profit increased more than 15%, with the PBM and retail businesses growing approximately 28% and 8% respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it\u2019s important to note that excludes the benefit from a legal settlement that was finalized during the third quarter. That settlement related to a prescription drug antitrust lawsuit with a drug manufacturer. We recorded a $72 million gain within operating expenses, which equates to a $0.04 per share benefit in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, that said, adjusted earnings per share excluding the legal settlement came in at $1.05 for the quarter, and that\u2019s $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. We also generated a substantial amount of free cash and year to date the total now stands at $3.1 billion and consistent with our goal at the beginning of the year, we remain committed to returning about $5 billion to our shareholders this year through both dividends and share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Considering our strong operating results to date, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising and narrowing our earnings guidance for full year \u201913 to a range of $3.94 to $3.97, and that\u2019s a change from our previous range of $3.90 to $3.96. And again, that\u2019s excluding the $0.04 benefit from the legal settlement. Dave will discuss our results and guidance in more detail during his financial review. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let me address some of the topics of interest that I alluded to earlier. I think as everyone knows, the healthcare environment is changing rapidly, and there are certainly a number of moving parts, from the Affordable Care Act to the private exchanges, and collectively we expect changes within this environment to be a net positive for our business in 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me walk you through the multiple ways that we\u2019ll continue to grow our business in this evolving landscape. First, we\u2019ll participate in coverage expansion and the public exchanges, as well as Medicaid. Second, we\u2019ll participate in the private exchange market for both active employees and retirees. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that our opportunities to participate are not limited to just our PBM, but span across our entire enterprise to include both our retail pharmacies, along with our MinuteClinic businesses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let\u2019s drill down a little further through our PBM, because we\u2019ll participate in the public exchanges through our health plan clients on a carve-in basis, where the health plan offers integrated medical and pharmacy benefits and we provide the PBM services. In fact, our health plan client footprint spans 25 states covering nearly 70% of the eligible exchange population.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, as the number one PBM player in the managed Medicaid space, we\u2019re also very well positioned to gain share through Medicaid expansion, and we certainly understand what these clients require. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the private exchanges, we\u2019ll participate through both a carve-in basis - again through our health plan clients - as well as on a carve-out basis as a standalone PBM where we have direct prescription benefit offerings on the exchange products. And we are well-positioned to win lives on the exchanges given our unique products and services as well as our trusted brand and name recognition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Within the private exchanges, we\u2019ll also play an important role in providing coverage to retirees through our Silver Script prescription drug plan, as well as our health plan clients\u2019 PDP and MAPD businesses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, there\u2019s certainly been a lot of speculation about what various employers are going to do with their populations, recognizing and acknowledging that large employers cannot participate on the public exchanges until 2017. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the fact is that less than 1% of covered lives are expected to move to private exchange products in 2014. And based on conversations we have had with our PBM clients and private exchange partners, we believe that most large employers are taking a wait and see approach to private exchanges, particularly with their active employees. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, we recently had a meeting with our client advisory group, and they told us that they feel they can manage costs effectively in their own environment while still maintaining both control and flexibility. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That said, large employers may consider moving their retirees to the exchanges over time, and we may see more movement to private exchanges by smaller employers over the next few years, because the exchanges do offer a way to reduce administrative burdens. However, I want to emphasize the point that we are very well positioned to gain lives and market share in the exchange products. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recently, you have also been asking about the impact all of this will have on PBM margins. And as we\u2019ve stated previously, we do expect to see some churn in PBM lives as some members may move from the employer bucket to the health plan bucket, and although this may result in margin compression in some instances, we expect this will be mitigated by cost management tools such as narrow networks, our proprietary Maintenance Choice offering, narrow formularies, step therapies, and the list goes on. And as a result, we do not expect a material impact on PBM margins in the foreseeable future. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to tighter pharmacy management tools, we also expect share gains from both market expansion and market churn as an additional lever to help offset PBM margin compression. And as I mentioned again, we\u2019re well-positioned to win lives on the exchanges given our unique products and services, along with our trusted brand and name recognition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I also mentioned it\u2019s important to remember that the opportunities from healthcare reform go well beyond our PBM, because our consumer expertise in the new business to consumer world of healthcare is being welcomed by health plans across the country, and leveraging our retail footprint, we can support healthcare marketing initiatives ranging from limited pilot marketing programs to full-scale educational programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fact, over the next six months, we expect health plans to host more than 6,000 marketing events in more than 1,000 of our stores across 20 states. Some of these health plan partnerships also include participation in preferred or restricted retail pharmacy networks and many are taking advantage of the convenient and affordable MinuteClinic services as well as cost-saving PBM services and programs to better manage the specialty pharmacy segment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on top of these opportunities, our retail business will obviously benefit from the expansion of coverage along with our ability to drive incremental scripts through our fixed retail cost structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So while there are a lot of moving parts, all things considered, we\u2019re very well positioned and we\u2019ll certainly provide more specific context around our assumptions for the newly covered lives and pharmacy utilization that we expect from reform when we provide our guidance next month at analyst day. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, let me quickly review some highlights on the PBM business. We\u2019ve had a strong 2014 selling season, despite the fact that the number of RFPs were down year over year. To date, we\u2019ve completed 75% of renewals, and we have a retention rate of 96%. Our gross sales wins currently total $5.1 billion, with net new business of about $1.8 billion. And remember that this net new business excludes any impact from attrition in our Medicare Part D PDP business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now with regard to the sanction imposed by CMS earlier this year, as we\u2019ve talked about previously, it has prevented us from marketing our Silver Script PDP or enrolling new members. And recall that the sanction primarily affects our individual Silver Script prescription drug product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today we have about 3.3 million Silver Script lives and we expect to have roughly 3 million lives in our individual Silver Script PDP by the end of January \u201914. On our last call, we said that we expected our remediation efforts to be complete sometime near the end of the year, and we expect to meet that target. And once complete, the next step will be for CMS to conduct its review to determine whether the issues have been fixed, are not likely to recur, and ultimately CMS will determine when the sanction will be lifted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we\u2019re obviously disappointed that we have not been able to participate in the open enrollment period, it is important to remember that we still see significant opportunity to grow our Med D business over the long term. And we believe that the changes that we have made to strengthen the Med D management team, along with the remediation steps that we\u2019ve taken will allow us to do just that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, on the heels of a successful 2014 selling season in our commercial PBM business, work has already begun on the 2015 selling season, and as all of you know, we have a long term strategic agreement with Aetna to provide their PBM services. And I\u2019m happy to report that we have successfully completed the 2015 market check with Aetna, and we look forward to continuing our strong and mutually beneficial relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m also very pleased that we have successfully completed the migration of Aetna\u2019s commercial business to the CVS Caremark platform. That\u2019s pretty significant, since it means that more clients will have access to CVS Caremark\u2019s differentiated offerings. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our joint efforts with the Aetna sales team have been successful to date, with numerous clients adopting our unique offerings, like Maintenance Choice, like Pharmacy Advisor, and we\u2019re also working closely with Aetna to implement and administer their exchange offerings and other government programs resulting from the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to our specialty business, growth was strong. Revenue\u2019s up approximately 22% year over year. This growth was driven by drug price inflation, utilization, new product launches, and new PBM clients. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At our recent client forum, many of our clients expressed concerns about the rapid growth in specialty pharmacy costs, and they are increasingly open to new ideas and solutions that address the escalating growth in specialty, and we certainly view this as a significant opportunity. And you\u2019ll hear more about our strategies to help clients manage the specialty trend next month at analyst day. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to the retail business, we had another solid quarter. Total same-store sales increased 3.6% while pharmacy same-store sales increased a very healthy 5.7%. Pharmacy same-store sales were negatively impacted by about 320 basis points due to recent generic introductions, and that\u2019s about half of the 670 basis point impact that we saw in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pharmacy same-store scripts increased 1.4% when counting 90-day scripts as one. It increased 4.5% on a 30-day equivalent basis. And we have seen a greater than historical rate of conversion to 90-day from 30-day scripts. And that\u2019s being driven by the continued strong growth in our Maintenance Choice programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m also pleased to report that the retention of scripts gained during last year\u2019s impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts continues to exceed our expectations. As you know, our goal was to retain at least 60% of those scripts this year and we are ahead of that goal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As for the front store business, comps decreased 1%, reflecting a decline in traffic. At the same time, we saw continued increase in basket size, as well as modestly higher front store margins. Our ExtraCare loyalty card continues to enable us to personalize our offers, creating more value for customers and gaining a bigger share of their wallet. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fact, this quarter we launched the My Weekly ad, a first of its kind personalized digital circular experience that taps into ExtraCare insights. And the My Weekly ad provides a unique weekly circular for every customer that\u2019s geared to their shopping preferences, saving them both time and money. We hope you\u2019ll log on and give it a try and we\u2019ll speak more about this on analyst day. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As for new stores, we opened 71 new or relocated stores, closed one during the quarter, resulting 48 net new stores in Q3, and this keeps us on track to achieve our 2-3% square footage growth target for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me turn briefly to MinuteClinic, which posted a revenue growth of 18% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. We opened 42 net new clinics in the quarter, including clinics in two new states, Hawaii and Louisiana, ending Q3 with 726 clinics in 27 states and the District of Columbia. And our long term goal is to create a platform that supports primary care by providing integrated, high-quality care that is convenient, accessible, and affordable. And we\u2019ll talk more about that next month as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Larry. Good morning everyone. Before turning to our results and our guidance, I want to highlight how our disciplined capital allocation program continues to enhance shareholder value. And during the third quarter, we paid approximately $276 million in dividends, bringing our year to date payout to $829 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, we repurchased approximately 25.8 million shares for $1.5 billion in the quarter, at an average price of $58.98 per share. Year to date, we\u2019ve repurchased 39.6 million shares for approximately $2.3 billion, again at an average price of $57.33.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see, the pace of buybacks accelerated throughout the third quarter, and we remain on track to complete approximately $4 billion of share repurchase in \u201913, which is also included in our guidance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So between dividends and share repurchases, we have returned more than $3.1 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters of this year alone and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve also generated approximately $3.1 billion of free cash flow through September of this year. Improving our cash generation capabilities through improved working capital management remains an area of focus for us. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And over the past several years, we\u2019ve made excellent progress in reducing our cash cycle. As previously noted, we have some timing issues with respect to CMS payables and receivables that may affect our working capital and delivery of free cash flow for the year. Even so, we are maintaining our guidance of free cash flow of between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion this year, while we work to offset this headwind to our target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As for the income statement, third quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.05 per share was approximately $0.02 above the high end of our guidance, after removing the pre-tax gain of $72 million from the legal settlement. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP diluted EPS was $1.03 per share, including the $0.04 from the legal settlement. Earnings were higher than expected, primarily due to the outperformance in the PBM, a favorable tax rate, and a weighted average share count that was slightly lower than planned. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let me quickly walk you through our results. On a consolidated basis, revenues in the third quarter increased 5.8% or approximately $1.7 billion to $32 billion. This exceeded the top of our guidance range, again driven by the PBM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">PBM net revenues increased 7.8%, or approximately $1.4 billion, to $19.5 billion. This growth was more than 225 basis points above the high end of our guidance, and was driven by higher than anticipated claims volume, primarily from Maintenance Choice, as well as higher inflation within our specialty business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Script utilization trends were consistent with prior periods, and we saw increased utilization of the retail network and in Maintenance Choice claims, offset by declining trends in core mail order. Claims growth year over year was driven by net new client wins and increased membership within our existing book of business. Specialty pharmacy was also a key driver. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slightly offsetting these positive revenue drivers was a strong GDR, which is obviously good for the bottom line. The PBM\u2019s generic dispensing rate increased 170 basis points versus the same quarter of last year to 81%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Note that starting with Q1 of this year, the sequential year over year rate of increase continues to slow from the high point of approximately 500 basis points in Q4 of last year to 170 basis points this quarter. This trend is expected to continue throughout Q4 of this year, given that fewer generic conversions are expected for the remainder of this year versus last year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenues in the retail business increased 5% in the quarter, or approximately $780 million, to $16.3 billion. As with the PBM, Maintenance Choice adoption was better than expected and helped drive overall performance to near the higher end of expectations. Like the PBM, new generic introductions negatively impacted retail sales, with our retail GDR increasing approximately 160 basis points versus the third quarter of \u201912, to 81.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to gross margins, we reported 18.9% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of approximately 20 basis points compared to Q3 of \u201912. Within the PBM segment, gross margins increased by approximately 65 basis points versus the second quarter of last year to 6.6% while gross profit dollars increased approximately 20% year over year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The increase in margin rate year over year was primarily driven by better acquisition cost, rebate economics, timing of our Medicare Part D PDP margins, as well as the increase in GDR. The increase in margin dollars was driven by higher volumes from new clients and new members and higher specialty volumes versus the third quarter of last year as well as the shift of Medicare Part D profitability from Q4 into Q3 of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These positive drivers were partially offset by price compression as well as remediation and operating costs within our Medicare Part D business. Gross margin for the retail segment was 30%, down about 15 basis points from last year, while gross profit dollars increased 4.5% year over year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given that pharmacy growth was stronger than front store growth in the quarter, pharmacy revenues as a percentage of total retail revenues increased by about 135 basis points. This shift in the business mix was the main driver of the climb in the overall retail margin rate since gross margins in the pharmacy business are lower than that in the front. Partially offsetting this was the increase in GDR as the continued increase in front store margins. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding the positive impact of the legal settlement, total consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of revenues improved versus the third quarter of \u201912 by approximately 35 basis points to 12.3% while total SG&amp;A dollars grew by 2.9%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The PBM segment SG&amp;A rate improved by about 15 basis points to 1.5%, excluding the benefit of the $11 million settlement. PBM expenses declined approximately $4 million from the third quarter of last year, and this reflects reduced spending on the streamlining initiative as the project nears completion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the retail segment, solid expense control resulted in an improvement in SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales of 40 basis points to 21.3%, excluding the $61 million from the legal settlement. Overall retail SG&amp;A expenses grew by about 3.1%. Within the corporate segment, expenses increased by approximately $10 million to $179 million. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, operating expenses were flat. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adding it all up and excluding the impact of the legal settlement, operating margins for the total enterprise improved approximately 55 basis points to 6.5%. Operating margins in the PBM improved 80 basis points to 5.1% while operating margin at retail improved by 25 basis points to 8.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the quarter, we were comfortably within the high end of our guidance for operating profit growth in the retail segment, while we exceeded our expectations in the PBM. Excluding the benefit from the legal segment, retail operating profit increased a very healthy 8.2% while PBM operating profits increased a very strong 27.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately $12 million from last quarter, to $122 million. The debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter of last year continues to be the primary driver of the year over year decrease each quarter. Additionally, our effective tax rate was 38.2%, which was slightly better than we expected, and our weighted average share count was slightly lower than anticipated, at about $1.23 billion shares for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So now let me turn to our 2013 guidance, which we both raised and narrowed this morning. Excluding the impact of the legal settlement in the third quarter, we currently expect to deliver adjusted earnings per share of $3.94 to $3.97 for 2013, reflecting strong year over year growth of 14.75% to 15.75%, after removing the impact in 2012 of the early extinguishment of debt to make the numbers more comparable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $3.73 to $3.76 per share. Our revised guidance reflects our solid performance for the first nine months of this year as well as our confidence in our outlook. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Embedded in this guidance are share repurchases totaling approximately $4 billion for the year, including shares from a $1.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we began on October 1. The details of the program will be available in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let me walk you through our fourth quarter guidance. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.09 per share to $1.12 per share, down 1.5% to 4.25% from Q4 of \u201912 after removing the impact from last year\u2019s fourth quarter resulting from the early extinguishment of debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP EPS from continuing operations is expected to in the range of $1.03 per share to $1.06 per share. As I said on our last quarterly call, we expect the fourth quarter to be somewhat atypical this year, driven mostly by the timing of break open generics and by Med D profits in the PBM. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to Medicare Part D, as I noted on our last earnings call, we are seeing a shift of profitability within the business from Q4, which has historically been our most profitable Med D quarter into Q3. A number of factors are affecting this, predominantly changes in earned rebates and the mix of the business across our Silver Script Choice versus our Silver Script Basic plan, as well as the impact of the sanction. As such, we expect the PBM segment\u2019s operating profit to decline by 15% to 18% in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect the retail segment\u2019s operating profit to increase 2.75% to 4.5% in the quarter, driven by gains in both the front store as well as the pharmacy. For the PBM segment, we expect revenues to increase 3.5% to 5% for the fourth quarter and adjusted claims to be between $262 million and $265 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the retail segment, we expect revenue to increase 3.5% to 5%, with same-store sales to increase 2.25% to 3.75%. Same-store scripts are expected to increase 0.5% to 1.5% while adjusted script comps are forecasted to be between 3% and 4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now as a result, for the total enterprise in the quarter we expect revenues to be up approximately 2.75% to 4.25% from the fourth quarter of \u201912. This is after intercompany eliminations, which are projected to equal about 10.6% of combined segment revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the total company, gross profit margins are expected to be down significantly from last year\u2019s fourth quarter, as both the retail and PBM segments will experience contraction. Expectations are that gross margin in the retail segment will be notably down due to fewer new generics available to offset continued reimbursement pressure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross margins in the PBM segment will be significantly down, due in large part to the timing of Medicare Part D profitability, but also due to fewer break open new generics to offset pricing pressures. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These trends are occurring as expected, as we lap a large amount of break open generics in 2012. For the total company, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to moderately improve in the fourth quarter. PBM operating expenses should show modest improvement, driven in part by a reduction of streamlining costs year over year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Retail expense leverage should notably improve, and upturn from recent trends largely due to the fact that there are fewer new generics and therefore less deleveraging of expenses. And we expect operating expenses from the corporate segment to be between $190 million and $195 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect operating margin for the total company in the quarter to be down 60 to 70 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter. We expect net interest expense of between $130 million and $135 million, and a tax rate of approximately 39% in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We anticipate that we will have approximately 1.2 billion weighted average shares for the quarter, which would imply approximately 1.23 billion for the year. And as I said, we continue to expect to generate free cash flow in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion, and we remain focused on using our strong free cash flow to drive shareholder value now as well as into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I will turn it back over to Larry Merlo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Dave. And just to sum things up, obviously we\u2019re pleased with our strong third quarter results, and optimistic about the outlook for this year and next. We see the evolving healthcare environment as an opportunity for growth, and we believe we\u2019re very well positioned to gain market share across the enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, let\u2019s go ahead and open it up for your questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A lot of good detail on the PBM side, so I thought maybe I\u2019d start off on the front end. Same-store sales down again this quarter, and I know you\u2019re citing softer traffic. I was wondering if you could just maybe share some color on whether you think this has been more macro-driven, or is there some competitive changes going on that are driving a little softness on the front end?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have discussed in the past that we continue to see a cautious consumer. We did see some pullback in consumer spending that began in the spring timeframe. It\u2019s manifesting itself in fewer trips. At the same time, we have seen the promotional environment intensify in both the drug and mass channels. At the same time, we have not made dramatic changes in our promotional strategy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a matter of fact, if you look at our year over year promotional circular page count, in the third quarter it was actually down 12%. And we continue to use ExtraCare as our point of differentiation along with delivering a way to create value for consumers. And we have been able to drive the basket size of our customers. And as Dave mentioned in his remarks, it\u2019s also important to point out that through these efforts we\u2019ve been able to achieve margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think on the front store sales issue, it\u2019s always a bit of art and science, trial and error. Mark and his retail team are certainly focused on it. We would like our front store comps to be better, but we\u2019ll be very disciplined about not chasing empty sales. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That makes a lot of sense. And Larry, I know you talked about a lot of the major topics in the sector, specifically the exchanges. And obviously look forward to getting more detail on that at the analyst day, but one of the other major topics as of late has been agreements across the supply chain as far as consolidating generic purchasing. I\u2019m just wondering if you could weigh in given some of the activity as of late, as far as your view of your current positioning in generic sourcing and whether or not you think in light of some of these moves that you would be interested in trying to garner more scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our position has really not changed since we discussed this on our last call. A generic sourcing alliance could present an interesting opportunity. We\u2019re certainly always open to learning and evaluating opportunities in the marketplace, and if we were to determine that an alliance could drive higher returns for us, we\u2019d certainly consider that. And we believe that we could do that without expending significant capital. So we\u2019ll continue to watch it, and there may be some incremental opportunities domestically, but we still see the global sourcing environment less clear, but again we\u2019ll be open to opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Bob Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In light of how fast the CVS share of the Caremark accounts has grown over the past few years, does it make sense to offer any type of quarterly update where you think your share stands and to offer any targets where that could go over the next couple of years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good question. As you know, we have seen substantial growth in share within CVS, within the Caremark book. I think over the past few years we\u2019ve moved from roughly 18% to in excess of 31% at this point in time. My guess is those are longer term movement trends. So probably quarter by quarter it might not make the most sense. Probably year over year is probably a more comparable perspective. So you\u2019ll probably see a little bit of that as we cycle into analyst day coming up here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a great question. I think it does make sense to look at it on an annual basis. And to Dave\u2019s point, keep in mind that that retail percent of the Caremark book of business, while it\u2019s grown, the pie has also grown at the same time. There have been north of $25 billion worth of new business wins during that period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robert Willoughby - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Any three year target per chance?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you give us any color on the share in the retail business now that is transitioning from 30- to 90-day? Where you think that might go, and how you are running the business or managing capacity in the stores differently as that has taken place?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have seen it grow for some time now. Acknowledging growth off of a smaller base, but it has been growing north of 20%. And I think that there are a lot of variables in play that are driving that growth. I\u2019ll start with Maintenance Choice, but there are also more plan designs out there that have 90-day options at retail, and there\u2019s been a lot of information out there that 90-day prescriptions also improve medication adherence. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think that that we\u2019ll continue to see a disproportionate growth and an acceleration from 30 to 90. Obviously, on the retail side, we have always done an effective job of managing SG&amp;A at the store level. And the labor models that we have built, along with our workflow in the pharmacy, enable us to flex our labor according to those volumes. And there are some labor efficiencies to be picked up there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly, you talked about restricted or preferred networks. Just curious what you\u2019re seeing take place, and what you\u2019re facilitating through Caremark, and what you\u2019re seeing take place in the market in terms of the appetite and adoption and utilization of preferred or narrowed networks on the retail front as we move into 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve clearly seen the growth of preferred networks in Medicare. Got off to a slow start when Medicare was first implemented, but you\u2019ve seen a lot of movement, particularly over the last couple of years. In Medicaid, we\u2019re seeing restricted networks in the managed Medicaid space. We think that continues to be something that this segment will be interested in. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in the employer space, you\u2019ve seen - and Dave talked about our growth of Maintenance Choice, which is a form of a narrow network - interest from employers. I would say this year probably less interest, because employers were more focused on healthcare reform changes they needed to make within their own book of business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it\u2019s interesting that health plans that historically have not been interested in narrow networks, we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest, particularly around their exchange offerings. So we\u2019ve had several health plans adopt narrow networks for their public exchange offerings. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we think it continues to be an opportunity for plans and clients to save money through either preferred or restricted networks. So we continue to see good growth opportunities in this area. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, on Maintenance Choice, any comment on the relative growth rates of 2.0 and 1.0? And how much time do you think it takes for 2.0 to start then customers migrating from 2.0 to 1.0? Will that be one full contract cycle? Or shorter? Longer? What are your thoughts on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll touch on this more at analyst day, but we have seen some adoption on 2.0. I think certainly, as we\u2019ve talked, we see an opportunity to, when you look at 1.0 and 2.0, the opportunity to cover more than 30 million lives over time, I think we see an adoption track where a client gets into 2.0 and then ultimately migrates in to 1.0 to maximize the savings. But we\u2019ll hit more of the metrics in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly, thinking about the front end and My Weekly ad, if you could segment traffic by loyalty of customer - I don\u2019t know if you would do a decile or a quartile or whatever - is traffic down among the most loyal customers? Or is it down more among the least loyal, so maybe some of that is by your design? And then over time, as My Weekly ad gets greater adoption, what does that do to traffic and is that a significant incremental positive to margin, as you\u2019re maybe wasting less promotional dollars?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Those are two great questions. If you look at our traffic through segmentation, we would see more of the declines among our least loyal customers. We continue to see growth in our most loyal customers. I think directionally, you\u2019re spot on in terms of the reality of as we migrate over time, and reduce our dependency on the weekly circular, there is certainly an opportunity to deliver value to our ExtraCare members and create a high level of satisfaction and a bigger share of wallet, and to be able to do that so there\u2019s a flowthrough to the P&amp;L. <strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by the way, the My Weekly circular just becomes one more tool. That\u2019s not going to be the single conduit that drives that behavior. It will be that in addition to many of the other attributes that ExtraCare offers the consumer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, when you did ExtraCare, that helped growth, right? Will My Weekly ad help to the same degree, or not as much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s early. We\u2019re experimenting with it now. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be able to talk about over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please proceed. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d like to just go back a little bit to the discussion about the private exchanges, and you talk about some being carve-in of pharmacy benefit and some being carve-out. Do you have any sense of kind of what percentage is going to be carve-in and what is going to be carve-out? And then also, related to that, is there a difference in profitability when it\u2019s carve-out versus carve-in?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll take the first part of that. Acknowledging that A) it\u2019s early, B) it\u2019s a small sample size. But you know, what we have seen is a trend that really looks at the historical preference of the clients. And by that I mean if the employer had pharmacy as a carve-out option, then they\u2019re going onto a private exchange product that continues to carve out pharmacy, and vice versa. If they have pharmacy carved in with their health plan, then they\u2019re migrating to a carve-in product. And again, it\u2019s a limited sample, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the profitability, it\u2019s really a function of what programs they adopt that really drives profitability. So it lowers their cost, but drives our profitability. Programs like mail formulary, network programs, and others. And we think with the consumer making that choice, they\u2019re going to be more likely to make those selections for themselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. And then switching gears, a question back to the discussion of the front end, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to eliminate the circular, the one that isn\u2019t tied to the loyalty card or the individual, but can you conceive of it being much less promotional and more kind of like an EDLP circular? I mean, there are other retailers who highlight their good deals every day, but not necessarily being focused on promotional items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that you are right. I don\u2019t think any of us see the circular going completely away. And I think that it will evolve over the next few years. I can see it being smaller. I can see it being more focused. Exactly what shape and form that takes, I think, is probably still an open question. I mean, we know that just because of the viewership or the readership of the newspaper, circular distribution is down from what it was five years ago. And so I think directionally you\u2019re correct with your hypothesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lisa Gill - JPMorgan </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Larry, thank you very much for all the comments on the public and private exchanges, but I\u2019m actually going to ask a question around Medicare Part D. When you look at your now guidance of roughly 3 million members versus 3.3 million before, is that roughly in line with the 350,000 that you talked about last time? And secondly, anything you\u2019re seeing in the open enrollment period that would change any of your thoughts around that going into next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In response to your first question, it is consistent with what we talked about on our last call in terms of the attrition of about 350,000 lives. And it\u2019s early in open enrollment, but we have not seen anything that is contradictory to what we\u2019ve talked about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lisa Gill - JPMorgan </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly, can you maybe just give us an update on where you are on RDS and conversion from RDS? Clearly the tax benefit goes away in 2014. And based on the sanctions that you have, can you just remind us if there\u2019s any impact at all of moving people potentially to an EGWP or any other programs as they shift away from RDS? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw most employers focused on healthcare reform this year, so most of the movement to EGWPs happened the year before. We think there will be a pickup in activity this year. Our plan would be out of sanction, so we believe that we\u2019ll be able to implement anyone that wants to move into an EGWP product moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other thing I would mention is that we have been operating under a waiver from CMS to continue to enroll EGWP members that we had commitments to prior to the sanction. So that has been ongoing. That waiver has been extended through January of \u201914.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had a quick housekeeping item, and then I wanted to get to my questions. Flu shots, is that in your script number or not? I can\u2019t remember.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Flu shots we do treat as a prescription. And I\u2019ll call it season to date\u2026 The season kicks off in the August timeframe, and what I\u2019m going to share with you probably goes through near the end of October. But we\u2019ve administered just over 3 million flu shots across our retail business and MinuteClinic. And that\u2019s up from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second question I have really goes to the outlook for the PBM. You guys talked about market share and that you feel like you can kind of, with the new environment, gain market share. It seems to me, as we look at Medicaid, I think you\u2019re 31% of that bus. It\u2019s grown quite a bit, so I want to understand can that go higher? Also, you commented that you\u2019re in 25 states with the exchanges. Can you get to more states? Can 70% become 90%? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the final question about next year as we have some big contracts out, like Tricare, what\u2019s your confidence that you\u2019ll continue to gain share on the PBM side of the business in those three different buckets? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of Medicaid, and I think specifically you\u2019re talking about the managed Medicaid environment. And you\u2019re right, we have about 30% share of the managed Medicaid market. We certainly see more room for growth there. We\u2019re estimating that the managed Medicaid market is going to grow by about 40% between now and 2016. So we see that, again, as a driver for growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as we\u2019re in 25 states with 70%, as we continue to win in the marketplace and win health plans, which we had some wins this year, we\u2019ll continue to expand our footprint. And just as far as winning across all segments, as Larry mentioned earlier, for the 2014 selling season we got over $5 billion in gross wins with 96% retention. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look back over the last several years, we\u2019ve continued to be very successful selling. Our integrated model continues to resonate in the marketplace with Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor, our integrated specialty capabilities we\u2019re launching, what we\u2019re able to do for our clients with MinuteClinic. So we\u2019re very bullish on our growth opportunities moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then one final follow up is if you continue to gain share like you have been, which is driving a tremendous amount of traffic into your assets, particularly your retail assets, and I know you\u2019re doing the promotional stuff, but Larry we\u2019ve talked about how do you get the incremental sales in a profitable way? It seems like there\u2019s a tremendous untapped opportunity to take that traffic and convert it to some front end sales. Any other color on how we get that done?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all, I agree with you, and as I mentioned earlier, I think it was the first question, that our retail team is working hard to improve our comp sales performance. And I think some of what you\u2019re describing lies in innovation and trial and error, and we\u2019ve got a talented team focused on it, and we\u2019ll continue to work and ultimately crack the code on that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wanted to ask a little bit about the specialty pharma environment. And I know you have a pilot going there to kind of join the CVS brick and mortar stores with the mail operations on specialty. If you could give us an update on what\u2019s going on there and how you think that will evolve as the specialty trends continue to grow. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you think of specialty today, and you think about it from an access to a member perspective, it\u2019s primarily a mail channel today. What we\u2019ve been able to do is take all of our specialty capabilities and connect them to our retail stores. So now members that want to get access to specialty medications can go in any one of our 7,400 stores as we roll this program out next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll leverage all of the back-end clinical capabilities, the billing capabilities, the fulfillment capabilities, and then we\u2019ll be able to deliver that prescription either to the member\u2019s home, like happens today with specialty pharmacy, or deliver it to their local CVS Pharmacy. And it\u2019s interesting, very similar to Maintenance Choice, half the people want to pick up their specialty prescription in their CVS local store, the other half want it mailed to their home. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you think about it from a pharma perspective, historically adherence levels for specialty medications have been lower in the retail channel than in the specialty channel. In our pilots, we\u2019ve been able to achieve the same levels of adherence through the integrated specialty offering that we have in mail. So we think pharma\u2019s going to be pretty bullish on this capability. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re improving access, we\u2019re achieving very high adherence levels, and we\u2019re delivering all the clinical capabilities that these patients need, with the convenience that we\u2019re able to offer through an integrated offering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And is the bigger win capturing more prescriptions at the local pharmacy, or is it just the convenience of delivery for the consumer?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think about it in probably two parts. One is we think because we\u2019ll have a differentiated offering, again it adds to our value proposition as we\u2019re out trying to win new clients. Secondly, there is a segment of the population that is open. Medicare is an example, where the patient has choice where they get their specialty prescription filled. So we think we have a better value proposition for those patients, so we think we will capture more share of that open business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think the only other point that I would make is that we can make it a seamless experience across all of the stakeholders that are involved here, to include the physician. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ross Muken - ISI Group </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe first just going back to all the stuff you laid out re reform. Do you feel like the more you continue to dig into this, and obviously there\u2019s a lot of things changing and a lot of unknowns, but do you feel like the integrated model, you continue to figure out sort of new services, new offerings, new potential profit drivers as things change, and you really sort of have a structural advantage there, having the full suite of capabilities versus maybe some of your peers?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think you said it very well. I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a whole lot I would add to that, other than agreeing with you. And I think it gets back to what we\u2019ve talked about many, many times, that if you think about, from the PBM perspective, that it\u2019s largely been a B2B bus, and if you think about the new world order adding B2C segment, we\u2019ve got expertise in both. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think that that\u2019s how we\u2019re uniquely positioned to gain share, acknowledging that we are going to go through a period of churn in terms of who\u2019s sponsoring the coverage. But we feel that we\u2019re well-positioned and that whether you\u2019re talking about our PBM assets, our retail assets, our MinuteClinic assets, that we can do things and bring differentiation into the market that would be difficult for standalone peers to replicate. <strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ross Muken - ISI Group </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess you guys have done a good job of educating us. Maybe just quickly on the selling season, if you look at some of the net losses, could you maybe just sort of tick through how much of that was sort of acquisition and if not, in terms of the update from Q2, what were the key reasons where you saw maybe the business move away from you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The numbers that we gave, to include the retention, does reflect the net impact of acquisition activity. And recognizing that we pick up some from acquisitions and we lose some. But acquisition activity posed a headwind for us in terms of the impact of that. And I\u2019ll let Jon talk about it from a client perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a very sticky business. We\u2019ve got retention at 96%, you add on top of that the $5 billion in new wins. You\u2019re always going to see some movement as people go out and evaluate the market, but we\u2019ve been very happy with our ability to retain customers. And with that 96% retention, including some of the acquisitions that are moving away from us, like Amerigroup. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take two more questions please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Zach [Sacheck] - Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning. This is Zach [Sacheck] for Ricky. Just had a question on your Medicare Part D preferred network. We\u2019ve seen a proliferation in the number of Part D networks. I was wondering if you could talk about your offering for 2014 and how it compares to some of your competitors in the preferred network area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jonathan Roberts </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have a preferred network. It\u2019s very similar to what we had this year. It\u2019s about 25,000 pharmacies where they\u2019ll get advantages. The member will have a lower copay if they go to a preferred pharmacy. And then we wrap the balance of the network around that so that we have the full suite of 65,000 pharmacies participating in it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it\u2019s been very successful, and we\u2019ve created enough copay differential to drive pretty good share into those preferred pharmacies, so we\u2019re very happy with the performance of that preferred network. And it\u2019s allowed us to offer a very competitive product in the marketplace that will help us continue to grow as we move forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also keep in mind, if we use Aetna as the example, that we have an Aetna preferred Med D product out in the marketplace that we\u2019re supporting them on as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Zach [Sacheck] - Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just a quick question on Minute Clinic. Of the 18% revenue growth you talked about, I was wondering if you would be willing to break down how much of that was organic versus new store growth? And then if you could talk at all about how the payer mix might have evolved over the course of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t know them off the top of my head, but we\u2019ve been comping, if you look at it from a comp perspective, in the teens to low 20s most recently in MinuteClinic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your second question, in terms of payer mix, we have continued to see a high rate of adoption from health plans and even government sponsored programs. And if you look at MinuteClinic visits now that have some type of insurance copay tied to it, if you will, that number is now in the mid-80s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our last question comes from the line of David Magee from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Magee - SunTrust</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question, just on the specialty pharma, you called out inflation as being a factor, and I was curious if you could quantify that and specify whether that\u2019s sort of in line with the trend or are we seeing sort of a sustainable trend change there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Especially inflation\u2019s been pretty consistent over the last several years, so it\u2019s generally 8% to 10%. You have to add on top of that mix, though, as new drugs come to the market they\u2019re fairly expensive, and then utilization is the third component. So that translates into trend or cost increases that our clients are seeing that are in the high teens, low 20s, and clearly managing this area has become our clients\u2019 top priority. And we\u2019ll talk more about what we\u2019re doing in this area on analyst day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Magee - SunTrust </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do you have market share numbers on that bus year over year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have that with me. We\u2019ll probably touch a little bit on that at analyst day as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Magee - SunTrust </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My last question has to do with the promotional environment that you anticipate on the front end. Have you sort of baked in a significantly more promotional environment this year relative to last year as it relates to the holidays? Or how do you view that at this time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Denton </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Larry indicated before, we have seen the promotional environment increase over the last several months. I would say that while that has occurred in the marketplace, we have been pretty diligent in our approach to this. We have not really changed our promotional posture much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d say we continue to use our loyalty card program to drive performance for us and to make sure that there\u2019s a good balance between what\u2019s happening from a front store sales perspective, but also quite frankly what\u2019s happening from a margin perspective. And we\u2019ve been consistently kind of growing our front store margin rate. And again, there\u2019s a balance there that we\u2019ll watch closely. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Merlo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me just thank everybody for joining us this morning, along with your interest in CVS Caremark. And we will look forward to seeing many of you next month at our analyst day in New York. </p>", "twitContent": "$CVS - CVS Caremark's CEO Discusses Q3 2013 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/1806012-cvs-caremarks-ceo-discusses-q3-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "1212", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17896", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17952", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/1806012-cvs-caremarks-ceo-discusses-q3-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/1806012-cvs-caremarks-ceo-discusses-q3-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
