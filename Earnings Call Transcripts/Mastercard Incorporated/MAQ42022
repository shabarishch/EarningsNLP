Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s get right into it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, starting with the big picture. Consumer spending has remained resilient, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. We closed out the year with strong financial results and several notable wins. Quarter four net revenues were up 17% and adjusted operating income up 19%, both versus a year ago, as always, on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we are keeping a close eye on a variety of positive and negative factors. The broadly resilient labor market with low unemployment and rising wages, coupled with elevated consumer savings levels, are key drivers of consumer spending. We\u2019re also tracking efforts by the central banks to curb inflation, along with moderating energy prices and the reopening of China. So, still lots of moving pieces.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From an overall consumer spending standpoint, we expect the consumer to be relatively resilient. Spending patterns have largely normalized relative to the effects of the pandemic with the notable exception of China. In terms of switched volumes, domestic volumes in the fourth quarter remained steady relative to 2019 levels with some slight moderation in the U.S. related to lower gas prices recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cross-border travel continued to recover in quarter four with inbound travel either flat or up in every region sequentially relative to 2019 levels. As of the first three weeks of January, inbound cross-border travel to all regions is now above 2019 levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will continue to monitor the economic environment closely, and should the outlook change, we\u2019re prepared to move quickly to adjust our spending levels as we have done in the past. In the meantime, we continue to focus on the things we can control. This starts with our three strategic priorities: expanding in payments; extending our services; and embracing new networks. And here are some examples of how we\u2019re progressing against each of these.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Starting with payments. We won substantial new business this quarter. Our innovative products, differentiated services and partnership approach enabled us to secure major portfolio flips, extend relationships and launch new programs with banks, co-brand partners and transit systems around the world. I am very excited about our expanded partnership with Citizens to become their exclusive payments provider across all product portfolios in the United States. We will shift their debit portfolio to Mastercard, and we will maintain exclusivity on credit and commercial. Citizens selected Mastercard based on our digital assets, open banking capabilities and safety and security tools.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have also extended and enhanced our long-term partnership with Citi. It solidifies Mastercard as Citi\u2019s exclusive global partner for Citi-branded consumer credit, debit and small business cards. We look forward to continuing to partner to deliver digital initiatives, new technologies and innovative payment solutions together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve extended our longstanding relationship with Bank of America across their consumer and small business debit and credit lines of business. They\u2019re great partners. We\u2019re especially proud to continue as the lead brand for all newly issued small business cards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our positive momentum with Chase continued this quarter as well. Building up on our recent co-brand, commercial and Pay-by-Bank partnership announcements, we are excited to announce that we have renewed the Chase Freedom Flex portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the UK, we recently extended our credit deal with NatWest Group for consumer and commercial. We\u2019re partnering with Belbim, [ph] Istanbul transportation to convert over 17 million closed-loop cards, Mastercards and add 24,000 new acceptance locations across the city. We\u2019ve partnered with QNB Finansbank and Trendyol, a large e-commerce marketplace in Turkey, over 30 million customers to launch a new Mastercard co-brand credit product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, an important driver of our success in core payments is our ability to deliver innovation and thought leadership. We are designing and deploying innovation solutions at scale, as a result, are the clear partner of choice for our customers. Three recent examples include our work in Installments, Tokenization and Click to Pay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Starting off with installments. SoFi launched Pay in 4, becoming the first bank in the U.S. to launch within the Mastercard Installments program. SoFi valued the broad acceptance, strong consumer protections and commission-based open banking capabilities that all make Mastercard Installments unique. We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline for Mastercard Installments and plan to add several additional programs across multiple regions throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Tokenization. We surpassed 2 billion tokenized transactions per month and for the year, we are up 38%. We\u2019re currently enabling digital transactions in over 110 countries. Tokenization helps keep the ecosystem safe and secure across a wide range of use cases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One example that I think is particularly cool is the work we are doing with in-car payments. We\u2019re working with car manufacturers and fintechs to integrate payments using our tokenization platform and biometric authentication capabilities. Think about the simplicity it brings to paying for gas, tolls, charging or entertainment right from your car. This is a great example of Mastercard working with partners to drive the convergence of the Internet of Things, 5G and addressing consumer demand for cool digital experiences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It also highlights how we\u2019re expanding the reach and the value of our acceptance network through new channels to support new use cases. This is just the beginning. Watch for more to come in the space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on Click to Pay, we partnered with Adyen to launch Click to Pay on their global payment platform, recognizing the value that it brings to guest checkouts and millions of online shoppers. Adyen joins more than 20 other payment service providers around the world, bringing Click to Pay to thousands of merchants globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now this focus on innovation and partnership is also a critical part of our strategy to penetrate the prioritized set of new flows that we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day. We continue to make solid progress. Here are some of examples how we\u2019re driving growth in each area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, disbursements and remittances. Mastercard Send and our cross-border services capabilities are solving for an expanding set of use cases across multiple geographies. For example, we partnered with social marketplace platform, Poshmark, to enable seller payouts. And for cross-border payments, we\u2019ve teamed up with Paysend to broaden our global reach and expand the ability to send international payments across card brands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, we\u2019re deploying digital capabilities to displace cash and check-based commercial payments at the point of sale, huge opportunity. In France, we signed an agreement with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to develop their corporate card book. And in South Korea, we partnered with KakaoBank and Samsung Card to launch new debit and credit co-brand offerings for small businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The third flow is B2B accounts payable payments. Our virtual card capabilities provide an effective digital solution to address the working capital, process efficiency and data challenges that are prevalent in B2B. We are a global leader in virtual card. We\u2019re seeing rapid growth in this space. We\u2019re bolstering our position through new partnerships and capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, we announced plans to partner with Sabre and confirm our pay to accelerate the use of virtual cards for B2B travel payments. We also signed an agreement with fintech partner, Extenet, to offer virtual mobile corporate cards in the U.S. and Canada.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, on the consumer bill payment front, we are focused on deploying market-specific solutions to meet unique needs of consumers and businesses. For example, in Norway, we are powering the eFaktura service, which is used by the vast majority of citizens to pay their bills. In 2022, we hit a milestone as over 200 million digital invoices were sent using eFaktura.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see, we\u2019re making significant progress expanding in payments, and we are excited about the opportunity in front of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the second of our three strategic priorities, services. Services provide differentiation and diversification for Mastercard. Our strategy is to leverage our services to drive growth at the core and to expand into new segments and use cases. We\u2019re making steady progress on both and have significant opportunity for future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our services continue to drive growth in the core as evidenced by our wins and extensions with Citizens, Citi, NatWest and others, as I mentioned earlier. One example of a service that enhances the value of payments is Consumer Clarity. The service provides cardholders with merchant details in digital receipts to reduce disputes, low charge-back costs and improve the consumer experience. We recently partnered with TSYS who will offer Consumer Clarity to over 25 million cardholders in the U.S. and the UK.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In 2022, we signed up over 50 financial institutions and merchant partners for Consumer Clarity, including large issuers like Ita\u00fa in Brazil. We\u2019re also expanding our services to new segments and new use cases, including governments, retailers, digital partners and financial institutions. This quarter, we partnered with research and consulting firms, including EFO and SEMA [ph] in Germany, as well as the Barbados Ministry of Tourism and International Transport to provide governments with detailed insights into tourism and retail spending trends. We engage with retailers like Lowe\u2019s who are leveraging our Test &amp; Learn capabilities to conduct analytics on their core business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We partner with large fintechs like Monzo in the UK. to advise on product development strategies. And we are deploying our personalization solutions, which we acquired through Dynamic Yield, across a range of retail and financial institutions, including Carrefour, Argentina, Height, [indiscernible] to enhance and scale their personalization efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m very encouraged by the continued momentum in our services growth strategy and the differentiation and diversification that these capabilities bring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now move on to our third strategic priority, which is embracing new networks, namely open banking and digital identity. This quarter, I\u2019d like to highlight an example of how our open banking capabilities have come together with our other strategic priorities to offer a new solution. As I mentioned earlier, in quarter four, JPMorgan Payments and Mastercard announced an innovative Pay-by-Bank solution. Solution utilizes the MasterCard open banking platform to modernize existing ACH payments and allow customers to pay bills from their bank account in a frictionless manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pay-by-Bank offers choice and provides a simple and secure experience of billers and merchants as well as consumers by enhancing existing ACH transactions. This deal is a manifestation of our multi-rail strategy, expands our addressable market by our open banking capabilities, and it deepens our relationship with JPMorgan Chase. We\u2019re actively working with them to take the solution to market this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also continue to make our progress with open banking in Europe. Mastercard is connected to more than 3,000 banks and financial institutions across 18 markets to power their open banking efforts. This quarter, we partnered with Secure Trust Bank in the UK, who will leverage our open banking capabilities to provide safe and convenient ways for their customers to repay retail loans directly from their bank account.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, aided by a resilient consumer and the continued recovery in cross-border travel. In payments, we won substantial new business this quarter, including Citizens. We\u2019re expanding our differentiated services and embracing new networks, including leveraging our open banking capabilities to power solutions, like JPMorgan\u2019s Pay-by-Bank. With all that, we\u2019re well positioned for the opportunities ahead. We will manage the business with agility, should the macroeconomic outlook change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sachin, over to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sachin Mehra</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Michael. Turning now to page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net revenue was up 17%, supported by a resilient consumer spending and the continued recovery of cross-border travel relative to 2019 levels. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth. Operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt increase from acquisitions. Operating income was up 19%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. Net income was up 16%, which includes a 2 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. EPS was up 19% year-over-year to $2.65, which includes a $0.06 contribution from share repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion worth of stock and an additional $590 million through January 23, 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, let\u2019s turn to page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 8% year-over-year on a local currency basis. On the same basis, if you exclude Russia from the prior period, GDV [Technical Difficulty] by 14%. In the U.S., GDV increased by 7% with credit growth of 14%, reflecting in part the recovery of spending on travel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Debit increased 1%. Excluding the impact of the roll-off of a previously discussed customer agreement, debit increased approximately 5%. Outside of the U.S., volume increased 8% with credit growth of 9% and debit growth of 7%. Cross-border volume was up 31% globally for the quarter, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to page 5. Switched transactions grew 8% year-over-year in Q4. Excluding Russia from the prior year, switched transactions grew 18% year-over-year in Q4. Card-present and card-not-present growth rates remain strong. Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in all regions when excluding Russia. Contactless now represents 56% of all in-person switched purchase transactions. In addition, card growth was 5% or 9% if we exclude cards issued by Russian banks from the prior year card count. Globally, there are 3.1 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s turn to page 6 for highlights on the revenue line items, again, described on a currency-neutral basis, unless otherwise noted. The increase in net revenue of 17% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth as well as growth in services, partially offset by growth in rebates and incentives. Acquisitions contributed 1 ppt to this growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments were up 6%, while worldwide gross dollar volume grew 8%. The difference is primarily driven by mix. Cross-border volume fees increased 40%, while cross-border volumes increased 31%. The 9 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix as higher-yielding ex intra-Europe cross-border volumes grew faster than intra-Europe cross-border volumes this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Transaction processing fees were up 16%, while switched transactions grew 8%. The 8 ppt difference is primarily due to favorable mix, FX-related revenues and pricing. Other revenues were up 16%, including a 1 ppt contribution from acquisitions. The remaining growth was driven primarily by our cyber &amp; intelligence and data &amp; services solutions. Finally, rebates and incentives were up 18%, reflecting the strong growth in volumes and transactions and new and renewed deal activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to page 7. You can see that on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis, excluding special items, total adjusted operating expenses increased 13%, including a 3 ppt impact from acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the remaining increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs to support the continued execution of our strategic initiatives, partially offset by lower advertising and marketing costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to page 8. Let\u2019s discuss the operating metrics for the first three weeks of January compared to Q4 2022. Each of these metrics, with the exception of cross-border card-not-present excluding travel, were favorably impacted by the lapping of the slower growth that occurred in January 2022 related to the Omicron variant. Switched volumes grew 21% year-over-year, up 7 ppt versus Q4. Switched transactions grew 12% year-over-year, up 4 ppt versus Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, cross-border volumes grew 42% year-over-year, up 11 ppt versus Q4, driven by cross-border travel growth of 84% year-over-year, up 25 ppt versus Q4. Cross-border card-not-present excluding travel grew 10% year-over-year, up 2 ppt from Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of administrative notes, for your reference to help you understand the trends in the business, ex Russia, we have suspended -- where we suspended operations in March 2022, we have included an appendix later in this deck to show all the data points from this schedule, if you excluded activity from Russian-issued cards from prior periods. Additionally, as the impacts of the pandemic recede, going forward, we will no longer provide operating metric levels as a percentage of 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to page 9, I want to share our thoughts on the upcoming year. Let me start by saying that I believe that we are well positioned to address the significant growth opportunities at hand. We have established a clear set of strategic priorities and are making steady progress against each of them. This is evidenced by the many wins across the products and services Michael has discussed on this call and over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the macroeconomic front, as Michael laid out, we are monitoring a number of both, positive and negative factors. We do expect consumer spending to hold up relatively well in this environment, driven in part by the strong labor market. It is important to remember that we are coming off a year of strong growth as we lap the effects of the pandemic, and we expect our go-forward growth rates to moderate accordingly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a cross-border travel standpoint, most regions have recovered and are well above 2019 levels in Q4. The exception is Asia, where there is still room to improve with China reopening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a little further context here. China represented about 1% of inbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at approximately 20% of Q4 2019 levels. Similarly, China represented about 2% of outbound cross-border travel volumes pre-pandemic in 2019. In Q4, this volume was at about 50% of Q4 2019 levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With this in mind, our base case scenario for the full year 2023 is for net revenues to grow at the high end of a low-double-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. This growth rate would be higher by approximately 1.5 ppt if you exclude Russia-related revenues from 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Acquisitions are forecasted to have a minimal impact to this growth rate, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the year, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the euro relative to U.S. dollar. In terms of operating expenses, we will continue to carefully manage our expenses as we invest in our payments, services and new network priorities to drive short and long-term growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, we expect operating expenses to grow at the high end of a high-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 of a ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a 1 ppt headwind for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the first quarter. Year-over-year net revenue growth is expected to be at the low end of a low-double-digit rate, again, on a currency-neutral basis excluding acquisitions and special items and reflects generally resilient consumer spending. A couple of points to note. Q1 will be the last quarter in which we experience the lapping effect of our decision to suspend operations in Russia in Q1 of 2022. And we expect cross-border volume growth in Q1 2023 to be elevated as a result of the effects of Omicron in Q1 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Acquisitions are forecast to add about 0.5 a ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of 2 ppt for the quarter. From an operating expense standpoint, we expect Q1 operating expense growth to be at the low end of a high-single-digit rate versus a year-ago on a currency-neutral basis, excluding acquisitions and special items. Acquisitions are forecast to add about 2 ppt to this growth, while foreign exchange is expected to be a tailwind of approximately 1 ppt for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Other items to keep in mind. On the other income and expense line, we are at an expense run rate of approximately $100 million per quarter given the prevailing interest rates and debt levels. This excludes gains and losses on our equity investments, which are excluded from our non-GAAP metrics. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18% in Q1 and 18% to 18.5% for the year based on the current geographic mix of our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I will turn the call back over to Warren.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Warren Kneeshaw</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Sachin. Audra, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&amp;A session.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Harshita Rawat at Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harshita Rawat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Mike or Sachin, I wanted to ask about Pay-by-Bank. Over the years, you\u2019ve developed and acquired capabilities for Pay-by-Bank in different countries. You talked about this new partnership with JPMorgan. But a skeptic could also argue that Pay-by-Bank is a risk to cards longer term, and there\u2019s some precedence in countries. So, can you talk about the push and pull for severe? And also maybe touch upon where is Pay-by-Bank being used versus cards and how\u2019s Mastercard able to participate in those transactions? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. Harshita, let me start off on that. So, the way we think about this is in the end, it is about delivering choice to consumers, choice of merchants, choice to banks, and we are therefore in all relevant ways to pay. But it\u2019s also true that the card ecosystem over the years has driven tremendous value. So, it is a prevalent way to pay for many, many use cases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But on the side, we have alternative payment methods emerging. And we look at those as options to go after new use cases, and that\u2019s exactly what happened here in the context of our partnership with JPMorgan. This is focused on existing ACH payments, which are not bringing the value to the biller or the consumer that they are looking for. Frankly, though, very specifically, what we\u2019re doing here, the issue with some of these account-to-account payments is you never really know what balance is on the account. And our open banking capabilities are really providing a payment success factor here that tells the biller this is a good time to debit this particular account, so true value brought that somebody is willing to pay for, in this case, the biller/the merchant. So, a good example of where there can be value created an alternative payment tools while this doesn\u2019t take away from the power the cards are bringing to consumers and merchants. So, we see this as coexistence. Where this is going over time, we don\u2019t quite know, but our multi-rail strategy positions us well to play in either field.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll move next to Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Darrin Peller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nice job on the quarter and the year. When we look ahead, and we\u2019re looking at the trend you\u2019re showing us for January, even despite easier comps on Omicron, it does look like you have pretty conservative assumptions built into the guide for the year for top line growth of low double digits. Just given the trends we\u2019re seeing even beyond January, but ex Russia, you anniversary that after March, and the numbers go materially higher growth rates. So, can you just tell us if there\u2019s some building blocks like around what you\u2019re assuming on macro -- from today\u2019s macro activity going forward and maybe rebates incentives, is that a factor here? Thanks again, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Darrin. Good morning. So, let me provide you a little bit of color here. Look, I mean, what we\u2019ve generally assumed in our base assumptions that I mentioned when I was delivering my prepared remarks is resilient consumer spending through 2023. I mean, we see a resilient consumer today, and we\u2019re seeing a generally resilient consumer spending pattern going forward in our base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other thing which we\u2019ve contemplated, as we mentioned, from a cross-border standpoint, and particularly cross-border travel standpoint, the vast majority of the regions have now reached that state where they are kind of growing and growing at a healthy pace, but they\u2019re not growing at an accelerating pace. So, they\u2019ve reached that level of stability. So, let me give you a little bit of color here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ll remember as we are coming out of COVID, right, intra-Europe came back first cross-border standpoint. After that, we saw several inter markets come back from a cross-border standpoint, U.S., UK, Canada, Latin America, all of those. All of those are growing at a healthy pace, and we\u2019re assuming they\u2019ll continue to grow at a healthy pace but not at an accelerating pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The one area where we are assuming an increase in terms of growth is around Asia Pacific. I mean, Asia Pacific has been a lagger in terms of recovery of cross-border travel. And we\u2019re expecting that there will be -- with the borders recently opening in several markets in AP that there will be some level of recovery, which will come through there when you index back to 2019. So, that\u2019s kind of generally been the base case we\u2019ve kind of assumed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, I mean, to be perfectly honest with you, I think that the reality is we\u2019ve got things which are helping us from a share win standpoint. We\u2019ve got strong consumer spending, our services capabilities continuing to grow at a healthy pace, all of that is built into our guide as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also remember that in 2022, we did have elevated levels of FX volatility which were there in the market, which actually supported the growth rate which we had in 2022. It\u2019s hard to predict, but that looks like on a going-forward basis, we do our best assumptions on that from an FX volatility standpoint. But that\u2019s kind of the building blocks as to how we\u2019ve gone about building our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The last point I\u2019ll make is around rebates and incentives, you asked the question. As you can see, quarter-over-quarter, [ph] we talk about how we are delivering wins. We are winning with new customers. We are expanding our business with existing customers. So, we are building in assumptions from a rebates and incentive standpoint, which will be consistent with what you\u2019re seeing in our track record from a winning standpoint as it relates to us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Lisa Ellis at SVB MoffettNathanson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lisa Ellis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Michael, I wanted to follow up in your prepared remarks related to new flows. You highlighted that that B2B POS payments as a notable opportunity area and highlighted a few new SMB co-brand wins there. Can you just talk a little bit more holistically about this opportunity? Remind us, a, how big it is; and then b, what\u2019s different about it? What do you have to do differently as Mastercard to capture this opportunity relative to the consumer side? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right, Lisa. So, the opportunity here lies really in taking our existing set of tools, namely from the card ecosystem, very specifically the virtual card capability, which came through an acquisition many, many years ago that we\u2019ve now built out -- ourselves into the leader here. So this existing set of tools and a huge opportunity in terms of flows to be addressed and make them more efficient, we\u2019re looking at $14 trillion from an opportunity perspective. If you recall what we laid out across the 4 flows, new flows, this is the -- one of the large ones here that we quoted. And the way to go about this is really to say, all right, who are the different players that we already have in our ecosystem. We bring BCNs in too. There\u2019s a lot of deals with financial institutions, but there\u2019s also a lot of deals with partners out in the travel space, and the travel space is really the one that\u2019s been most promising for us, and that is coming back right now. So this is a near-term opportunity. Cash and checks dominated existing tools, existing partners. This is right for us to go after it, and we\u2019re leaning in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Lisa, maybe I can just add a little bit out here, particularly as you think about the virtual card opportunity, which Mike just talked about. The differentiation, which is provided by technology which is what Michael talked about by virtue of the acquisition, which we had with our virtual card capabilities, but there\u2019s also differentiation in terms of our approach from a go-to-market standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And specifically, when you target flows from a go-to-market standpoint, you go on a vertical-by-vertical basis. So, as you know, we\u2019ve been very successful in the travel vertical. Part of the reason we\u2019ve been successful in the travel vertical is having a deep understanding of what it takes at the travel integrator level to be able to embed your technology there so that you are the payment choice, which people will exercise when they have to make those payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similarly, as we look at that opportunity going forward, there are several other verticals we\u2019re making the similar kinds of advances in. So, that\u2019s specific as it relates to the BCN piece. But you also asked about small business and the commercial point-of-sale opportunity, which is there. And the reality is we\u2019ve been winning significant new deals in that small business opportunity. And we see, candidly, a very sizable market opportunity in commercial point of sale, a large part of that is still in cash and check. And the reality is, just like we did in B2M where we displace cash and check utilizing digital technologies and innovation, that\u2019s kind of the advances we\u2019re making also in commercial point of sale. So, that\u2019s how we kind of see and frame the opportunity set across both of these areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You can hear it. It helps you have a CFO that used to be the head of our Commercial Products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Tien-Tsin Huang at JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tien-Tsin Huang</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask just big picture, if you would characterize visibility here for us on revenue versus, I guess, you can go back to pandemic or pre-pandemic. Just curious on visibility given you mentioned lots of moving pieces. And then, same thing on expenses, you said in the prepared remarks here that you\u2019re prepared to adjust investments, if necessary. If the base case and the outlook here is to show some operating leverage, can we assume the same operating leverage if revenue weakens relative to expectations? Sorry for the long question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Tien-Tsin. So, on your question around revenue, it\u2019s like I laid out, right? I mean, at the end of the day, we put our base case together. We\u2019ve kind of laid out what our assumptions are from a base case standpoint. And at the end of the day, we don\u2019t have the crystal ball to actually suggest that that is the way things are going to play out. But based on everything we\u2019re seeing in the nature of current trends as well as leading indicators, particularly as it relates to the overall strength of the labor market, we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing from a base case standpoint as it relates to the outlook for revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to one component of revenues, which we oftentimes think about is around -- on an as-reported basis versus what it is on a currency-neutral basis, very hard to predict where foreign exchange markets go. But again, we\u2019ve seen recent strengthening of the euro take place, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve kind of shared with you in terms of our assumptions from an FX standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, you asked about operating leverage. Look, I mean, the reality is we\u2019ve always operated with the philosophy of delivering positive operating leverage over the long term. We look at the top line. We look at how our expense is up also against that top line. We have, in the past, demonstrated our capability to modulate our expenses to the extent we start to see adverse impacts take place on the top line and vice versa. And the reality is what we don\u2019t want to do is impact the long-term growth potential of our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we will continue to invest in our business with our eye on the long term. We will be prudent about not going into spaces from an OpEx standpoint, which are not in demand. Obviously, I\u2019m kind of stating the obvious here. But the reality is the philosophy remains unchanged. We will look to deliver positive operating leverage as a company. And we have the tools and the ability to actually modulate expenses if top line -- if we feel like the top line growth is going to get impacted over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Sanjay Sakhrani at KBW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sanjay Sakhrani</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First off, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re getting rid of the relative to 2019 metric, for good reason. Just a question on cross-border and sort of the operating assumption this year. I know there\u2019s a number of different trends that you guys talked about. But there\u2019s still a decent amount of pent-up demand. I guess, how do you think cross-border travel behaves in a backdrop where macro might get worse from here? Maybe you could use some historical precedent here. Maybe just give us sort of how you\u2019re thinking about it. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So Sanjay, let me share a few thoughts on how we think about cross-border, right? So at the end of the day, there are numerous things which impact how people travel and spend in the cross-border environment. But at the outset, what I want to say is that the fundamentals around the cross-border proposition as delivered by Mastercard actually stand to be very sound just like they were in the pre-pandemic days. We said this through the pandemic, and it\u2019s played out in that manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me get a little bit more specific as it relates to pent-up demand -- your question around pent-up demand. The reality is we all know from what we hear on the earnings calls of airlines that capacity is constrained from an airline standpoint. And with that constrained capacity and elevated prices, you\u2019re seeing that impact come through when you do P times Q, which is price multiplied by quantity, you get kind of what the resultant impact from a spend standpoint is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fast forward, as capacity comes back online, one would expect that people will -- there will be some level of adjustment in prices because the demand-supply equation gets a little bit more in equilibrium. And so overall, we\u2019re not assuming that that necessarily results in a tailwind because capacity comes back online, right, because there\u2019s going to be an adjustment which takes place from a price standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our view -- again, we hope we\u2019re wrong, and we hope cross-border spending kind of goes with more capacity, prices remain elevated and people continue to spend, but we\u2019ve got to take a point of view on that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re taking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other point I\u2019ll make is, as it relates to what the impact of FX rates is on cross-border and cross-border travel. The reality is what we\u2019ve seen historically is that when exchange rates move, for example, with the dollar strengthening, with the lag effect, you would tend to see inbound into the U.S. get impacted. That\u2019s only natural. It gets more expensive for people coming from different parts of the globe to come into the U.S. But what we\u2019ve also seen is individual extend to then redirect that cross-border spend to other parts of the globe where they don\u2019t feel the impact of that come through. So, movements in foreign exchange rates, does have an impact on how we think about cross-border going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just to add one point here, Sanjay, that is over the last two years, we\u2019ve been winning portfolios in the space. We\u2019ve really focused on the space, expecting to come back. If you recall, let me just remind everybody here, across airlines, across travel, our online travel agencies, across lodging, across other forms of transports like trains, Myriad, Virgin Atlantic, Amtrak, JetBlue, Cathay Pacific, British Airways and so forth, we have won portfolios. And we\u2019ve bolstered that in terms of market access through these partners with additional products. So there\u2019s Mastercard Travel Rewards out there, which is now in 80 countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we believe into the macroeconomic environment that Sachin just laid out, we have the better proposition. So, it remains an exciting space. The pace in which we\u2019ll grow, we\u2019ll have to see that is characterized by what Sachin just said, but we certainly have a differentiated proposition in that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one last comment I want to make, Sanjay, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re excited about metrics and how we\u2019re changing the metrics. From a metrics perspective, I want to complete -- back to Lisa\u2019s question earlier. I mentioned the $14 trillion on commercial POS, but there\u2019s also $24 trillion on accounts payable, which makes the total opportunity in this combined space, $38 trillion. So, that conversation earlier was an important one on a very big part of our priorities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Jason Kupferberg at Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I really appreciate the China cross-border data you gave there for both inbound and outbound. I think you said that inbound is running at about 20% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter and outbound at about 50% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of how much improvement you\u2019re expecting in those metrics in 2023 as the reopening progresses? And then separately, can you just make any high-level comments on growth for each of your three strategic pillars in \u201823? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So first, Jason, I\u2019m not going to share specifics as it relates to how we built our model up for the full year. What I will share with you is as it relates to the recovery of both inbound and outbound for China, we have built in some level of recovery as the year progresses. It\u2019s our best estimate as to what we expect to happen by virtue of the borders opening and the quantity and requirements being lifted. But suffice it to say that the opportunity is pretty sizable. The fact that we were in Q4 at 20% of 2019 levels from an inbound travel standpoint, cross-border travel standpoint is just suggestive of the fact that if you just think about what\u2019s gone on around the regions and how they\u2019ve recovered and bounced right back and gone well above 2019 levels, there\u2019s a significant opportunity both on inbound and outbound as it relates to China. And sorry, the second part of your question, Jason?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just the three strategic pillars, what you\u2019re modeling for revenue growth on those in \u201823?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, I mean, when you -- the strategic priorities, we\u2019ve got payment services in new networks, as Michael has talked about. Look, I mean, I\u2019ll give you a general sense. I mean, you know about -- from a payment standpoint, we\u2019ve been doing this, and we\u2019ve been doing this for many decades, and that is the substantive part of how we deliver our revenue growth. Over the last decade, we\u2019ve shown you how services have grown and still growing at a healthy pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In my view, the demand for our services capability still remains very strong. You\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been growing at a faster pace in services relative to the overall growth of our business. And I don\u2019t think we should assume anything different on a going-forward basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And new networks is relatively nascent really. So again, I would put that into the space of it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s growing off a small base at a very healthy clip. But the reality is on the overall Mastercard, it\u2019s still to have a meaningful impact. So, that\u2019s kind of the best I can share with you on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jason, I\u2019d say the model really is one not of separate pillars. This is an integrated business proposition where services differentiates payments. And payments is oftentimes a way to build out a further -- a broader set of services and so forth. So, it kind of goes in the circle -- a virtuous circle, I have to say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you look at it, the -- historically, we gave you a number a couple of years ago that service is a third of our quarter. It has been growing faster. I gave you an example earlier in my prepared remarks on Consumer Clarity, which is something that is transaction-related, and it\u2019s growing faster with 50 new issuers. So, there\u2019s just a lot of momentum in there. But, there is also the kind of services that are not related to the underlying payments business. For example, what the example I gave you on Test &amp; Learn, where we\u2019re working with a set of customers to work on their base core business as in Lowe\u2019s, the example that I gave you. So, different sets of dynamics, but they go hand in hand, and that is the power of the differentiated and diversified business model that we have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll move next to Rayna Kumar at UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Warren Kneeshaw</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Rayna, are you on mute? Operator, let\u2019s go to the next, and try to get Rayna back on line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to Will Nance at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Will Nance</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe I\u2019ll squeeze one last 2019 -- versus 2019 question before the metrics go away. When we -- some of the kind of moving pieces in December, it seems like across some of the metrics, things seem to take a little bit of a step down on the 2019 stack. So, just any color on what you\u2019re seeing on a regional basis between kind of e-commerce and travel and how those trends have kind of continued into January, maybe excluding some of the impacts of China that you\u2019re seeing? And then just a more numerical piece of that question as I -- appreciate the color you gave on the China metrics on inbound and outbound travel. Just wondering if you have any color on just the overall contribution of China to cross-border volumes?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, Will. So, I\u2019ll take your questions in order out here. You talked about some color around how we\u2019re seeing things shape up in Q4 relative to 2019 levels. We\u2019re seeing pretty stable levels as it relates to switched volumes, switched transactions in cross-border, in fact, marginally up on each one of them quarter-over-quarter. So for example, in switched volumes in Q3 as a percentage of 2019, we were running at 154%; in Q4, we were running at 156%. And you can see this in the slide deck, which we shared with you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The one thing to just keep in mind is in the U.S. in Q4, we have seen a little bit of an impact come through from lower gas prices, and that\u2019s kind of being reflected in the numbers you see right here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You asked a question from a regional color standpoint. I\u2019d say there\u2019s remarkably consistent growth that we\u2019re seeing in most regions. For example, in Europe, Europe continues hold up pretty well. Latin America and EMEA are also actually holding up pretty well from a growth standpoint. In Q4, China was in the negative, particularly in its domestic volumes. And again, remember, our -- we don\u2019t generate a lot of revenue from the domestic side. But, it was impacted negatively because of the flareup in the COVID situation, which took place there. So that\u2019s one piece to keep in mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another piece to keep in mind is that from an India standpoint, we are -- now that we\u2019re out of the embargo and we\u2019ve started new issuance, you still have the tail effect of the embargo coming through. So said differently, the fact that you actually for a year were not issuing new cards in India has a resultant impact of attrition of old cards which are taking place, which need to be more than compensated for by issuance of new cards. And that takes time as issuers get ramped up and ready to go. So, you\u2019ve seen that come through in Q4 as well. But beyond that, I would say that we continue to see pretty good and consistent growth relative to 2019 levels across all our metrics here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And a step down compared to last year and the year before is, of course, there because you get the mathematics and the lapping effects and so forth. But to 2019, I think that\u2019s an instructive view here. And it tells us that, yes, we\u2019re expecting a resilient consumer will continue to spend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And, Will, you had asked the question about China. In my prepared remarks, I shared with you that China inbound cross-border travel pre-pandemic was roughly 1% of our total corresponding volumes, and our outbound -- the similar metric from an outbound standpoint was about 2%. So, I know that was the second part of your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go next to David Togut at Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Togut</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Europe continues to be a driver of differentiated growth for Mastercard. For the year ahead, could you talk through some of your assumptions on the biggest opportunities in Europe, Germany, Poland, Italy, when you think about both economic outlook and cash digitization? We\u2019ve seen mixed reports 6, 9 months ago, more concerned about Europe given high gas prices. Now, it seems like the outlook has been a little better with lower gas prices and a more mild winter. But, any insights would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Miebach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">David, let me start off on that. So, looking at Europe really in three categories, there\u2019s the UK on one hand and there\u2019s emerging Europe and then there is Continental Central Europe, and slightly different picture on all of them. First of all, starting off with the continent. Here, the concern has been around for a while on rising gas prices and energy prices and the impact on the consumers\u2019 ability to spend. A combination of fiscal measures to provide cushions to consumers, along with energy-saving measures, along with the gas storage now reaching full capacity has really alleviated some of these concerns. So, we continue to see a fairly resilient European consumer. That\u2019s our base assumption as we look forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">UK, somewhat different economic outlook, and that might be a little more shaky there. But fundamentally, in this market, we are seeing a lot of tailwind for us from share gains over the last couple of years. So that works well for us. And emerging Europe continues to be a dramatic digitization opportunity as we\u2019ve seen in markets like Russia, which unfortunately is not in our P&amp;L any longer. But we have seen very high digitization rates, and we\u2019re pushing that in these more emerging markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Somewhere between, there\u2019s peculiarities like Germany, where there was a significant digitization opportunity, and there still remains. But we caught up a lot in Germany over the last two years, particularly on the contactless side, which is now reaching half of the transactions there. So, healthy mix in Europe and very strong share position with opportunities to come through from portfolio wins that we have shared with you over the last couple of years as they go into effect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019ll just add, David, to Michael\u2019s point around the deals which we\u2019ve recently won and announced. Just to give you a little bit of perspective, we had talked about Santander historically. That migration is in progress. And we\u2019re through the bulk of a 9 million card migration there. We expect to be complete by early 2023 on that one. NatWest commenced the issuance of Mastercard debit cards in December of 2021. That\u2019s well underway, and we would expect some of that to continue to happen in 2023. And then, the other one we had spoken about historically was Deutsche Bank, and we expect that the migration of one will commence somewhere in the middle of 2023. So, just to give you a little bit of sense as to how we\u2019re kind of thinking about things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll move next to Ashwin Shirvaikar at Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ashwin Shirvaikar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to drill into a couple of things, now that we\u2019re getting rid of 2019 over the past few years. And looking forward, what has changed in terms of the growth algo? How should we think of that as we think of normalized growth visibility? And then, there\u2019s a smaller question with regards to - specifically for \u201823, the spread between [indiscernible] how should one think of that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to need a little bit more clarity on the second part of your question, but we\u2019ll get to that. Let me take the first question first, which is as it relates to the growth algorithm. Just suffice it to say that the fundamentals of our business actually are very, very sound. The growth algorithm, which has actually enabled the strong growth we have delivered pre-pandemic, very much stands sound even today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the reality is, if you think about PCE growth, you think about the opportunity for the secular shift to electronic forms of payment, you think about the fact that we\u2019re growing market share, you think about how we\u2019re delivering on our services capabilities and driving growth from that, and now as we\u2019re doing new and different things around new payment flows as well as new networks, that growth algorithm actually is very sound, very stable, very consistent with what we\u2019ve historically had. And that\u2019s the way we think about the business for, call it, not only the near term but near medium to long term for Mastercard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, Ashwin, I\u2019m not sure I got the second part of your question. Could you repeat that, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ashwin Shirvaikar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I was asking about the cross-border volume spread. How should one think of that as we think of this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Look, I mean, our cross-border proposition sound -- is very sound and stable. And I think at the end of the day, like I said, most of the regions are now back to what I would call, the stable growth rates that we would normally have seen in the pre-pandemic phase. The one exception is Asia, and there\u2019s a little bit of opportunity which we have in Asia, which we\u2019ve contemplated in our thoughts for 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll move next to Ken Suchoski at Autonomous Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Suchoski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, Michael and Sachin. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the cross-border recovery. We see the volumes for cross-border travel are well above 2019 levels. Where are you seeing the transactions versus 2019 levels on that same metric? Sachin, you made some interesting comments on price versus units. And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for how much the cross-border travel volumes are benefiting from inflation and spend per transaction, and how much recovery is still left from a number of transaction standpoint. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Ken. So my comment is actually going to hold true for not only cross-border for -- largely for the business, if you think about it, right? You know our transactions or the growth in our transactions is impacted by our average ticket size. There are puts and takes on the average ticket size, not only in cross-border but even on domestic, which are influenced by numerous factors, one of which is inflation. The others are the mix between card-present and card-not-present. Because what happens is, typically, with more card-not-present, you tend to see a higher average ticket size, which results in lower transaction growth rate. Now, that being said, also when you do more card-not-present, you have the opportunity to deliver more services. When you deliver more services, it allows you to actually have a compensating effect from a revenue standpoint. So, I think those are two important things to keep in mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The third, I would say, from an average ticket size standpoint, which impacts both cross-border and domestic, is what is the regional mix? Because different countries have different average ticket sizes, which influences what the growth rates are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specifically on cross-border average ticket, it has been pretty stable year-over-year. And our assumption, as we kind of think about this is, not knowing perfectly well where inflation is going to go and the variables I kind of talked about, those are those things we factor into our assumptions as it relates to transaction growth on a going-forward basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take that question from Dave Koning at Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dave Koning</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe just to go back a little bit to Q1 guidance. You talked a little bit about this, but I know revenue you\u2019ve got on a non-GAAP basis decelerating something like 5% or so. But every metric -- every core metric in January accelerated by kind of 4% to 11%. Is there just tougher comps coming on some of those key metrics, or is it rebates? Or maybe talk through a little bit about the gap and kind of what\u2019s going to happen in the rest of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sachin Mehra</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Dave. A couple of thoughts. One, in Q1, acquisitions contribute less to our Q1 growth than they did to our Q4 growth because you\u2019re doing a sequential comparison between Q4 and Q1 in your question there. Number two, the suspension of operations in Russia has a greater impact in Q1 than it does in Q4. It\u2019s just the way the cadence of the revenues are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, two other points I\u2019d point out is Michael talked about the several wins we\u2019ve got -- active deal activity, which has been in play. We\u2019ve got to contemplate all of that in our Q1 kind of thoughts. And then, the last piece I\u2019d mention is we did have elevated levels of FX volatility in Q4. I don\u2019t know where FX volatility is going to play out. We\u2019ve done our best assumptions around that, but those would be the contributing factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Warren Kneeshaw</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Michael, any final comments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Miebach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, thanks for your questions. Thanks for your trust. Rayna, we will figure out your questions offline. We couldn\u2019t get to those, unfortunately. The day will come when there\u2019s a call where there\u2019s more questions for me than for Sachin. I\u2019m still hopeful. We will get there at some point. But the story has been resilient consumer, and we still see some opportunity in cross-border for Asia. That\u2019s the base. We\u2019re winning. That feels good as we look ahead into 2023. And we have 28,000 excited people at Mastercard that are going to deliver on that opportunity. With that, thank you very much and speak to you next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sachin Mehra</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.</p>", "twitContent": "$MA - Mastercard Incorporated (MA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572706-mastercard-incorporated-ma-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "903", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "586376", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4572706-mastercard-incorporated-ma-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4572706-mastercard-incorporated-ma-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
