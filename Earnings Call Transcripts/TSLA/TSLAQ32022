My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.</p> <p>During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the Q&amp;A session portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.</p> <p>But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?</p> <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Martin. So just to do a Q3 recap. Q3 was another record quarter on many levels. We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%. And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we\u2019re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, looks like we\u2019ll have an epic end of year. So, Q4 is looking extremely good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon. And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday\u2019s build rate, it would be 2,000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont. The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially. Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we\u2019ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume. So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world. I can\u2019t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America. So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now. So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the safety that we\u2019re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we\u2019re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s see, with respect to demand. We\u2019ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can\u2019t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see. So, the factories are running at full speed, and we\u2019re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road. Of the 2 billion cars and trucks on the road, we only have about 3.5 million. So, we\u2019ve got a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s see. Based on many -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get on Twitter about buybacks. And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions about buybacks. We\u2019ve debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level. The Board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. But we want to work through the right process to do a buyback, but it\u2019s certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion, even in the downside scenario next year, even -- given if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback. This is obviously pending Board review and approval. So, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll do some meaningful buyback.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in conclusion, while the market themes revolve around the short term, it\u2019s very important to focus on the long term. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough with investors and I think long-time investors, obviously recognize it with Tesla. You have your sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trend has been extremely good. And several years ago, I said, I think on an earnings call, and I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market cap company, I think, in the market. And Apple at that time, I think it was around $700 billion. And I said it required incredible execution, at least some luck, and we did indeed achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple\u2019s market cap at the time. And now, I\u2019m of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple\u2019s current market cap. In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So, now that doesn\u2019t mean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difficult. It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck. But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let\u2019s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco. And I think that\u2019s -- I haven\u2019t quite seen that yet. I mean, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen that potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we\u2019ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you\u2019ve heard about, some of which you haven\u2019t. We\u2019re in the final lap for Cybertruck. We\u2019re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, with respect to batteries, we\u2019re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, [Indiscernible] refining, we\u2019re moving at top speed to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think it\u2019s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future. None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla. So, I\u2019d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team. You guys rock. You\u2019re the ones making it happen. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Martin Viecha</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Zachary Kirkhorn</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Martin. Just to continue on Elon\u2019s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage. However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we\u2019ve discussed at length on prior calls. In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we\u2019ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn\u2019t anticipate. This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter. Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks. As a result, we\u2019ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look ahead, our plans show that we\u2019re on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control. On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3. And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins. Thank you.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>A - Martin Viecha</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. And let\u2019s go first to the shareholder questions. The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla\u2019s ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I\u2019d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA\u2019s requirements. Do you want to add?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States. We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year. Until such time, it\u2019s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, like I said, we\u2019re -- like I said earlier, we\u2019re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Let\u2019s go to the next question. The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S. and especially in China?\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly. And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy. The U.S. actually isn\u2019t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they\u2019ll eventually realize that and bring back down again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be. But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production, sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we\u2019re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so. In fact, we\u2019re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren\u2019t enough boats, there weren\u2019t enough trains, there weren\u2019t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big. So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren\u2019t just enough transportation objects to move them around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future? Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market? Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising? There are three questions there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here. We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate. It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more. In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question is, \u201cCan you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We could, but who wants? Sorry, guys, we can\u2019t like jumping on, on future product announcement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Committed to continuing...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we obviously are -- yes. But we\u2019ll also be committed to continuous growth. Yes. At Tesla, we\u2019ve always been committed to continuous improvement. So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I\u2019m like now because we just keep improving the cars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s always the latest Tesla.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, there\u2019s still latest Tesla. I don\u2019t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid. And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth. There\u2019s nothing even close, in my opinion. Just try one. Epic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question is, \u201cWe keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter. What are Tesla\u2019s plans to combat power cuts? And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I can take that. I think two points on this question. The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don\u2019t see this as a large risk to the Company. Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn\u2019t have any impact on the long term of the Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we don\u2019t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. And we put in place backup plans, and we\u2019re working through the supply chain as well. Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well. So, we\u2019ll see how this plays out, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re terribly worried about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And the next question is, \u201cHow is production planning going for the Cybertruck? What is the initial Phase 1 production target? When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, as Elon said earlier, we\u2019d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck. We\u2019re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year. We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When should I drop my beta?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In a few weeks. That\u2019s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick. That is going to be a hall of famer, next level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of course. There\u2019s Tesla Semi, of course. So, we\u2019ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st. I\u2019ll be there in person. And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck. That\u2019s a Class A truck, Class A truck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No sacrifice to cargo capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range. Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo. Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground. Yes, sure. Not up. It\u2019s excellent. But the point is, it\u2019s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo. And the number of times people tell, no, you can\u2019t -- it\u2019s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck. And then, I\u2019ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen. I\u2019m like, no, that\u2019s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally. It\u2019s not a number. It\u2019s [indiscernible] table. You obviously don\u2019t need hydrogen for heavy truck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll be ramping up Semi production through next year. As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production. So, we expect to see significant -- we\u2019re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America. And obviously, we\u2019ll expand beyond North America. And these would sell -- I don\u2019t want to say the exact prices, but they\u2019re much more than a passenger vehicle. So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp? And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells? And how will that change in the next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said. Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter. Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing. And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially. And yes, it\u2019s going well. We\u2019re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Indiscernible]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And like I said, we\u2019re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, there\u2019s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when you\u2019re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel. The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it\u2019s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more. And then there\u2019s the manganese wildcard as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on that note, we\u2019re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies. And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed. So I\u2019m going to skip to the next one. Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, to be frank, we\u2019re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine. So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s the 1% point come in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, exactly. So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone\u2019s moving towards electric vehicles and that it\u2019s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low. So, I think we have to be in a very good spot. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s recession proof, but it\u2019s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power. So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn\u2019t go -- travel time. So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to add before you jump in, Martin. Just to echo Elon\u2019s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup. So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters. And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And we try to model out like, let\u2019s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year. Even then, we generate meaningful cash. Once you get out of that\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much. And let\u2019s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla\u2019s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold. When do you see Tesla\u2019s third platform being released? And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we don\u2019t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously. At this point, we\u2019ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi. So, it\u2019s obviously against what we\u2019re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform. It will be smaller, to be clear. But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, obviously, we\u2019re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform. But we -- as you\u2019ve said to us many times, we\u2019re on a 2-for-1 target. So, we\u2019re trying to get to that 50% number again. It\u2019s like, we\u2019re going to take two. That\u2019s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Effort costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re twice the output. And we do believe this can be done. By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn\u2019t including Optimus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Let\u2019s go to analyst questions next. The first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, go ahead and unmute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Adam Jonas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Can you hear me?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Adam Jonas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Elon, would you consider vertically integrating into mining? That\u2019s my first question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll do whatever we have to. Whatever the limiting factor is, we\u2019ll do. We do not personally constrain ourselves. We don\u2019t particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating. Like if there was a great supplier who\u2019s better than us or we think actively is very good, or even where the economics of comparative advantage suggest that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, but we could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in source in that case. But if we have to go mine, we will mine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Adam Jonas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Elon. My follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated. I guess, my question is, what would need to change with U.S. permitting laws to allow that? Kind of what would be your message to this administration or next? And do you think you could do a terawatt hour? What\u2019s the going price of that? Can you do that for under $100 billion in the States? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I mean, I think the message to the government would be that there should be -- I should say, we\u2019ve actually had conversations with a number of senior government leaders, White House, Congress and whatnot. And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expedited permitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future. So, it doesn\u2019t make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine in the same category. Coal does not in the future, lithium does. And by the way, you can extract lithium with almost no disturbance to the local environment. So, it\u2019s not actually ugly, nasty mine situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I would recommend expedited permitting would really be helpful. Basically, a fast track environmentally -- I think in sense fast track things that are important for the environment and humanity for sure. That seems logical. And the reception has been positive. So, we\u2019ll see if something happens with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think probably on this earnings call, we\u2019re not ready to go into financial details of the -- what it will take to get there. But what we are seeing is practical improvements as we redesign the whole supply chain and all of the elements that go into battery cell. We\u2019re figuring out dramatic efficiencies. And I think we\u2019ll -- net result which would be that the capital required to achieve that level of output will be much less than what people think.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, go ahead and unmute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Langan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you hear me now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we can hear you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Langan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Sorry about that. Any update on full self-driving? I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year. Is that still possible? Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you\u2019re talking about? And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you\u2019d have to think about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We -- as I said earlier, we\u2019re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year. So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval. It won\u2019t have regulatory approval at that time. But the car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend\u2019s house, to the grocery store without you touching wheel. So, it\u2019s looking very good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Langan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it would mean like Level 4, Level 5 kind of traditional definition you\u2019re talking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, there\u2019s - this debate is like what\u2019s the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per mile. Like we\u2019re not saying that that\u2019s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel. It\u2019s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent\u2019s house, I never touched any of the controls already here. And then there is a longer process of like called the march of nines of like how many nines reliability do you need before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it. And that\u2019s some subjectivity as to how many nines you need. But I think we\u2019ll be pretty close to having enough nines that you\u2019re going to have no one in the car by the end of this year. And certainly, without a question, that\u2019s whatever in my mind next year. I think we\u2019ll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the average human.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Langan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And just as a follow-up. You mentioned in the prior questions about IRA. I mean, it sounded like you thought you could get -- can you get all of it? I mean, because my interpretation is like the production credits, battery component credits for buyers seems very likely for you guys. Is the sourcing part of it possible? Because that seems like a pretty tough hurdle given how much has to be sourced from the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, we have a cross-functional team that\u2019s looking very closely. As you mentioned, the sourcing threshold increases by the year. So, we\u2019re looking at all options and also getting some clarification from Treasury. That\u2019s -- it\u2019s important to say that\u2019s only a fraction of the other credits. We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S. We manufacture the modules in the U.S. So, that\u2019s a pretty thin. So yes, we feel confident that we\u2019ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We\u2019ll meet those thresholds..</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Rusch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here. And I\u2019m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it\u2019s on the R&amp;D side or on the sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction, or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit. It\u2019s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue. I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing. I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the company grows. It\u2019s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it\u2019s growing much slower. So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly. So, I think there continues to be enormous opportunity to improve the overhead efficiency of the business, and we\u2019re seeing it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Look, we are in the -- at least for now, quite in a good position of -- we\u2019re investing in everything we can think of to possibly invest in, and we\u2019re still generating cash. So, I guess, it gets a pretty good place to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, how many R&amp;D programs are we running in parallel right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">People don\u2019t even know old R&amp;D stuff for that. There are some of it, but a bunch of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I also don\u2019t think cash is a good gauge of how much R&amp;D you\u2019re doing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. It isn\u2019t because like it\u2019s not like -- it\u2019s not like engineers -- they\u2019re not generic. So it\u2019s just like if you could you spend $5 billion or $10 billion, that will like -- that your actual R&amp;D -- useful product ship will be proportionate to that. It\u2019s just not true. Engineers on -- coming off some assembly line like cookies or something.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Until we get optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Get optimistic. Don\u2019t change things. What matters is where are the most brilliant people working? And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, like we don\u2019t have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future. Engineers are also cost conscious. And we don\u2019t just burn the money out the window when we\u2019re trying to do R&amp;D. I wouldn\u2019t stop looking at like R&amp;D as a cash investment for...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars. You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work 1 nickel of Tesla we can do. You can\u2019t make it up in volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s go to the next question from George at Canaccord.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Gianarikas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think, at your Annual Shareholders\u2019 event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil. If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we\u2019re looking at the prices of -- prices closely. I mean, obviously, anyone can just Google what the price of -- future price of copper or steel is going to be. It\u2019s just like one Google Search away. And everyone can see that the commodities on a go-forward basis are on a dropping a lot. But in electric vehicles, things like battery-grade lithium are still crazy expensive. So, we\u2019ve got a mixture of things where prices are dropping and things where prices are increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would say quarter-over-quarter, steel -- aluminum has stopped anywhere between 17% to 20% at the same time on the battery side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And cost of shipping has come down tremendously. Like last year, the cost of a container on the spot market from Shanghai got as high as $20,000. And now it\u2019s $3,500, $3,600. It\u2019s that kind of reality. We\u2019re seeing deflation in a lot of commodities with a few exceptions as Elon mentioned on batteries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s more deflation than inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Definitely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, this is publicly available information. Anyone could just Google it. And I think Cathie Wood at Ark Invest is making this point over and over again, to the Fed and the Fed is not listening because they\u2019re looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Just to add a little bit more context. So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we\u2019ve seen over the last two years. And so, when indexes change, it does take time before they fully reflect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. There\u2019s latency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. There\u2019s latency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s why I say that the Fed\u2019s decisions make sense if you\u2019re looking out through the rearview mirror, but not if you look out the windshield. And actually we\u2019ve got front windshield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And so what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3 -- I say peak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down. There is a small amount of production that we\u2019re seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily, but it\u2019s less than 10% of the total increases we\u2019ve seen so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re optimistic here based upon what we\u2019re seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure that this will start to come in over time. But I just want to set expectations that there\u2019s not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, maybe some as we go into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We\u2019ll probably see some cost reduction in 2023. I\u2019ll be surprised if we did not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Gianarikas</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon. With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not clear to me what the overlap is. It\u2019s not zero, but it\u2019s -- I think we\u2019re reaching. I\u2019m not worried about it. I\u2019m not an investor. I\u2019m an engineer and a manufacturing person and a technologist. So, I actually work and design and develop products. That\u2019s what I do. So, it\u2019s not a -- we\u2019re not going to have a portfolio sort of investments over it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see obvious sort of some -- get combined under an umbrella, at least right now. So, I am excited about the Twitter situation because obviously another part incredibly well. And I think it\u2019s massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential. Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is, in order of magnitude, greater than its current value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Pierre Ferragu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you hear me, guys?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we can hear you now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Pierre Ferragu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. I\u2019d love to have another update on 4680, Drew. So last time we talked about it, there were -- it was a question about like scaling up with manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right. Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it\u2019s just a question of logistics to get bigger? So, that\u2019s question number one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efficiency improvements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today? And how much time is it going to take to deliver all the potential you outlined then?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I\u2019ll take the second question first. At Battery Day, we showed a time line out to 2026 for all of the ideas we had proposed and had shared with everybody then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019d be surprised. I think we\u2019ll do better than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, but just that\u2019s the rough -- just give to you all -- it\u2019s on that order. It\u2019s not like a month. It\u2019s not six months. It\u2019s years. And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively in parallel with the OpEx that some people think isn\u2019t enough, but we\u2019re getting it done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, I\u2019m turning down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, yes. We\u2019re great talent, like we find someone awesome, we bring them into the company. And people shouldn\u2019t believe we are turning people away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, it\u2019s a hot pond but we\u2019re solving it. And I think -- we still feel confident that 4680 will be the most competitive battery cell in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s the whole system around it, right? It\u2019s not necessarily a specific form factor. It\u2019s the attention to detail on how to bring costs out of the manufacturing process -- or remove processing steps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And all the way down from the mine to the cell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, exactly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Many steps along the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And for those who watched the YouTube videos, like our on-site cathode facilities coming together, I\u2019m really excited about that, which is a part of the plan that we discussed on Battery Day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We\u2019re also building lithium refinery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Corpus Christi. So, we\u2019re making -- putting our money where our mouths are and all the various efforts that we discussed on Battery Day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the technical challenges and the ramp question, which is your first question of 4680, no ramp is ever easy even at the end when you\u2019re 80% to the end, like it\u2019s still very challenging to get to the end. And that sort of leaning out of yields, the final cycle time to achieve target. You mentioned logistics. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019re specifically focused on, I guess, but eventually could be a problem as we\u2019re talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the United States. But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining, but we\u2019ve made a lot of progress reducing technical risk in many areas. Cycle times have dramatically improved. Yield has dramatically improved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking it yesterday, made some comments to me. You really see the acceleration around you. And we\u2019ve made a ton of simplifications moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it\u2019s coming to play in speed of ramp here. And of course, that\u2019s on one line of many here in Texas. So it\u2019s not like factory to factory. It\u2019s a multiplication of both, simplicity and scale. So yes, we\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s headed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $70 a kilowatt hour cell -- $70 per kilowatt hour cell, before any incentive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before incentive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before incentive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toni Sacconaghi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today. So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st? Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin? And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year? And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023? And I have a follow-up, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. The Semi doesn\u2019t use 4680s. Yes. We are making Model Ys. Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680. And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. 10,000 miles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">10,000 miles. Pretty good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No problems yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Structural pack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Structural pack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And yes, I mean -- and our output 4680 is growing exponentially. But it\u2019s worth bearing in mind like there are entire highly competitive companies that are very smart that all they do is make battery cells. This is simply one segment of Tesla. So, it\u2019s not a total...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, there aren\u2019t -- there are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We don\u2019t anticipate this being anything -- like Cybertruck or anything else.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">William Stein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess, I\u2019ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors. FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%. And I think we\u2019ll -- we\u2019re almost there. And then, of course, we\u2019ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control. But anyone who\u2019s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement. You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there. In fact, we almost are there. And so, we\u2019re probably -- achieving that 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it\u2019s also extremely high given enough time, 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs. So the jury is out on Dojo. Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training. The jury\u2019s out. We will probably know -- I don\u2019t know, next year, if that\u2019s true or not. But we think we\u2019ll probably -- we think it\u2019s -- this is -- the architecture of Dojo is the right architecture to win. Yes. It depends on how well we execute in that architecture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Martin Viecha</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. I think, unfortunately, it\u2019s all the time that we have today. So, thank you so much for your great questions, and look forward to talking to you in about three months from now. Thank you, and have a good day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, everyone.</p>", "twitContent": "$TSLA - Tesla, Inc.
