Well thank you so much Evan and just thanks to everyone for being on the call today. I hope you and your families and colleagues are all safe and healthy and preparing for the holiday season. It\u2019s nice and crisp and cold here in San Francisco, and we can feel Christmas approaching. It\u2019s all in the air and as the season approaches, I wish the very best to you. It\u2019s been such an unbelievable year in so many ways for so many of us, and you know we\u2019ve really had to re-imagine every part of our business and our lives and also work with so many of our customers, and really even our families to do the very same thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The past has really gone, and we can all feel that. And the future is coming. We can see there\u2019s certainly a light at the end of the tunnel, especially with these incredible vaccine announcements, but here we are in this present moment, and wow there\u2019s so many things happening and so many exciting things to talk to you about on this call today, and we're reimagining our entire business, we're reimagining our industry, and we're even reimagining Dreamforce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So many of you have emailed me and called me and talked to me about your ideas for Dreamforce. But I'll tell you, when it really comes right down to it, Dreamforce is different this year, just is, you know, it's not the Dreamforce that we wanted, it's the Dreamforce that we got. The Dreamforce that we wanted is the Dreamforce with all of you. You know all of our trailblazers and all of our Ohana and all of our friends from all over the world, the best part of Dreamforce is being together in person. And there was a little bit like Thanksgiving all by ourselves last week, and here we are again, it's kind of Dreamforce by ourselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we've re-imagined Dreamforce. And the first thing we did is, we said, \u201cwell, you know what, we're going to have Dreamforce for each and every customer,\u201d and we've already reached out to thousands and thousands of our customers. We're creating custom Dreamforces exactly for them. We've already done almost 5,000 of those Dreamforces, which has been our prototype, and we hope to do over 100,000 Dreamforces before we're done, and these are unique presentations exactly for our most important customers in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then we have a huge conference coming in a couple weeks which is our Dreamforce Trailblazer Conference, which gives ability for all our Trailblazers to come together; and then tomorrow, we've got a phenomenal event with myself, with many of our executives, Bret who\u2019s going to join me on stage as well, it\u2019s going to be live from San Francisco. It's going to be cold. We're going to be doing it outside. I think Bret's holding the camera for a while and I'm holding the camera for a while. It's basically, you know, we're following all these protocols, and we're trying to stay as safe as we can, you know, we've all been tested, and we're ready to go. And it's going to be very excited and we're going to have some very, very special guests tomorrow, some great customers and some really outstanding music, you're not going to want to miss that presentation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by the way, if you'd like to have Dreamforce to you, please contact our Salesforce executives, and we will arrange Dreamforce for your company. You'll be shocked at the depth and incredible custom presentation that we're able to bring for you, and we've re-imagined how to do a conference. We're not doing it like everybody else. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have our own unique approach, of course, you would expect nothing less of Salesforce. And one thing that's really cool is how well Dreamforce to you is going. I want to thank my entire Dreamforce team. I've definitely got them working much harder than they should be working, especially during this holiday season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, look, we're going to have some exciting announcements, surprises, you're not going to want to miss it. All of you need to tune into that, but the keynote again is just one part of an amazing month of Dreamforce 2020, it's Dreamforce to you. We\u2019re powering every account executive in our company to do this, it's going to be amazing, and you're going to love it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let's get right into it. Let's get into the numbers and get out of this opening. This was an unbelievable year, and that was an unbelievable quarter. Q3, wow, it was our strongest Q3 ever. You know, record revenues and margins and just deals and just unbelievable. And it follows the strongest Q2 in our history, and Salesforce has never been stronger. Look at our core organic growth. It's just incredible what the numbers say. Revenue has risen to 5.42 billion, up 19% year-over-year in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By the way, if you look at that sequential growth from the second quarter at 5.15 billion to 5.42 billion, incredible. And, you know, this is 19% year-over-year in constant currency, and we're raising our full year fiscal 2021 guidance. Now, as you remember in the first quarter, the pandemic was hitting and we didn't know what was going on. We were hiding like everyone else under our desks, then we realized, wait a minute, we can succeed through this. And here's our guidance. And Mark, I think it's our guidance is now higher than our original guidance for the year where we're actually delivering guidance at 21.11 billion at the high-end of the range representing 23% growth. So, not only did we come back, we came back stronger, and no other enterprise software company is growing at this rate, especially in our core and organically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect our revenue to continue expanding, growing from 21.1 billion this year, to now over 25.5 billion. And for those of you who are watching the enterprise software industry over the last, I don't know, four or five decades, I don't think there's been an enterprise software company in history that's gone from 21 billion, or 21.1 billion to 25.5 billion, and we're all modeling I'm sure right now, what the fiscal year 2023 number is, right. So, when you look at those numbers, wow, you just can't, you just can't find any other company like that. And with the strength of our core products across sales, across service, across marketing, commerce, we\u2019re growing year-over-year the size of entire companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we have a lot of great companies in cloud computing, but you can see how we're kind of just stacked one of those right on top of us here. So, Salesforce has never been more relevant, more strategic to our customers. An example of this is what we've already seen this past week with the incredible scale, the reliability, the strength of our customer 360 platform this weekend. We were up all weekend running Cyber Week. It was incredible. From Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we processed more than 31 million orders. It was up 62% year-over-year, but not, you know, just thank you to our engineering team.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just absolutely world-class performance and execution by them. Huge, [high fives] Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, well, you know that those were started as acquisitions. And now we've turned it into a multi-billion dollar business. And now with Tableau, well, our customers were able to leverage all the data coming in spotting the trends. It's been a phenomenal weekend with these holiday insights. You probably watch that online. You've probably seen some of our incredible Tableau dashboards we put together and on any given day now you can see our customers are delivering an average of 2.6 billion marketing messages, [4 million lease, logging] 19.7 customer service conversation. Einstein delivered more than 80 billion AI powered predictions every day across Customer 360, incredible. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Salesforce then takes all of that in sales and service, in marketing, in platform, in analytics, in conversation, in channels, in collaboration, and we lock it into a single source of truth for our customers. Connecting customer data across systems, apps, and devices, and for our customers who have now seen this next generation architecture, and you're going to see our next generation platform tomorrow, but I don't want to give away too much of what Brett Taylor has built, but it's incredible, but let me say that that idea of the single source of truth, well no one else has ever tried to do such a thing. And it's why for the seventh year in a row we've now been ranked the world's number one CRM by IDC. That's why companies of every size and every industry are building amazing digital experiences for their customers with our scalable, flexible Customer 360 technology. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you look at this quarter, great customers, great customers like Prudential, Accenture, NBC Universal, Telefonica, Zoom, Data California, I mean, American Family Insurance, [Timok]. I mean, so many great companies; so many great customers and it\u2019s why 43 states of the United States are working with us on the response now to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You probably saw us, we have even helped or fully eradicate COVID in some places in the world, including great State of Victoria in Australia, where they had a terrible situation and used Work.com and they have now announced that they\u2019ve eradicated the virus, and I wish that we could work more closely with more governments, more deeply to do exactly the same thing, because the combination of mask wearing and social distancing and religious contact tracing well, boom, you can eradicate the virus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well very excited to see them and congratulations to the State of Victoria, I also this quarter was in Singapore visiting our 1,100 Ohana there, and I\u2019ll tell you, they\u2019ve eradicated the virus there, you can see the chart, unbelievable. Now our customers are benefiting from the fast time-to-value we deliver with Customer 360, which has been critical during this pandemic and it\u2019s going to remain so going forward. And with MuleSoft and Tableau every company can easily unlock any data from any source and see and understand in ways that are leading these faster, smarter decisions, and the customer reactions when they see these Customer 360s. The eyes are lighting up, because they\u2019ve never seen their business quite like this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, well, now let me just tell you what I\u2019m really excited about. Slack, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about what Bret and Stuart have put together. Wow, I mean, when they came to me and brought me this idea that Salesforce and Slack to come together, my eyes lit up. I said this is the next generation of the Customer 360. This is our ultimate vision of having this incredible user interface on top of all of these services with all these channels and all the collaboration running on all of these devices and integration, interactions, and the ecosystem, and the industry that has been created around it and all the applications amazing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And let me just say also, I\u2019ve watched Stewart and Slack grow up over the last six years, it\u2019s been amazing, it\u2019s reminded me of another great company Salesforce. I have to be honest, and I get to look right out my window do you know what I see, Slack, Slack logo, because Slack building is right next to my building and I\u2019m looking into their building all the time. Stewart is waving at me, now I\u2019m waiving at him. Now, we\u2019re giving each other big hugs when the pandemic is over. With that idea that these two great companies are right next to each other in Salesforce Park is amazing. And Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms and brands, okay, and technologies in the software industry and it\u2019s a perfect match for both of us that\u2019s going to extend our companies, make us both stronger and look, we\u2019ve spent more than a decade focusing on this vision that we\u2019ve had for social enterprise, everyone probably remembers [indiscernible]. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All of the social enterprise presentations that I\u2019ve delivered in my career, this makes it all real, this makes it all true, this brings the best of both worlds. The integration, it\u2019s a marriage made in heaven, it\u2019s amazing and we spent more than, God, I can\u2019t even think about how many conversations Parker and I have had on the vision and then to see Stewart come in with Bret and make it all real, well, that\u2019s just awesome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we see in Slack a once-in-a-generation company and platform, it\u2019s the central nervous system of so many companies on this call and our company and so many of our great customers connecting everyone and everything and now we could go even bigger, better, more exciting and it brings all the companies, people, the data, the tools together and you can see all the CRM information, the sales, customer interactions, you probably saw Slack Connect, which extends the benefit of Slack\u2019s employees can securely work collaboratively with partners, suppliers, but especially important for us, customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wow, that\u2019s the game changer. And when I\u2019ve seen this incredible story line that what Bret and Stewart have put together, it is like, wow. This is bigger than I\u2019ve ever thought it could be. And when I looked at the companies from around the world we\u2019re implementing Slack from the fastest growing start-ups to Fortune 500 companies and Starbucks and Target and HP and what they\u2019re doing and then when we integrate that with the single source of truth, oh boy, it\u2019s a super charger. So, we already know more than 90% of Slack, enterprise customers are also Salesforce customers, but we also see how much farther they can go, because we just use ourselves as an example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we\u2019re a great Slack customer, but we could be doing so much more, but when it\u2019s integrated to a Salesforce, it\u2019s like wow, and that\u2019s what I plan to bring that message to all my friends, all these CEOs that I work with all over the world to help them transform their business and grow their businesses and helping them to survive and succeed during this pandemic. Well, we\u2019re going to make sure that they just have this incredible single source of truth experience as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, we\u2019ve already shown with ExactTarget, with Demandware, with Mulesoft, with Tableau, how we acquired, how we can integrate, how we extend acquisitions, how we transform our own product line, how we can develop compelling models for our customers to get value and we\u2019ll expand Slack as well in the enterprise, not just among Salesforce customers, not just by lighting up our tens of thousands of salespeople that\u2019s not what this is all about. What this is all about is the value of the social enterprise and creating this incredible idea that you have this amazing hub of productivity of collaboration and integration and applications that now leverage all of this amazing data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I mean you probably saw, if you watch the Tableau Conference-ish this year, the vision they\u2019ve had for Tableau integrated with Slack, you look at what Salesforce has done, I mean, it\u2019s absolutely incredible and by the way look at what Zoom is doing with Slack is absolutely incredible and you look at that product. I mean, i.e., you\u2019re talking about my productivity environment every day, Zoom and Slack and Tableau, oh yeah, and Salesforce and all the applications and dashboards and everything I use to run my business is all Salesforce now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Everything on my desktop here. I\u2019ve got my computer in front of me right now and everything is Salesforce. And I\u2019m like, wow, this is just absolutely incredible. So, congratulations Stewart, Bret, I just want to give you a huge call out, because awesome what you have done and I never thought it was even possible, never wasn\u2019t even in my consciousness that it could be possible and you did it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, before I turn this over to Mark Hawkins, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve now already seen that absolutely one of our very best CFOs we have ever had is retiring and it\u2019s just sad to see Mark go. I\u2019m going to try to keep him around in the company as long as I can. I think, I\u2019m going to have some good success, because let me just tell you, he is absolutely \u2013 I really think Mark you\u2019re absolutely \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t want to \u2013 we have especially Steve and Graham out there such great close friends of all of ours with mine and yours as well Mark, but Mark, wow, you\u2019ve really outdone yourself. What a career you had at Salesforce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019m just so grateful for everything that you have done for the company and I am so grateful Mark for everything that you\u2019ve done for the industry and also your relationships with all the CFOs, when I look at your incredible CFO conference that you run at Dallas, when I look at your work that you have done as well with Prince Charles, with sustainable accounting. When I see the value that you\u2019ve added for the whole world not just at Salesforce, not just in the industry, but in the world what these new sustainable accounting standards, Mark, I am deeply grateful to you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I want to tell you that Mark is going to remain our CFO through the end of our fiscal year, which is going to end January 31 and then Mark I believe you\u2019re going to stay on and as an advisor hopefully for quite some time. And then at that point, I am absolutely delighted to announce our new Chief Financial Officer, who has been on a few of our calls here, you all know her, she is an amazing person, a core part of our executive team, a core part of our entire company, core with our Board of Directors, my core [indiscernible], Amy Weaver. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Amy congratulations as our new Chief Financial Officer. I couldn\u2019t be happier for you and I know that Mark also joins me in sending you congratulations, we\u2019ll hear from him in a second. And Amy will become our President and our Chief Financial Officer effective February 1 next year. So congratulations Amy, you are now going to become our fifth CFO at Salesforce. So then probably the five best CFOs in the world. I can\u2019t imagine you\u2019re joining this incredible group and you \u2013 Amy to have you as our fifth CFO, I mean, unbelievable and Mark, thank you again, because I will always be so grateful for your tenure and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to have a smooth transition of power and looking forward to hearing your announcement of your new cabinet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mark, when I look at how you have been such an important part of our success over the last six years with revenue growing five-times over 20 billion, actually 21.1 billion this year Mark. And our market cap reaching more than 200 billion, employees growing over 54,000 a day, and Mark you set the foundation and you know this is just the beginning and you\u2019re lighting up my $50 billion dream, so aggressively and we all know it takes a great CFO to help scale a company that, well, you know, I\u2019m very grateful for this. And Amy, you you\u2019ve been that trusted advisor, I mean, it\u2019s all one family, so I know this is going to be a seamless transition. But my heart is really filled with gratitude.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now let me turn this over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Hawkins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Hawkins</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Marc. First of all, I can\u2019t thank you enough and I\u2019m going to come back to those comments at the end, but to say there is gratitude is a huge understatement to me, to say that to you personally. You\u2019ve been amazing and for the entire Salesforce team and I\u2019ll talk a little bit more at the end and I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working with Amy, who is \u2013 I\u2019m going to talk more about as well, just an amazing executive, an amazing friend and partner. So, I\u2019m going to come back to that, but I just have to say that Marc I\u2019m incredibly grateful deeply. I\u2019m going to come back to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to say that I hope everyone had a safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving, despite these challenging times. And as Marc described, we delivered another record quarter in Q3 with durable topline revenue growth, as well as strong operating margin performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And let me take you through some of the results for Q3 and I\u2019ll begin with top line commentary. Total revenue for the third quarter was 5.42 billion, up 20% year-over-year and up 19% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at the drivers of growth, we had strength across geographies and across clouds. Our subscription and support revenue growth by Cloud was as follows: sales grew 12%; service grew 21%; marketing and commerce grew 25%; platform and other grew 24%. I\u2019d say also that revenue attrition in Q3 remained between the 9% and 10% range and continues to remain modestly better than we were guiding during our Q1 earnings call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our remaining performance obligation representing all future revenues under contract ended Q3 at approximately 30.3 billion, up 17% year-over-year. And as a reminder, this metric includes both new business and renewal contracts. Current remaining performance obligation or CRPO is all the future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months and it was approximately 15.3 billion, up 19% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Q3, GAAP EPS was $1.15 and our non-GAAP EPS was $1.74. The outperformance in the quarter was driven primarily by higher revenue, as well as realized and unrealized gains on the strategic investment portfolio notably, due to Snowflake and the IPO there. These mark-to-market adjustments benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.83 and non-GAAP by approximately $0.86.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to cash flow. Operating cash flow was $339 million, up 14% year-over-year. CapEx for the quarter was a $124 million, leading to a free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less CapEx of 215 million, up 68% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2021. Coming off a strong Q3 result, we are pleased to be raising our full-year fiscal 2021 revenue guidance to 21.1 billion to 21.11 billion, representing approximately 23% year-over-year growth. This guidance includes approximately 120 million of revenue from Velocity and 20 million, an increase from Velocity in the prior announcement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Q4, we expect revenue to be 5.665 billion to 5.675 billion, representing approximately 17% growth. We are proud to be raising our revenue guide back to our pre-pandemic expectations, and Marc is absolutely right at the high end, it\u2019s slightly higher than we started the year with. We\u2019re thankful to all of our customers and our partners for the success. And now as we enter Q4, which is our largest quarter of the year we are going to build on the momentum for Q2 and Q3. The pandemic has also empowered us to re-imagine how we operate in this work from anywhere digital world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earlier in the year, we shared with you our pandemic strategy of investing in our customers, our community and our employees. This included PPE donations, bonuses to our sales org, pivoting away from physical events, scaling our organization, while pulling forward growth hiring into this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in Q3, we continue to re-imagine our operations. After analyzing our global lease commitments, we now plan to consolidate in sublease select locations. While this acceleration of our personal digital transformation in the post pandemic world is happening, we do expect this to result in a one-time Q4 charge of approximately 80 million to 100 million. Please note that these charges represent an immaterial amount of our global portfolio and do not include our headquarter locations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">After incorporating these and our updated revenue guidance, we are maintaining our fiscal our 2021 non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 17.6%, which is year-over-year improvement of 75 basis points. As you can see, this year\u2019s performance, margin is a choice. When we net these pandemic driven investments against T&amp;E savings that the pandemic produced the result of slight operating margin headwind of approximately 50 basis points for the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, in these times of crisis, it\u2019s more important than ever to invest and support our stakeholders, our customers, our community and our employees. Therefore, our fiscal 2021 GAAP EPS will be $4.14 to $4.15, while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $4.62 to $4.63. For Q4 GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $0.05 to $0.06, while non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $0.73 to $0.74. And as a reminder, our EPS guidance assumes no future contribution for mark-to-market accounting as required by ASU 2016/01.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For operating cash flow, we\u2019re maintaining our fiscal 2021 guidance of 12% to 13% year-over-year and we continue to expect our CapEx to be approximately 3% in fiscal 2021 resulting in a free cash flow growth rate of approximately 15% to 16% for the fiscal year. We expect operating cash flow to continue to be impacted by the growth and investments that we described last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect CRPO to grow approximately 16% year-over-year in Q4, which is consistent with our initial revenue projections for next year after excluding the acquisitions of Slack and Acumen Solutions. Additionally, the pandemic continues to result and modestly higher revenue attrition than our pre-COVID expectations assumed and therefore will be a very slight headwind to near-term growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding our fiscal 2022 revenue guidance, we project it to be 25.45 billion to 25.55 billion, representing 21% growth. This includes the contribution from Slack of 600 million net of purchase accounting and assumes a closing date in late Q2. Acumen Solutions, the assumption is 150 million net of purchase accounting, which assumes a closing date within Q2. Both of these acquisitions will be fantastic additions to our Ohana as they will greatly benefit our strategic priorities of Customer 360 and industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d also like to provide some additional insight into our revenue guidance for Q1 of fiscal 2022, which we expect to be 5.68 billion to 5.715 billion, up approximately 17% year-over-year. As a reminder, we\u2019re providing this guidance given that our term license revenue business that is MuleSoft and Tableau have a more seasonal revenue profile in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To close, we delivered a strong Q3 despite the pandemic. We are proud of our ability to successfully partner with our customers through this adversity, while continuing to serve all of our stakeholders around the world. Additionally, I\u2019d like to encourage all of you and your firms to join us on December 8 for our Annual Investor Day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now for some personal comments. As Marc mentioned, I made a decision to retire as an Operating Officer and from Salesforce. I\u2019m amazingly humbled, grateful, and proud of having the opportunity to be 40-years in technology. I\u2019m excited to begin my next journey, you know, spending time with my family; doing some voluntary and doing some incremental board work. But first, of course, there is a really important matter of Q4 and then also really strongly supporting this transition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I just want to say that I am excited about the future for Salesforce and I\u2019m excited also about the next leg of the journey for myself. I really deeply believe we are in a great position of strength and we are getting stronger as a company with so many indicators to evidence that. I will be the company\u2019s strongest advocate once we go through this nearly year of a transition, which I\u2019m excited to be a part of. And I get to work hand-in-hand with a dear friend Amy Weaver, who I have the utmost respect for as an executive, as a partner and who is going to be an amazing CFO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I conclude my personal our remarks, I do want to say a special thank you to all the Salesforce Ohana, a special thank you to my boss Marc Benioff, who is a great friend and somebody I will always treasure the relationship with and who has been incredibly kind to me and to my team and to the broader company, and I want to thank our investors for all your support over a long period of time as a public CFO and some of the others to thank the ELT and the board, but I\u2019ll stop at that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And let me turn it over to Amy. Amy, I can\u2019t wait, I\u2019m just going to tell you the same, I can\u2019t wait to really begin this next leg of the journey with you and I\u2019ll give you a virtual hug if I can, but we\u2019re going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to be an exciting year ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Amy over to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amy Weaver</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Mark. It has been an absolute joy to partner with you over the last [6 years] and I have to say that one of the best part of taking the role of the CFO is that I get to work even more closely with you throughout this transition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This week I\u2019ve been thinking back to when I joined Salesforce seven years ago, we had just under 13,000 employees and had not yet crossed $4 billion in revenue. Today, we now have more than 54,000 employees and guiding over $21 billion and what\u2019s attracting the most is that we still got so much growth ahead of us. My focus will be to support that momentum as we continue to grow, as well as the scale of the business efficiently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019m very much looking forward to continuing to work closely with our entire executive team and our Board of Directors, as well as going to partner with our shareholders in the coming months. I am just incredibly grateful for this opportunity and the faith in me and taking an incredibly excited about the future of the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that Evan, shall we open up the call for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Hynes with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Hynes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks very much for taking the questions and Mark Hawkins congrats on the well deserved retirement. You're certainly going out with a bang here. Maybe this question is for Marc Benioff. It sounds like maybe Bret, given, he was kind of the architect of the Slack deal, I'm curious, looks Slack\u2019s going to give you access to huge amounts of, you know rich conversational customer data. How do you see that kind of advancing your efforts around AI? And I guess maybe just related to that, I think we all know what Slack is today, but what\u2019s your vision for what it could be with Salesforce in, you know, three to five years from now? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, let me give you two minutes, and then or a minute, and let me have Bret come in next to fill in the details. You know, when I look back at the dreams that we've had of what the social enterprise means over the last couple decades, it's a very rich user interface that kind of front ends all of our services and kind of in the way graphical user interfaces were a major moment in our computer industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think these collaborative interfaces and video-based interfaces are the next major moment in our industry. But underneath those services and you've kind of teed it up by asking the question this way, you have so many rich services, applications, integrations, artificial intelligence, and fundamentally big, you know, big data lakes. And the idea is, how can you take all of that and bring it to the user, to the power professional, to the worker, to the knowledge user, or even to the CEO and turn it into a powerful experience?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And now this combination of Slack and Salesforce, exactly as I mentioned, you know, my whole world is on this platform, and we call it Customer 360, but the idea that gee, number one, there's never been a more important time for sales and B2B sales. I see that with our customers every day, I look at our salesforce, obviously, it's enormous, but our ability to call at every level, our ability to call into the CEO level easily, our ability to have much higher levels of productivity with our sales organization, how we had to move our call centers and customer service organizations on a moment's notice into their homes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our ability to deliver record levels of marketing and marketing interactions like we did this weekend. The analytics that are needed, and you probably saw the analytics that we published around the holiday. Well, now all of that completely coupled with this incredible collaborative interface. And that is the magic. And that is what it's so exciting. That's been our dream. Now, it's our reality. And I want to introduce you to the person who put all of these things together, and that's Bret Taylor. So Bret, do you want to take this to another level?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bret Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, thanks, Mark. I mean, I think you really contextualized it well. I mean, fundamentally, we really see the world as fundamentally having shifted this year. We're entering into this all-digital work anywhere world, and every executive that I talked to, and every industry is doing this not as something temporary, but really a moment that accelerated the digitization of the economy. Consumer goods have gone from, you know, retailers to direct consumer. Medical care has gone from doctor\u2019s offices to Telehealth. Retail has gone from brick-and-mortar to curbside pickup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Marketing, as Marc mentioned, this last weekend is a perfect indication of this. We saw mobile push mode notifications go up 131%. We saw SMS grow 171%. Behind all of this is fundamental shifts in the way we work, fundamental consumer behaviors and fundamental changes in behaviors and every interaction. And I think we really view Slack as really the system of engagement for every employee, for every partner, and for every customer interaction. And I think in this all-digital work anywhere world, when you think what does it mean to be successful in sales, what does it mean to be successful in customer service and marketing, e-commerce, it really is about facilitating this all-digital, work-from-anywhere world to enable team selling, to enable people in a contact center to swarm on a case digitally whether or not you're in the same building, to enable marketers to plan a campaign, to enable merchandisers to plan what goes on the front page of a commerce app or a commerce website. .</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And, you know, we've been using this phrase, really, this is the operating system for the new way to work. And you know, our customers are coming to us now recognizing that because the economy has shifted so dramatically so quickly, they're pivoting from saying, \u201chow do we respond to the crisis, how do we grow, and how do we thrive in this new normal?\u201d And we fundamentally think this combination is that operating system for growth for every company in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derrick Wood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. I wanted to touch on the operational plans for on-boarding Slack. Maybe, you know, could you compare and contrast the strategy to integrate Slack versus what you've done with Tableau or MuleSoft? And then Mark Hawkins, you know, thanks for the EPS guidance, but I know there's a lot of below the operating income line factors. So, can you give us any goalposts around how to think about how Slack impacts operating margins, and how to think about margins next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hawkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'm happy to take the operating margin discussion, and perhaps Bret, you may want to talk about the operating plan integration. I'm happy to chip in there as well, if that\u2019s helpful. Derrick, first of all thank you for the question. We are going to be factoring in Slack\u2019s business profile into our overall business for next year for the operating margin. We'll give the operating margin and the cash flow growth for the entire company for normal tradition in Q4 call, for sure. You can see because it's a public company, it\u2019s profile is different than Salesforce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It'll be dilutive to our operating margin in aggregate. And there'll be the purchase accounting side of it, but we\u2019ll give you very specifics in Q4 there Derrick. Not only on the operating margin, but the cash flow, and then even the latest on the revenue growth in Q4. On the integration plan, Bret, I don't know if you want to touch on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bret Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I'm happy to take this Mark as you said. You know, I think our philosophy is very similar to our philosophy with MuleSoft and Tableau, which is number one, starting with our mutual customers and starting for, how can we, you know, help every one of our customers benefit from the combination of these two technologies, without really recognizing that Slack, you know, fundamentally, if you look at the happiest customers who use Slack, it is really the central nervous system for their company. And that's really connecting every single application at their company, not just applications from Salesforce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that really means bounce in making sure you know, Slack has an independent brand and continues to serve every single company and integrates with every single system as your company, while also making sure that it really achieves the vision that Mark talked about, which is, it really becomes sort of the user interface to the Customer 360. It helps all of our customers be successful as they try to create a single source of truth for the customer data. I'm really happy with this strategy. It's really been effective with our integration with companies like MuleSoft and Tableau that have continued to thrive. And, you know, continue to be technology agnostic, while also becoming really integrated part of our value proposition to our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you so much for taking the question and congratulations, Mark Hawkins. It's been great working with you over the years. And for Marc Benioff, I mean, Salesforce and Slack together, it seems like this is going to become the hub that connects all of the different Salesforce applications together and offers even more value for your customers. How do you see \u2013 in the context of the 90% customer overlap you mentioned, how do you see this evolving the digital transformation messages to customers that you're already sharing? And I guess the other piece is, when you think about the pieces of the Salesforce puzzle, if you will, would you say despite your efforts with chatter that this was one of the biggest remaining pieces you were missing? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I mean, I'll start with the end, which is, there's no doubt that Slack just has an incredible approach to collaboration in a way that we really could never have imagined, especially in regards to the integrations and applications in the ecosystem that are built on top of it. Certainly, like chatter to have the collaborative interface and we\u2019ll benefit from that because we've done such deep work in our own architecture around our Chatter API and some of the other key parts of our core system. But when you look at what happens when you put Slack and Salesforce together, you know the fundamental experience for the customer, it just changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of course, you're already doing wall-to-wall in the enterprise, which is very exciting for Salesforce is beyond just sales or service or marketing. It's into every department. We've already seen a lot of that with Tableau and the ability for Tableau to go wall-to-wall and you know Tableau is another product that users just love Tableau, users just love Slack, when we start to bring our Customer 360 into that, our ability to build applications with lightning, our ability to light up our own workflow, and build workflows to our customers and expose those through these channels, well that's where the fundamental expression of Salesforce and how it looks, whether it's on a phone or an iPad, or on your desktop, it's, you know, deeply modernizes it. And Brett, would you like to fill that in?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bret Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, you know, you know, Marc, when I think about the opportunity for our customers, I just \u2013 every single customer engagement I've been involved with could benefit from this capability. You know this past quarter, one of the customers I had the privilege of working with is Ferguson, which is the largest wholesale distributor of commercial and residential plumbing suppliers. And this is a classic Customer 360 relationship where their CEO, Kevin Murphy and their CIO, Mike Sajor were really trying to connect everything from B2B and B2C commerce to customer service to their platform. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when I think about the vision of that, you know that company and I think about the opportunity to come into these, you know, these companies going through this digital transformation and trying to really say, how do we build the perfect digitally augmented experience and customers, this is the ultimate system of engagement. This is the ultimate way you can connect every employee, the ultimate way you can work with your B2B partners most of that way that you can transform your teams working on, you know B2C customer engagement. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And, you know, I think that's when we look at the opportunity for our customers. So, we look at the opportunity for Slack customers. We really think that bringing these things together gives us such a complete value proposition. I think it's really exciting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. For Mark Hawkins, just on the billion for the quarter, there were some question marks just as it relates to the deceleration, and I'm curious if there was anything behind the scenes that we should be aware of? We know, you had a difficult comp and you're coming into a seasonally strong quarter, anything to call out there on the billings number? Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hawkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Brent, first of all, thank you for the question. And, you know, nothing, you know, first of all, we don't really \u2013 billings is not a metric that we focus a lot on. We think CRPO helps us a bit more in terms of actually managing the business and that\u2019s a metric that we track carefully. We feel like this just makes sense, it\u2019s consistent with the revenue guidance for next year. And obviously in prior quarter, we lapped Tableau, but where we feel really good about this number, we feel great about the demand environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously, that\u2019s why we raised again the revenue for the year and we initiated a \u2014 I think, a really appropriate guide for next year\u2019s revenue. Not very many companies do five quarters in advance, so we feel good about the demand environment, but we just think this is consistent with all of that and look forward to executing on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hawkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You bet, Brent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. And Mark Hawkins it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. Congratulations on the retirement. I wanted to ask on the Slack acquisition, really a two-part question. On the front end, maybe for Bret, can you talk to us about what you guys can do with Slack by owning it versus partnering? Because I think one of the things that has Slack differentiates which is \u2013 they\u2019re open integration is the fact that they integrate with everybody. So why is it necessary to own the asset? And then on the back side, I wanted to ask just about the price tag. On the last conference call, Mr. Benioff, you talked about it being a tough environment for M&amp;A for stuff being expensive and you\u2019re making hard to make these acquisitions financially work out for you guys. What is it about this one, like how do you garner the confidence at this $28 billion price tag? Is the right price tag and financially this is going to make sense for our Salesforce over time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bret Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you for your question. I\u2019ll start on the \u2013 just talking a little bit about why it\u2019s important and why it\u2019s valuable for our customers for this to be a part of our portfolio. The journey that we\u2019ve been on over the past decade is really going from a company with a single value proposition around sales automation, so really \u2013 it\u2019s vision for Customer 360. They can connect sales, service, marketing, e-commerce, analytics platform. And when you look at all of our largest deals, our happiest customers, our healthiest customers with lowest attrition, they\u2019re not just using one of our products, they are really using this entire platform to get the single source of truth for their customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we see this incredible vision as Marc said, it\u2019s been something we\u2019ve been working at and thinking about for a long time, well before I even joined this company about how do you connect all of these experiences? How do you actually create a seamless customer experience team, customer service and marketing, which every single retailer in the world was worried about this past weekend? How [do B2B] companies?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I\u2019m really focused on not just selling, but customer success, which is really connecting the entire Customer 360. And when we talked about Slack really becoming and the user interface for the Customer 360, this is what we mean. I really think this is a way of delivering that vision to our customers and for them to deliver \u2013 our customers to deliver a vision to their partners and their customers through technologies like Slack Connect is really, really meaningful and really, really unique. And I think it captures candidly the new way that most of our customers think about their customer relationships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not siloed by department anymore. It\u2019s really end-to-end journey and to really achieve that we think that Slack is a tool that facilitates that in a really unique way and really help accelerate our customers, who are going through this transformation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Marc I\u2019m not sure if you want to comment a bit on your comments from last earnings call just to offer my perspective. We\u2019ve been clear consistently that when we look at our M&amp;A strategy and our inorganic acquisition strategy, it\u2019s fundamentally, we have to be opportunistic. We have to make sure that we respond to unique conditions from our customers in the market. And this year, if anything else, it\u2019s been hard to predict and this is an opportunity that we saw as we\u2019ve talked a lot about this shift in the economy, the relevance of Slack to our customer base that has obviously dramatically increased over the course of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I do think that we \u2013 the market is very unusual this year, but we have to make sure that we as a company a beginner\u2019s mind about where innovation can come from and recognize that we have to take timing what is available to us as we evaluate these inorganic opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would like to address that which is that, I think what\u2019s very exciting is, this vision that Stuart and Bret have put together. And I think that when I look back in the [indiscernible], I don\u2019t think I could have ever imagine any acquisitions happening this year or in this pandemic or in this all digital environment, we are just, kind of, grout forcing it right through where we\u2019re making as many sales calls as we can and we\u2019re collaborating very deeply as a company and all of a sudden Bret and Stuart coming together and say, yes, we can do this. And when we look at the result in vision, it\u2019s a wow. It\u2019s like something that we could have never imagined. And when we look at acquisitions today, we do have a little bit of a swagger, of course we\u2019ve done probably over 60 deals, small, medium, and very large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the whole, our transactions have been extremely successful. And when we look at our very large transactions especially ExactTarget, Tableau we look at how or what we\u2019ve learned our ability to integrate companies to make one plus one equals three. We look at this and we say, wow, this is a game changer and we know how to pull it off. And we have a lot of our former executives for example at Slack already. So, we know a lot of those players. We work so deeply with the company both in a business development perspective, but just because they are our neighbor and we\u2019re like, oh boy, the value that we can bring to customers is much stronger as one company than is two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when you look at the difference in partnering versus owning it really means that we\u2019re able to do things with our technology that we just could not do as partners and that\u2019s the demos, the visions that Bret and Stuart had put together and look, when they presented this to me, I was sold and I am sold and I can\u2019t wait to get out on the road and present it to customers because I know that they are going to be absolutely blown away about what this looks like for them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. And mine, maybe just for Marc and for Gavin. I want to ask about the demand environment, particularly how it looks from a pipeline perspective for the fourth quarter. And Marc and Gavin, how are you seeing the priorities change through this pandemic. How do you think about that for next year as you look at the opportunity to solve these pain points. And Marc, I guess the other follow-up to Keith\u2019s question is why now on Slack, why not before and why not next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it\u2019s a good question. And let me kind of \u2013 I\u2019ll tell you in two stories, but the first story is, we started out this year. I think everyone remembers we went through a very dramatic transformation in our management team. Keith decided to retire, which I fully supported and we knew that we were going to go through a big shift in distribution strategy. Our team members themselves and what we didn\u2019t have written in the back was the global pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, all of a sudden in the first quarter, what was happening at Salesforce was distribution transformation and global pandemic and that shook our confidence. You might remember that, I also said pipelines appear to be really strong. So, even though in the middle of the quarter we went into global lock down in March and April, we think we\u2019re going to come out pretty strong and we were very fortunate starting in the second quarter with number one, on-boarding a fantastic new CRO, Gavin Patterson, former Chief Executive Officer, VP, who was working with us, who I\u2019ve known for so many years and coming in as our CRO and our President, taking his position, which he was doing so much with us already, but then really leading our global distribution operation and then we rebuilt our entire distribution management team as part of that, and we delivered the second quarter, which was our record quarter, we had phenomenal bookings, margins, revenues, cash flow across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the second quarter turned to third quarter, we are happy to talk about an unbelievable quarter. I mean, it was just remarkable, the performance of the company. I would never have imagined it \u2013 us in February and March when this started. Now, I\u2019m like, wow, it gave me a lot more confidence in where we\u2019re going, Now when we look at the fourth quarter, which pipelines, we have tremendous outlooks and we feel very good about our ability to succeed, you know, with [indiscernible] architect with Dreamforce. That\u2019s going incredibly well and we look at next year and we\u2019re like wow we\u2019ve never been more competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve never been able to succeed more aggressively with our customers. We have solutions that are not only horizontal, but vertical. We\u2019re strong in every one of our key categories from sales to service, to marketing, to commerce, to platform, to analytics, to integration, we\u2019re able to deliver tremendous value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When I look at what we\u2019ve done with key customers and I mentioned AT&amp;T in the last call. So, when I look at what we\u2019ve done with their management team, with their competitiveness, with the results that they\u2019re getting, it just gives us a lot of, I would say, a gratitude in our ability to transform a company like that or any company and world \u2013 and we do it worldwide. And then when we bring in Slack, well, you know with these acquisitions, you never know exactly when they\u2019re going to happen and we couldn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t know when Tableau was going to happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of course, we always loved Adam and Christian before that, we didn\u2019t know when ExactTarget was going to happen, we always loved Scott and we didn\u2019t know when Stewart and Slack would happen, and when the moment \u2013 and the opportunity arises you have to look and ask yourself, are you strong? Can you do something like this or are you weak, or is it a moment where you just don\u2019t have the swagger? And let\u2019s face it, look at these numbers, so we just delivered Salesforce has never been stronger, never been more capable, it\u2019s never had a more competitive position, it\u2019s never been able to execute more acuity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look at the IDC numbers, I don\u2019t have to go through them in sales and service and marketing across the board. They\u2019re very, very impressive and when we\u2019ve gone up against tough competitors we have done just fine, and I think that we bring a lot of value to Slack right now at their size, as you know they\u2019re going basically entering from the $1 billion to $2 billion phase, which I know extremely well and this is a moment where we can offer a lot of value. We\u2019ve been there, we\u2019ve lived that life, and we\u2019re going to come in and we\u2019re going to help them not just be successful doing it, we\u2019re going to help them to just redefine the entire industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that dream and that vision that Bret and Stuart have is really unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen of any company or any product anywhere and when you see it all laid out you will just be blown away. I mean, I was and I have a lot of confidence that you will be as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gavin Patterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And perhaps I should just add some comments as well, Marc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please do Gavin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gavin Patterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, what we saw in Q3 was a continuation of the strong demand that we saw in Q2 and it\u2019s a very well-rounded performance across all the clouds and both in the U.S. and internationally we\u2019ve seen strong demand around the world. And as we look into Q4 beyond, the pipeline continues to be very encouraging. So, I guess what I\u2019m saying and you\u2019ve heard it from Bret and Marc, as well is that I think the core of what we offer to be the trusted advisor for digital transformation. This is an imperative to every company and every organization in the U.S. and around the world and that conversation has become more urgent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re finding that we\u2019re getting very, very good access probably at least twice the access to decision makers, who want to have that conversation and want to get on and make that transformation and users in their departments. So the businesses I think are in really good shape. We\u2019re confident going into next year. And as Marc says, I think Slack really rounds out that proposition. And I think it\u2019s going to \u2013 and we feel very encouraged and very optimistic about maintaining this performance going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gavin, I want to ask you a question, because I think it\u2019s appropriate. Look you\u2019ve been running this business now \u2013 so well now for several quarters, but just give us one more level of insight, what has been your greatest surprise, look you are \u2013 we\u2019ve been friends a long time, you are a customer, you\u2019ve been a partner, you\u2019ve known a lot of our executives, now you\u2019re deep inside the machine, what has been your biggest surprise working inside Salesforce and now working with our customers and doing these huge transactions that you\u2019ve been doing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gavin Patterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well. As you said, I\u2019ve been a customer and I sure tell you what Salesforce could do for my business, and I thought we were reasonably excited about it, but it hasn\u2019t been until I came into the company. It wasn\u2019t until I came into the company and I realized that actually there\u2019s so much more you can get if you align your complete business behind the Salesforce CRM system and the wider set of clouds. That\u2019s probably the single most important thing I\u2019ve learnt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The share potential of getting to a single source of truth, operating the Customer 360 and I see so much more potential in customers, who really embrace that vision and some guess get it today and we\u2019ve got some great case studies demonstrate that, but others still have that opportunity. I think going forward. So, there\u2019s plenty of potential left in the business on all the clouds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019d say the second thing I\u2019d call out is, actually how great very big company, how agile the business is, and how we\u2019ve been able to maintain the agility and grip of a small company, while managing to cut it to $24 billion or $21-plus billion in sales and 25% CAGR a year. It is quite remarkable. The decisions can be taken quickly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We can respond to changing customer needs and that is being critical, because I think if I look back over these last six months, making sure that we remain relevant to our customers, and so that we can help them through these difficult times, make sure that we\u2019re there to guide them and help types of transformation, but demonstrate we\u2019re able to listen and respond in terms of the propositions we offer. I mean, it\u2019s been I think quite remarkable. So, it has been quite a ride and certainly been a privilege to be a part of it and I think there\u2019s a long way still to go and another few chapters for the next book in it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marc Benioff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think that we can say now with delivering this guidance of [21.1] and looking at next year as well, Gavin, I just want to thank you, because I don\u2019t think there is a more successful sales executive in enterprise software certainly at the size and scale that we\u2019re operating in than you are and your leverage, your experience as a Chief Executive Officer is a very large 100,000 person company [BT]. I mean, you\u2019ve done a phenomenal job. So, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gavin Patterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for questions. I will turn the call back over to Evan for closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Evan Goldstein</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for joining us on the call today.
