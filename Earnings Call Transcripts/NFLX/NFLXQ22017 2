I\u2019m David Wells, CFO. I\u2019m joined today on the company side by Reed Hastings, our CEO; and Ted Sarandos, our Chief Content Officer.</p> <p>Interviewing us today will be Doug Mitchelson from UBS. We\u2019re going to try something a little different and have one interviewer just for a little bit more continuity. Then I think Doug will have our first question being our only interviewer. </p> <p>Before we get started, we will be making forward-looking statements, so actual results may vary.</p> <p>Doug, over to you for our first question.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p><strong>Q - Doug Mitchelson</strong></p> <p>Thanks so much, David. I wanted to start simply by asking if there is anything notable in the quarter? For you, Reed, you talked about Netflix being a learning machine. Anything that you\u2019ve learned that you want to share with us from the past three months?</p> <p><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p>I mean anything notable beyond 5 million net adds in Q2; all-time record for Q2s, up sequentially from Q1,do you mean notable beyond that. I think we\u2019re just seeing that the rewards of doing great content focused on the quality of the service are paying off.</p> <p><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p>I think I\u2019ll run through some of the quotes that you guys have on the letter this quarter, and one of first things that caught my eye was \u201cDue to our amazing content,\u201d so Ted did you put that word amazing in there, any update you can give us on thoughts around how content influenced the quarter?</p> <p><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p>I think it was the<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> combination of a lot of great things. 13 Reasons Why, started right at the end of the quarter, rolled into some of our biggest content brands; new seasons of House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black; ending the quarter with Okja. So just I think it was the combination of a lot of different things, kind of<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> a reinforcement that as long as we are programming to a wide variety of tastes and keep the quality level high that we can turn some success off of that.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think congratulations on all the Emmy nominations to the company and to you specifically, Ted [indiscernible].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. That\u2019s definitely a team effort beyond my own content team, the marketing and PR groups and everyone who kind of makes that happen. It\u2019s hard to forget that it is a race, so it\u2019s a big campaign that attaches to that stuff too, but 91 nominations is an all-time record for us and we\u2019re thrilled.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continuing on the letter a little bit, David, for you. You note that our 3Q guidance assumes much of your Q2 momentum will continue. You say you\u2019re cognizant of the lessons in the prior quarters where you forecasted lumpiness in net adds. So should we take this to mean that the third quarter includes that you\u2019re cognizant of prior quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think back to your earlier question about what lessons into the last 90 days have held for us and one of them is our business is a little bit tough to predict given the success of content and the popularity of content. We still think the major driver is adoption of Internet television. But on top of that we\u2019re increasingly growing throughout the world, so we\u2019re getting more word of mouth on our newer territories and we\u2019re seeing great content slates have an effect like they did in the second quarter. So I think you can take that line to mean that our forward guidance assumes continued good trends and continued great trends. But we\u2019re a little bit cognizant of other quarters where we\u2019ve either under or over forecasted because some of that demand was pulled forward by a great content slate. In this case, in the second quarter we had a really strong content slate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And continuing on with you, David, at some point ahead of expectations when you talked in the letter about margins being on track for full year 7%, would that suggest that with subs, and therefore likely the revenue coming better than expected, you\u2019re choosing to invest more and maintain that margin target?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So we had a 9% margin in the first quarter and we had a lot of content come on in this quarter, so we got it down to 5%. So on the first six months, we\u2019re running right on our target of 7% and our guide is right on 7%. So you can take from that that we\u2019re going to reinvest and plough back in the business sort of any over forecasted growth that we have on the top line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And David, one more for you. You call un-grandfathering impact in the fourth quarter, I think you had some price increase sort of \u2013 perhaps that was back in Q2, and I am un-grandfathering again in 4Q, is there any sizing you can give investors around the pricing strategy issues that impacted, specifically specifically 3Q, but the year as well if you're --??</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think last year what we found was because of the PR and the news around the price change in the second quarter, which actually didn\u2019t happen or un-grandfathering until the third and fourth quarter, we had a real blended effect through the year. So it\u2019s hard to tease out exactly which quarter we saw effects on both acquisition or retention. We do know that the comping off of last year we think we\u2019ll have less noise this year, I think that\u2019s pretty clear. So I would say it was a median in terms of size and impact on the business from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over to Reed. Reed, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d tell me based on the results you just reported, you did well anywhere, but particularly it looks like Europe is really getting critical mass, and every country in Europe is different. So I thought I\u2019d sort of try to screen [ph] on Germany as an example, and particularly I think Germany is sort of a tough market for the U.S. companies, consumers over there don\u2019t like to pay for TV, they don\u2019t watch as much TV. Obviously, English is not their local language. Amazon was there first as well, so there\u2019s a competitive dynamic. Based it looks \u2013 based on our tracking, you are actually surpassing Amazon, at least with app downloads if not subs, is that -- are you at the point where you are taking the leadership in Germany \u2013 can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019ve done right and what you\u2019re doing right that has caused that market to be able to develop?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, Amazon is super successful around the world if you look at U.S. with Prime, incredibly successful. It just doesn\u2019t seem to take away from us, so I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as us versus Amazon in Germany. I would really characterize it as can we have a service that\u2019s so great that Germans find it worthwhile paying for. And clearly we\u2019re succeeding at that making our service better and better. In particular, there\u2019s no advertisements on Netflix, and so it\u2019s great for kids, it\u2019s great for teens. And then the great content is so significant in helping the growth that you\u2019re picking up. But as you suggested, we\u2019re really seeing that around the world, whether it\u2019s Brazil or Argentina or Japan, Singapore, or Germany, Internet TV is really catching on for us, for YouTube, for others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess what I\u2019m trying to get to, Reed, is you launch two and a half years ago, and I think when you launched, you grew parallel to Latin America and that it will take some time, but you\u2019d figure the markets in Europe out and eventually you\u2019re going to have similar levels of success. Do those parallels still hold, and can we look forward to the Europe where there is fits and starts in terms of progress? but if you really hit the point where you reach escape velocity, do you think those markets to be strong markets going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think all throughout the West; so Latin America, North America, and Europe, we\u2019re doing very well. We just got to continue what we\u2019re doing, more local productions. We\u2019ve got some amazing new shows we\u2019re producing in Europe and in Latin America. With Asia, we\u2019ve got a lot more to learn. We\u2019re really expanding a lot in India, Japan. We\u2019re figuring it out market by market. But Asia is very unique and very large. So we see a huge opportunity for us over the next couple of years, all of us spending more time there and investing more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Reed, continuing along that line because Asia is so diverse and and you think about Korea, Japan, Thailand, India, they\u2019re all very different markets. How do you prioritize your investments in Asia?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We look at market size, we look at growth of Internet, kind of all the factors that we\u2019ve always looked at around the world. And so then we\u2019re able to prioritize in what we\u2019re doing. And we saw some great success, for example, this quarter with Okja. And maybe, Ted, you want to describe a little bit on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Okja is directed by Bong Joon-Ho who is the most celebrated director in Korea and is a huge star and an attraction in and of himself, but also the movie itself is one of the most ambitious productions in history of Korea. His films tend to travel around the world pretty well. It made a ton of noise at the Cannes Film Festival. It was the most talked about film at the festival. So it helped in attracting new subscribers also, but it also brings a brand halo to Netflix that it\u2019s a place for great content worth paying for. And I think we saw some of that benefit throughout Europe and in pockets of Asia where we saw big sign-ups in Korea, but remember for most people, they\u2019ve learned about Netflix for the first time when Okja was coming out in Korea. So relative to the rest of the world, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do. But it was a great introduction to Netflix for a lot of the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so in carrying that forward that Reed just mentioned, more local content particularly in --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and even more so Doug, think about local content for global audiences. So the idea \u2013 that\u2019s a fantastic story that we make a Korean movie for Korea, but it\u2019s even a bigger story that the movie is getting watched by millions all around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Ted, can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re expanding [indiscernible] target overseas, the size of the team and is there capacity growth, is there growth in percentage of budget being allocated to --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, as Reed mentioned, matching the program into local taste is really the key and we\u2019ve seen it in our expansion through Latin America, our expansion into Europe. And as we look to Asia, we have to get better and better matching those tastes. And those tastes are not as easily aligned with Western tastes. So we\u2019ll invest more time and energy in Asia putting some people on the ground in Asia that we haven\u2019t historically, but well within how we\u2019ve looked at the size of the teams generally but locating them more likely outside of the U.S. as we continue to grow for local audiences in Asia and throughout the rest of Europe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, just to round out Ted\u2019s answer, all those things that you mentioned are involved in that. So it\u2019s growth of the acquisition and development teams, it\u2019s also budget. We already had in place growth in budget in many of these territories who\u2019s just trying to deploy that more efficiently. In some cases, it\u2019s adding on to the levels of investment. You ask about how we prioritize? Generally, when we see success, we try to add on to that until we reach a point of diminishing returns. And so, if we\u2019re going to see success in some markets, we may up the content budget in those markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It all makes sense. Reed, over to you, since I think we are on Asia, if you think about emerging markets broadly, there\u2019s certainly a lot of mobile. And I\u2019m curious if you can give us an update on the implication for strategy and efforts that you have underway, and if you could talk about the --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely, Doug. We\u2019ve had great success on mobile in the developed markets like the U.S. and Europe and then throughout Latin America, and now and Asia. And all of the Netflix service works extremely well on mobile. We\u2019re continuing to get better and better at encoding efficiently our films and TV series so that it takes less and less network bandwidth and we\u2019re rising in popularity around the world, and that\u2019s paralleling the improvements that YouTube and others are doing to make video a natural part of mobile phones, and so that\u2019s just a continued evolution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Are mobile Netflix products a different product than we\u2019re used to right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, mobile\u2019s just a 4- or 5-inch screen for us with a great touch interface, and it\u2019s very similar to what you see on an iPad to the television. So think of it as there\u2019s just many screens that you can enjoy Netflix on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When I think about [indiscernible]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m afraid, Doug, I can\u2019t hear you anymore. There seems to be some AV problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you hear me now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Barely. You may need to shout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So for Reed or David, as you consider emerging markets again broadly, is there a capacity to mass market the product without having the need to lower price point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll see. We\u2019ve been very successful getting to beginnings of a mass model product in Latin America where you\u2019ve got a lot of fairly developed economies. We\u2019ll see in Asia what we can do with that. But for the first couple years, it\u2019s focused on more high-end, Western-oriented elites. And then as we grow into that, we can think about expanding beyond that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ted, back over to you. At the beginning of the year, you talked about having a strong second half content slate. Do you feel that the content slate is settling now to where you thought, and and there is a strong second half --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is there any way you can see what the --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s a lot to be really excited about in the second half in terms of our content releases. Starting as early as next week, we have a great show called Ozark starring Jason Bateman that we\u2019re really excited to launch. And then in August, we have the release of Death Note, a great new film that we\u2019re going to panel at Comic-Con this next. And also in August, The Defenders, which brings together all of the characters from Marvel\u2019s Defenders; Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, and Iron Fist for an incredible season that people are really excited about. And of course throughout the year, we have things that will lead up to Bright at the end of the year which is a huge film with Will Smith that will be only available on Netflix that we\u2019re incredibly excited about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ted, what do you think Reed means when he says he wants you to be able to cancel more shows?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, I think I mentioned before that in this universe we look at a lot of things like failure is not such a bad thing and if you\u2019re not failing maybe you\u2019re not trying hard enough. So when we have a good hit rate and even with the recent cancelations, 93% of our shows have been renewed. So you want to be introspective and look at that and say, are we being adventurous enough, Daredevil, we\u2019re trying new things. And I think when you think of things \u2013 when you have a very high hit ratio, you definitely want to keep second guessing yourself even though you do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">David, when we think about potential for more and more original shows being produced, therefore, likely more and more cancelations over time, any impact on the financials that we should think about? And separately and importantly, is the viewing that you are expecting, whether it\u2019s license content or original content, whether it\u2019s movies that you are putting out consistent with the amortization schedule that you have in place?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and I think what you\u2019ve raised is a good point which is the more shows we add, the more likely in absolute numbers that you\u2019ll see cancelations of course. But that\u2019s only novel Netflix and it\u2019s still novel because you see on network television about two-thirds \u2013 about a third of the content gets cut in the first season versus our content which is mostly renewed. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re less careful about it, it\u2019s because we can more efficiently build it and not a 100% of the time. So we want to launch shows. We love when there\u2019s a deep passion fan base for a show. We just need it to be big enough to support the economics of that show so we don\u2019t create opportunity cost for future fans of new shows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, just to take the sort of accounting oriented part of that question, I would say no. We don\u2019t anticipate right now. We look at this constantly. Every quarter, we look at the trends. Many of these shows, even if they\u2019re not picked up for a renewal, they may have a story arc that completes the narrative. And so, it really is for us is about the sort of continuity of viewing over the life of the show. So even if some of that viewing is concentrated as our amortization methodology reflects upfront in the sort of first release, the first month of release of that content on the site, it may have sort of steady viewing over the life. And if it does, then it\u2019s going to be sort of reflective of those trends. If it\u2019s really concentrated, then yes sure we would have to reflect that. But many of the non renewals get wrapped up. Bloodline is an example, something that we got wrapped up in a narrative. We\u2019re going to do a movie wrap up on Sense8. And so I think overall, you\u2019ll see us try to wrap the narratives on these.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I have some questions on content. I wanted to set it up Reed with a question for you. In the past, we\u2019ve gotten parallels between Netflix and HBO, and that implies Netflix is a TV network. I think even the letter this quarter, it talked about that, TV network [indiscernible] At the same time, you've expanded to the unscripted movies, original TV, and is Netflix instead more of a Comcast-type version of Internet TV or should we think about it as an Internet-TV network?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think about it more like a super network. We\u2019re talking about addressing content desires and needs across the board, as you mentioned unscripted, but also kids and films. This year, the Emmy is just as an example. We have five different series nominated for Best Comedy or Drama. We also have two documentary series nominated for Best Documentary Series, two documentary films nominated for Best Documentary Films. We won 10 daytime Emmys for our kids programming. So we are doing across the board programming, not programming for one niche which networks tend to do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then for Reed, just a question on content spending, how do you decide how much you allow [indiscernible] \u2013 how do we measure sort of aggregate value the customers want any one piece of content becoming less and less important as you grow your body of original content?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, every piece of content that we do is important, and we try to have that content flourish around the world, but in terms of the overall investment levels, we\u2019re continuing to see increased median viewing compared to a year ago, two years ago, three years ago as we\u2019re winning a few more of the moments of truth of what you do to relax. But still we\u2019re such a small player in our viewing compared to linear TV, compared to YouTube. So we\u2019ve got a long way to go to have more and more content to please more and more members and continue to grow. And what you see us doing as we grow is also improving our margins, so we\u2019re getting some efficiency out of that as opposed to spending every dollar in the content. But we are growing the content budget significantly also because of the opportunity that we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ted, back to you in terms of strategy for how you\u2019re producing content. When you think about the fact that Netflix now can self produce titles, you can license exclusive originals from Hollywood Studios, you can license third-party \u2013 you can license reruns, where do you see the race will turn at this point in time, and how do you see others responding to your strategy of self producing a few shows?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The success we\u2019ve had with our self produced shows has given us a lot more confidence to expand it. Because we\u2019re a global network, those rights are really important in terms of being able to control our destiny, when we can make shows available, and what formats to make them available. And beyond that, there\u2019s an economic tradeoff which is there\u2019s a big studio margin that we\u2019re able to put on the screen and make better shows when we produce it ourselves. So a show like Stranger Things, when it becomes a big cultural phenomena, we\u2019d like to be able to control the destiny of those brands as we continue to invest in them. But at the same time we want to lean on putting the best programming possible on the air. So not being dogmatic about which shows we pick depending on their business model but being really careful about picking shows that are great regardless of their business model, but you\u2019ll see us do a lot more of self producing whenever we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so last question in the series on content, Ted, I\u2019ll probably end up asking this every quarter forever. But any issues on \u2013 with your positive content for access to the best shows with more and more players, obviously Apple hired two Sony executives; Facebook announced they\u2019re buying some original content, others continue to expand. You\u2019re certainly competing very well and the Emmys are sort of proof of the quality of content. But on the margin, do you cost-wise, more than you would like, some projects go to others that you prefer you have yourself?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think Internet television is an enormous space and there\u2019s going to be lots of competition. And as they come in, they\u2019re going to bid up the cost of the best stuff which is great. It\u2019s great for consumers, because more things get made. And it\u2019s great for creators because they\u2019re more buyers at the table. So we expect the content cost to go up on the top premium things, but I think, as I said, I think that\u2019s a good result for everybody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that of course brings in new capacity like you saw Headlines Today that Liberty Global and TPG were forming a new television studio to produce shows for all this new market. So as the prices go up, there\u2019s more capacity because there\u2019s very large numbers of writers out there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the letter, it talks pretty exclusively about expanding distribution relationships whether it is a content provider, it\u2019s a pay-per-view provider, bundling in Netflix service and I guess two questions there. Reed, for you first. What about the reverse? Do you see Netflix as a platform that can bundle other video services and sell that on profit and make a margin. And second as part of that, any specifics behind the point made in the letter that you expect to really expand these efforts?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are several companies who are selling networks on top of their platform. So Hulu is doing that, Amazon is doing that. We don\u2019t see that as a business direction for us. We\u2019re really focused on making our network as great as it possibly can be. And then as you point out, we\u2019re now looking at proposals for including Netflix and some services and beginning to learn the bundling part of the business. We\u2019re doing a little bit of that in Europe already and it\u2019s been quite successful. Thus we\u2019re interested in expanding that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And shifting over to David and ASP. I think in the past you\u2019ve talked about mid-single digit being a good aspirational point to consider. And when you look at the tiers that you have, it seems like the base tier is relatively high in place to the middle tier and the upper tier. I wanted to deal with that into -- are there other ways to differentiate those tiers to create more value and have that be an even bigger part of ASP growth in the future?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, I\u2019m not sure I heard the first part of your question on ASP, so just repeat that first part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So for ASPs, I think in the past you have said that mid-single digit growth longer term is the right way for investors to think about Netflix\u2019s pricing potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s correct. So if you\u2019re just looking for clarity there, yes. That\u2019s an easy answer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when we think about the tiers that you currently have in place, the midsized tier and the higher price tier feel like they\u2019re relatively close in price to the base tier. Is there other ways that you\u2019re considering to add value to the higher-priced tiers to have tiering up be an increasing part of that ASP growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t think so. Right now, I would say we do see success with people taking the upper tier with just the differentiation of concurrent streams and high definition. We don\u2019t think necessarily that we need to add more value. We have the flexibility to add more value in terms of that tier differentiation. But honestly, we think there\u2019s progressive growth just from thinking about differentiating those tiers on price point a little more in terms of middle and upper. And then in terms of an expectation of ASP growth, that\u2019s reasonable in terms of what you outlined. We are lapping the un-grandfathering of last year, so you are seeing sort of revenue on a year-over-year basis or ASP on a year-over-year basis start to reflect that lapping of a large pool of un-grandfathers coming on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, we\u2019re super proud that we\u2019ve been able to maintain this $8 access point in the U.S. or \u20ac8 in Europe which we\u2019ve had in place since 2010. So all of this decade, Netflix has been available for $8. And when you think about that content increase over the last seven years, it\u2019s phenomenal and it\u2019s still $8 a month at the base level. And we\u2019re getting the ASP growth as people optionally select to get HD and ultra-HD which are amazing new formats that have come on, but again a key part of the successful strategy is that we\u2019re staying very, very affordable for people.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s interesting because you mentioned sort of growth in content and the service, Reed, and you mentioned that the median time spent has been increasing. Are newer customers that are coming on the service this year behaving similar to new customers two years ago or four years ago or --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similar and better. They\u2019re watching more. More engaged. Again, that\u2019s a combination of the user interface, the algorithms, or the personalization and of course the content itself. And so it\u2019s very exciting that we\u2019ve been able to see even higher engagement with members now compared to last year and the prior years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">David, I wanted to circle back on churn. You talked about the un-grandfathering churn. I\u2019m just curious if you could sort of help investors understand how churn has evolved over time? And do you see meaningful opportunities to improve churn from here and what specifically those opportunities might be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we generally talk about net additions just because of fluidity of somebody coming back on the service. It\u2019s hard to parse the two pieces. I\u2019ve made comments in the past that generally year-over-year, churn has improved as we improve the service, as we add more content, as subscribers age up. But more and more as our word of mouth and as we penetrate close to 50% in the U.S. today, those lines are fairly indistinct in terms of user rejoin or not and somebody may have been a member of the service 12, 14, 18 months ago. So I would say in answering the spirit of the question, we continue to improve the quality of the service with more content, with a better interface, all the things that Reed just talked about in terms of driving value to the middle and upper tier to have people chose and electively chose a more robust service. I\u2019d say that continues. And then outside the U.S. as we age, we usually \u2013 the pattern there is to improve the quality of the library, we better match the taste and that includes both Western content for that local audience and a little bit of local content as well that Ted talked about earlier, so we expect to improve churn outside the U.S. as we get better and better in these markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sticking with you, David, on the margin side, you\u2019ve in the last letter and this letter have talked about a 7% margin target this year and modest expansion thereafter, care to help investors out at all in terms of understanding what that pace of margin expansion might be relatively to investment opportunities that you have?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re focused on making the 7% this year. We know that we\u2019ll clarify that towards October. But we want to balance both growth of the business and reinvestment back in the business given that we\u2019re seeing some great returns on that content given the growth that we experienced this last quarter with sort of a disciplined growth of profit. We also know that you can\u2019t just hockey stick it in three to five years and expect the business to be in the right place. So I think it\u2019s a bit of a balance and right now that 7% with sort of consistent and deliberate growth after that is the right guidance for our investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, if you remember last year, we were at 4%. So you might be able to apply something there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Reed. I appreciate that. What would be helpful as well sort of reading the details a little bit out of David is can you frame a margin progression in terms of where the leverage comes in the cost structure? Is it content side, the marketing side, G&amp;A, tech and dev? Where should we see the most leverage in the cost structure over time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, to-date, it\u2019s really just been about as we expand globally and people watch a lot of the same content, Ted talked about the cost pressures in terms of as more people pile in at the top end of the market on the unit cost of content costs, but we\u2019ve been able to grow even faster than that. So we\u2019re able to expand both our content spending and our margin at the same time because we\u2019re growing faster than that content. And we expect that to continue forward for the foreseeable future. We are leveraging marketing. We\u2019re spending more on an absolute basis on marketing as we become more and more of a media company. But on a percent of revenue basis, we\u2019re leveraging there. And G&amp;A and tech and dev has kind of run a little bit in line with revenue as we expand internationally and as we become more of a full-fledged studio and a bigger, and at-scale studio. So it\u2019s pressured there in terms of adding people, but I do anticipate the ability to leverage some of that down the road.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The cash flow burn is certainly an interesting comment, and you mentioned it last quarter in the letter, you mentioned it this quarter in the letter. I think similar to margins, investors are trying to read between the lines, understand how free cash flow burn might progress over the next few years. First, I think \u2013 actually for you, Reed, why the comfort level with this level of negative free cash flow. And David, any sense you can give investors as to carry forward at these elevated levels, does it get better but take a while to get to breakeven, any help would be appreicated?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, when we produce an amazing show like Stranger Things, that\u2019s a lot of capital upfront, and then you get a payout over many years. And seeing the positive returns on that for the business as a whole is what makes us comfortable that we should continue to invest and integrate to basically self develop many more properties as Ted can find the appropriate ones. And then there\u2019s comfort with being able to finance it and of course our debt to market cap is incredibly low and conservative, so we\u2019ve got lots of room there. And I think that combination that it\u2019s spent well and we can raise it is what makes us very excited. And the irony is the faster that we grow and the faster we grow, the owned originals, the more drawn on free cash flow that will be. So in some senses that negative free cash flow will be an indicator of enormous success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">David Wells</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then to annotate your second part of your question, like Reed said, this is a success scenario in a sense of as we scale and if we\u2019re scaling faster, we\u2019re going to reinvest part of that back into the content and that has implications on the cash side. So for us, as we\u2019ve seen success with both the popularity of our owned originals, we\u2019ve expanded into other content verticals. And as we scale faster, as we grow faster globally, that has implications. That said, we gave you an indication of around 2 billion this time. We\u2019ve updated that to be between 2 billion and 2.5 billion. So you can think about that as a 10% to 15%. When you put that in line and compare that with our subscriber growth on the top line and you kind of get some indication that we\u2019re still being very disciplined about the efficiency of our content cohort investments and we\u2019re looking at how those shows perform over time, but if we have a bigger prize and if we see a bigger prize with the gross of the growth , that\u2019s going to have some implication on the cash flow side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple more for Ted and then I think we\u2019ll wrap up with Reed. Ted, one question I get a lot is investments in new movies. I think part of it is, with the TV series, it\u2019s a brand that goes forward, year after year of episodes versus one time for film and some could be very expensive as well and with the [indiscernible] approach. I think in the letter you talked about you believe Internet TV can reinvigorate the film business. So one, talk on your film strategy at this point; and two, any thoughts behind the statement in the letter would be helpful?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, look, we\u2019re doing a lot in the film space for a lot of the same reasons we\u2019re doing it in the television space, which is access to great content when consumers want it around the world. So we think it\u2019s a good investment. We\u2019re trying a lot of different things. Some of them work out great. Some of them work out not so great and we\u2019ve learned from every single one of them. So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that space because we can bring films to our members when they want them, which is when the world is talking about them. And that\u2019s almost impossible to do with a studio partner. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing down that road. I think that in success, our films will be able to attract subscribers and retain subscribers the way our series have and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working so hard at it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another question I get I think is just so noticeable is the investment you made in comedy and you\u2019ve talked a bit about that last quarter, Ted. But is there something behind that strategy in terms of forming also relationships with comedians that also might be actors in TV shows, movies, or is it simply ROI, so you keep investing more?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the category is remarkably efficient even at the premiums that you\u2019d have to pay to get the superstar talent attached to them because it gets a big audience. They can watch like movies and just think about it that the main cost of them is the talent themselves versus the cost of production. And it\u2019s been also a great way to invest in content partners because like Chris Rock by way of example who\u2019s getting ready to shoot his special for Netflix, he is right now starring in the next Adam Sandler movie that\u2019s being shot right now in New York. So we\u2019re really excited about being able to work with great talent like Aziz Ansari, like we do with Chelsea across the entire platform whenever we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And shifting over to Reed, I\u2019ve noticed in the letter it said over 1 billion hours a week of viewing on the Netflix platform. Is that 1.1 billion or 1.2 billion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And climbing. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. I think I want to wrap up with a couple of questions, first regulatory. Reed, I think you\u2019ve already expressed your opinion quite clearly on net neutrality. But more broadly if you look at the regulatory environment globally, particularly in Europe, there appears to be an environment that is a challenge for American companies and certainly Google and Facebook. What\u2019s your approach to the regulatory environment given these challenges?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, first on net neutrality, the recent effort that we participated in generated over 3 million additional comments to the FCC demanding that the net neutrality rules stay in place bringing the total to over 8 million comments. So certainly we, other companies, the public have weighed in heavily. We\u2019ll see where that goes. When you look at Europe, we\u2019re making big investments in local content, local productions, working well with local content companies. And so, I think it will be a really different dynamic or we hope so with Netflix than maybe with other firms, because just of the business structure. We\u2019re able to take some great French and German and other content, Spanish, this quarter and share it around the world and that creates big new markets. So think of us much more as trying to curate some of the world\u2019s best content and share it with the world versus the moniker of being a disruptive tech company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the last question for me, you\u2019re talking a lot about the shift from linear TV to on-demand viewing. It\u2019s something that you talk a lot about, Reed, and you talk about how much video time and how many Internet TV services you\u2019ll be successful. And while that\u2019s all well and good, I imagine that Netflix will have to continue to be the leader in this category. So this final question is, Reed, how does Netflix sustain and expand its leadership position? Because while the market opportunity might be big, I\u2019m sure you are busy executing every day?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">More watching, less sleep.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what are you doing and what is Netflix specifically doing to make sure that Netflix needs that more watching, less sleep charge?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, again, I\u2019m not sure we are leading it when you look how far ahead YouTube is. Now you might say, well, it\u2019s different content but it\u2019s still very engaging for the audience that\u2019s choosing it. We\u2019re not really focused on like who\u2019s ahead in certain things. What we focus on is doing our best work. And Ted runs a lot of that with the content. We\u2019re doing amazing work on product, making it easy to use, fast and then finally all these distribution agreements and marketing we\u2019re doing. So we\u2019re just improving around the whole company, growing what we have and we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019ve accomplished. But what\u2019s ahead is also super exciting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Mitchelson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you all very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Reed Hastings</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Wells</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ted Sarandos</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Doug.</p>", "twitContent": "$NFLX - Netflix's (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings on Q2 2017 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4088302-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-on-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "97", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17933", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17972", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4088302-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-on-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4088302-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-on-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
