Sales for the first quarter were $23.9 billion, up 4.9% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year, and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 in the first quarter. We were pleased with the start of the year as we executed within a more normalized spring environment and navigated a tough weather comparison with weather driven and demand that we saw in the first quarter of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All three of our U.S. divisions posted positive comps led by our Southern Division. On the international front, both Canada and Mexico posted another quarter of positive comps in local currency. The power of our interconnected retail strategy continues to gain traction in our international businesses as digital sites in both countries were recently updated driving sales growth and positive response from our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning back to the U.S. we saw a broad based growth across our store as both ticket and transactions grew in the quarter and all merchandising departments posted positive comps. Our commitment to new and innovative products continues to be a contributor of our ticket growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our merchants collaborate with our supplier partners to bring innovative and exclusive items to market that delivered value for our customers by saving them time and money. As Ted will detail the extension of Lithium-Ion Battery technology into the outdoor power category is an excellent example of our ongoing focus on innovation and we continue to see great sales in this category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another engine of growth for our business is the Pro customer. As Pro sales once again outpaced the DIY sales in the quarter, we recognized that Pro customers have needs that go beyond our traditional in store offerings and we believe that the work we are doing to strengthen our sales support, assortment and fulfilment for this customer base continues to resonate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, our in store tool room business helps our Pros more effectively run their business. In many cases our partnership with the Home Depot can translate into business for our Pros as we can connect to them with our do-it-for-me customers through our Pro referral platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see significant opportunity to help our Pros manage and grow their business while driving higher product pull through and strengthening our relationship with our do-it-for-me customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another component of our overall Pro strategy centers on Interline in the MRO customer. Use case 1, to rollout of Interline\u2019s catalogue of products to Home Depot stores is now live in over 1500 U.S. stores.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to roll out use case 2 which enables Interline customers to shop Home Depot stores using a swipe card that is linked to their Interline account. Interline sales growth outpaced the company average in the quarter and we remain very excited about the opportunity that Interline provides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The power of interconnected retail creates growth opportunities for the Home Depot. As we invest in this area, we are seeing a positive response from our customers in the form of improved customer satisfaction scores and increased sales. In the first quarter, our online traffic growth was robust and our online sales grew approximately 23%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our supply chain continues to be a source of strength for our business. The flexibility and nimbleness of our supply chain is a competitive advantage. This is particularly evident during our busy spring selling season when regional weather conditions vary resulting in spiky demand patterns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operationally, nimbleness and flexibility carries over into our stores. This spring, M.E.T our Merchandising Execution Team helps us drive productivity by reducing merchandising set times by 25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Store, associates efficiently manage great flow within the store while remaining focused on providing strong customer service in the aisle. And we hired over 85,000 new associates to ramp up for spring sales with a simplified application process reducing the time it takes to complete an application by upto 80%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The success of our first quarter is a result of each and every one of our associates, and I\u2019d like to thank them for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Looking forward, we plan to continue this momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ted Decker</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Craig and good morning everyone. We had a great first quarter driven by continued strength across the store. Our Pro business was particularly strong and outpaced the company average. We also saw excellent growth in our online business as online sales grew approximately 23%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps. Appliances, Lumber and Flooring had double-digit comps in the quarter. Tools, Electrical, Plumbing, Decor and Kitchen-Bath were above the Company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Indoor Garden was inline with the company average. Building Materials, Millwork, Hardware, Lighting, Paint and Outdoor Garden were positive but below the company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, total comp transactions grew by 1.5% and comp average ticket increased 3.9%. The increase in average ticket was positively impacted by a number of things including customers trading upto new, innovative products. Commodity price inflation in Lumber, Building Materials and Copper also positively impacted average ticket growth by approximately 75 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at big ticket sales in the first quarter, transactions over $900 which represent approximately 20% of worldwide [ph] sales were up 15.8%. Few drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were Appliances, Flooring, and Roofing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, sales with our Pro customers outpaced the company average driven by both our high spend and low spend Pros. We saw strong comps in several Lumber categories, Wire, Commercial Industrial Lighting and gypsum [ph]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, the core of the store performed well and we saw strength in several maintenance and repair categories across the company. Classes that outperformed the company average included several Flooring categories, Tool Storage, Power Tools and a number of Bath Categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Craig mentioned earlier, our customers respond to new and innovative products. A perfect example is the customers\u2019 response when you are seeing a new lithium-ion battery technology in outdoor power. We\u2019ve partnered with the best suppliers put together a line up of tools that is the long lasting power and run time to get the job done without the hassle of gas and chords even with a lawnmower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our exclusive assortment at Ego and Ryobi Cordless mowers can handle the standard size of Europe with just one charge. In addition for those customers that prefer gas power, we\u2019ve got a powerful line-up led by Honda and Toro that includes 13 of the top 15 rated self propelled gas mowers on the market and all of these are retail exclusives to the Home Depot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Spring Black Friday event was a success. Our associates drove excitement around special buys in our stores and online and our customers respond. We saw increased traffic both in-store and on-line and strong comps and categories like Mix &amp; Match Patio, Outdoor Power Tools, Mowers and Chemicals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We strive to balance the art designs of retail. With our interconnected retail strategy, we are continually improving the customer experience by striving to create frictionless shopping across all channels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, our new simplified and expedited online checkout process reduces customer\u2019s checkout time by an average of 20%. In addition, we are leveraging our digital assets and big data to better know our customers and in turn better meet their needs to targettted online offerings and localized online experiences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, our refreshed mobile app personalizes the user\u2019s home page based on location, customer segment and shopping patterns. We are pleased with the customer engagement in response to these enhancements and we are seeing increased conversion rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let me turn our attention to the second quarter. We continuously introduce innovation and value that save our customers both time and money. A great example of this is the new PPG Timeless Exterior Stain and Sealant. This is the first PPG branded product offered at the Home Depot and is their most advanced endurable line of woodcare on the market, with enhanced oil technology, improved resins, stronger UV absorbers and better water repellency this product provides outstanding, outdoor protection from the elements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">PPG Timeless Exterior Stain and Sealant is exclusive to the Home Depot. Another exciting new product is the Ring Outdoor Cam with motion activated floodlight. This is the first high definition security camera with building floodlights, two way talk, automated recording and a siren alarm. The best part is that this product is easy to install next directly to your mobile device so you can monitor your property anytime, anywhere. This product launched exclusively at the Home Depot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, all the new product offerings we are hearing up for our upcoming events in the second quarter. We begin to look out for Thrill of the Grill, Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Fourth of July events where we will be offering more of great value and special bites for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carol Tome</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales were $23.9 billion, a 4.9% increase from last year. Our total company comps or same store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.8% in February, 4.3% in March and 6.2% in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6% for the quarter, with positive comps up 6.3% in February, 4.6% in March and 6.8% in April. The cadence of our monthly comps was impacted a bit by weather and by the timing of Easter this year versus last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusting for Easter, on a like-for-like basis, our U.S. comps were 2.9% in March and 8% in April. Two more comments about our first quarter sales growth. First, for activity purposes, we record comp sales when tender is accepted and we report sales revenue when the transaction is completed. The difference is known as deferred sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Compared to last year, our deferred sales grew by $116 million. As a result, our reported sales growth was less than our comp sales growth. Second, versus last year fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $71 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total company gross margin was 34.1% for the quarter, a decrease of 9 basis points from last year. As expected, the modest decline in our gross margin was primarily driven by a change in the mix of products sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect our gross margin to decline by approximately 15 basis points from what we reported in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 59 basis points to 20.1%. Our expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth along with continued expense control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the quarter, our expenses were roughly $18 million under our plan, albeit some of the variance was due to timing. While our expenses grew at approximately 39% of our sales growth rate in the first quarter, for fiscal 2017we now expect our expenses to grow at approximately 43% of our sales growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our operating margin for the first quarter was 14% an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the first quarter of $241 million up slightly from last year. In the first quarter our effective tax rate was 35.2% compared to 36.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. The year-over-year change in our effective tax rate was driven largely by a new FASB stock compensation accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 36.3%. Our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $1.67 an increase of 16% from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now moving to some additional highlights. During the first quarter, we opened two new stores in the U.S. and one new store in Mexico bringing our total store count to 2,281 and selling square footage to 238 million square feet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total sales per square foot for the first quarter was $394 up 4.6% from last year. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter merchandised inventories were $13.6 billion up $390 million from last year and inventory turns were 4.8 times flat to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Accounts payable grew by $427 million year-over-year. In the first quarter, we repurchased $1.25 billion or approximately 8.5 million shares of outstanding stock. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.75 billion of outstanding stocks using access cash, bringing total anticipated 2017 share repurchases to $5 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Computed on the average of beginning and ending long term debt and equity for the trailing 12-month. Return on invested capital with approximately 32.3%, 310 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To wrap up the commentary on our first quarter financial results, we were pleased as sales and earnings were better than we planned. Looking ahead while U.S. GDP forecasts are mixed, housing continues to be a growing asset class, and our sales thus far in May have been very good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But relative to our plan we do anticipate some foreign exchange pressure. So today we are reaffirming the sales growth guidance we laid out on our fourth quarter earnings call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For fiscal 2017, we expect sales to increase by approximately 4.6% with positive comps of approximately 4.6%. For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given our first quarter expense performance we are lifting our earnings per share growth guidance. For fiscal 2017, we now expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 11% to $7.15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we thank you for your participation in today's call and Catherine we are now ready for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simeon Ari Gutman with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Ari Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Looking at in different markets across the country, can you tell us if you\u2019re seeing a broadening across markets, meaning, if there were some of the laggards out there. Are the speeding up? And then, are you seeing any moderation in some of the faster improving markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We actually look at the variability of our markets and in the quarter our variability narrowed about 40 basis points year-over-year which was pretty consistent with what we saw in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Ari Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that narrowing, I guess, can you elaborate if that\u2019s a function of the fast going \u2013 getting slower or some of the slower improving getting faster?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s really \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing a big change in the regional sales other than where we have some weather impacts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Ari Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then my follow-up on flow-through which has been pretty strong and consistent. And it\u2019s a function of both gross margin and the SG&amp;A. We know the guidance for the rest of the year. Thinking really towards the end of this year into next year, anything sort of good guys or bad guys think about that impacts going forward. I mean, now this year gross margin a little weaker because of just mix headwinds, but as you look out a little bit longer term are there anything positive or negative we should think about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Simeon, good morning. So, nothing at this point, and as you know we have an investor conference coming up in December and we\u2019ll give you lot more color about our point of view for fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Ari Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Appreciate it. Nice quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll continue on to Michael Lasser with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Deferred revenue was bigger this quarter than it's been in the past recognized that next quarter. To what degree is that a leading indicator of the business given the nature of the sales that are better in that number?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. There were three big drivers of the deferred revenue growth year-on-year. One you\u2019ve heard commentary about our dot-com sales growth, up 23% year-on-year, not all those sales are completed at the time of that we take the tender. Our dot-com sales now make up 6.6% of our total sales. We also saw growth in our services business. Our services business grew faster than our company average and Ted called out flooring as an example. Those were the two biggest drivers of the deferred sales increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is a leading indicator for the next few quarters given what\u2019s going into those numbers?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We would anticipate continues strong growth in those categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then my follow-up questions are on the e-comp business, obviously you\u2019re doing really well through that channel. To what extent is it validating that consumers increasingly want to buy the home improvement product through the online channel and subsequently going to expose you to greater and greater levels of competition?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the interesting think for us is over 45% of our orders on homedepot.com the customer is actually choosing to pick up into our stores. So they are finding it incredibly convenient to blend the channels and utilize all the assets that we have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is that percentage changing at all, Craig, I think you mentioned [Indiscernible]?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s been growing over the past 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yep.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot, and good morning, and great quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had a question on big-ticket comps in the quarter. Seems to be one of the key bright spots here where it accelerated up 15.8%. I think you said, you mentioned a couple of categories. Do you think that reflects an acceleration in market share and maybe some of the benefits from company\u2019s specific initiatives in the Pro focus or how do you balance that with also maybe an acceleration and demand trends overall?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll start and let Ted comment on this. I do think it's an acceleration of the customer's willingness to spend in big-ticket projects. We\u2019ve seen strong remodel business with our Pro, but then it's also categories that we've invest in as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I\u2019d add to that. It\u2019s a really all the above that the customers responding to the product and the innovation, certainly there\u2019s some very big-ticket items like appliances where we had double-digit comps again. But across the portfolio as I\u2019d mentioned before we track the purchase patterns from OPP up the line structure and we continue to see willingness and response from the consumer when we\u2019re showing great value on innovative products at higher price points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then services is going quite well, those obviously are bigger ticket items. In our Pro customer, which here, get a much larger items per basket where you\u2019re driving a project and that's been very healthy as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That's helpful. And then to follow-up on gross margin, mix has been the primary driver of the slight decline. Can you maybe speak to some of the other underlying drivers that you talked about in the past whether it's the productivity and supply chain work and then the partial offset from investments in price, are you seeing a change in the pace for either of those items?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, let\u2019s talk about supply chain first. Supply chain did contribute one basis point with gross margin expansion in the first quarter. That\u2019s after three basis points of pressure coming from higher fuel costs. Again, like the demand that we had in the first quarter we were very pleased with our supply chain performance. In the first quarter in fact expenses were out plan, so that a good story. And some of the other drivers, its all part of the portfolio that Ted and the Merchants run and is working just the way we want it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Question on some of the categories, the double-digit categories specifically flooring, could you just highlight what appears to be well above the industry? Could you talk about what's working there? What\u2019s allowing you to gain share?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have a nice mix there. The hard surface flooring had been much stronger over the past couple of years, and we\u2019ve done a lot of work in our showrooms with hard surface flooring particularly with tile and laminate. But recently vinyl plank has been taking off, so luxury vinyl plank manufacturers are now putting a solid core in the products, so you can get much greater use cases about final product. And its -- the efficacy of it and the look is getting better and better and that selling very well. And then soft flooring, soft flooring is not dead, and we simplify and go to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Long, long process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re seeing terrific strength with our soft flooring categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019re referring to the whole house installation price, is that what you\u2019re referring to in soft flooring?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Second question, regarding big-ticket in general, as referred to, very good in the quarter, how much did the lumber inflation play into the big number you reported there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lumber was a little more than half of that 75 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Little more than half. Okay. That 75 basis points, does that on the whole year comp or just down the growth of the \u2013 I guess, it would be the same actually on the full year comp or the growth of big ticket?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That was only on the average ticket growth for that company. In terms of performance of big ticket categories that is more driven by appliances and flooring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not so much [Indiscernible].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Hughes</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Nice quarter. Congrats.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, couple of questions here. First off, do not to be nitpicky here, but if you \u2013 just a question on the cadence of comps in the quarters. So, Carol when you called out in the U.S. business, I guess, adjusted for Easter. March was 2.9% and then April was 8%. So as we think about that I assume that eight reflects, picking up some of the business that maybe even loss or didn't happen in March because of weather? And how should we about then maybe a run rate \u2013 more normalized run rate there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So, Brian, it was a little choppy in terms of the cadence, and we do think that was weather. If you look at our transactions in March were actually under 1% growth year-on-year and that was all weather-related. And when the weather improved in April the sales came back. So, we always talk to you about bathtub of that first half, but we had a bathtub effect in the first quarter, we did. And so we think now about the first half we would think that the first quarter will be slightly stronger than that second quarter, and the comps for the first half will be about the same as the comps for the back half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Then the second question I had is probably a follow-up to your prior question. With regard to online sales, we have seen a nice tick up here. Craig, you call that, you said 45% the online sales our Buy Online, Pick Up In Store.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other point, just remaining 55%, is there any color you can give on what people are actually buying online, has it surprise you in any way and maybe then there\u2019s a common on the profitability of those sales versus in-store sales?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me address the last part and then Kevin Hofmann is here who runs our online business. So let him comment on the sales patterns. When it comes to the profitability it's actually this whole customer engagement is becoming a blended element between online and in-store, and the customer is choosing in some cases, they start the shopping experience online, they finish in-store or they might vice-versa, start the store and actually finish online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so with 45% of the orders has been picked up, it is truly a blended effort and we look at that way, our merchants manage it as a total portfolio. So they see an entire blended mix of sales for the business. And that\u2019s actually how we run the business. So we don\u2019t focus on it individually by itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kevin Hofmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Brian, just the sales perspective certainly we see strength across the store. Our bath business has been doing very well. Our flooring business has been doing very well. Plumbing, power tools all doing very well and not to ignore the core building materials products, we see great visit traction Pro\u2019s shopping online, looking for inventory levels, looking at pricing, and that\u2019s been working very, very well for us as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Following up on just how you think about guidance. So, there was a swoon in the late summer last year, I was curious if you had any retrospect on what drove that and as you just think about modeling the business, is the growth in the market, the growth rate and sort of compares don't necessarily matter? Or do you think maybe as we lap through that that pause like it seemed to happen in late summer where you would expect to pick up some extra this year as we approach there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think with all kind of talked this out a lot, and we think Pros went on vacation. And good for them, they were busy, they\u2019ve got more work and then they know what to do it and they took some times off and then they back hard at work. And to your point should we ignore there? I don\u2019t think you should ever ignore a compare. But clearly there is demand that\u2019s being created by this housing market that is very strong. Home prices are up year-over-year over 5%, housing turnover over 4% and aging and housing stock, household formation. We see growth in private fixed residential investment every quarter. It still a long way to go back to reach back to the mean or 4% -- 4.5% of GDP, so lot of good momentum in our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I guess at that point [Indiscernible] I mean, the compares do ease. We talked about a pretty normal spring, it doesn't sound like there\u2019s any pull forward into 1Q out of 2Q on the spring business. So why isn\u2019t this a 5% to 6% growth business through the balance of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, a few things. First as I mentioned, we\u2019ve go some currency pressure coming our way. We estimate that currently pressure to be $250 million. Second, it is the middle of May and it\u2019s a little early to start thinking about looking for the full year, but as I said, sales as far in May has been very good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think one of the comment would be, Chris that, while we had a great indoor garden business with power equipment, the outdoor garden business in the first quarter really had come alive, then you saw that in the flatness of our ticket $50 and under. There were parts of the country where it was pretty wet for people to be out, preparing their landscape for planting. So I think that was a factor as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then my follow-up is there is anything to as you think about different cycles that you've all seen in this business, seen the traffic number for this quarter, ticket continues to lead which is very encouraging, but at the same time traffic matters. How are you thinking about that in the context of the cycle? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ted got some really great data on traffic. You might want to share that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So we\u2019d look at the contributors to our transactions by obviously all the different price breaks. And it is as Craig just said; it is an outdoor garden story on the transaction, so that\u2019s why we\u2019d be a little conservative. You obviously have to get some good weather into Q2 to drive that outdoor business. Q1 wasn\u2019t practically good or bad. It was a more normal spring. We were not concerned that there was much of anything pulled forward. So we are expecting that business to come in outdoor garden.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when you talk about the bigger trends, we\u2019ve often mentioned the 40 classes that we track from the prior peak in 2006 and we still have 12 of those 40 top classes of good that have not recovered to the peak. So those tend to be the much bigger product or projects rather involving lot of millwork and building materials. So while we\u2019re seeing a lot of strength in that business and very robust, I called out roofing as a double-digit driver, but that whole portfolio you generally looking at adding square footage to get the big project, driven projects and we\u2019re looking forward to that comment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That sales opportunity by the way is $1.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. Thanks very much guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll continue on to Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks so much and Good morning everyone. So your online business seemed to reaccelerate from the trend that you saw all of last year. I'm interested in what you think drove that business whether is it tilt towards big ticket or changes that you made? And also for the past couple of years online growth has been strongest in the first quarter. It seems almost like the seasonality is changing. And if you could talk about if there's any rhyme or reason to that would be helpful to understand that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Matt, as you know. As you know, this is an area that we\u2019ve been investing in. And so I think the investments that we\u2019re making is improving the customer experience. And I\u2019ll let Kevin talk about this specific.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kevin Hofmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We\u2019ve been refocused on improving the experience across the whole shopping funnel and we\u2019ve made really large savvy design, last fall we upgraded our mobile app substantially. And those have paid nice dividends for us. From a seasonality perspective I just think you\u2019re seeing core categories that we tend to be strong in online, penetrate well in the first quarter and that what\u2019s drving the growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Matt, if I could add a couple of numbers. The visits were up 15% year-on-year. Our conversion rate increased 30 basis points year-on-year, so if you\u2019re visits are up and you\u2019re conversion is up, your sales are going to grow. And a lot of that is because of the site experience improvements that Kevin and team has made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s terrific. If we think about that, I\u2019m sure you have data on customer age and you could probably tells from kind of products that you\u2019re purchasing and the kind of products they\u2019re engaging in. If you can give out online transaction, is there sign that the millennial customers disproportionately patronizing enterprise online or is it more evenly distributed across age groups?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We actually see it more evenly distributed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you so much. And then one piece of cleanup if I could, you gave the comp growth for the biggest ticket basket. Can you give us the comp growth for the small ticket basket [Indiscernible] please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you so much guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll hear from Kate McShane with Citi Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kate McShane</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good morning. My question is centered around any potential bankruptcies in the place and if in the space, excuse me. And if bankruptcy were to happen, how does it play up to your business and how would it change what you\u2019re already experiencing in appliances, if anything?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We clearly have invested to disproportionately take share in categories that we overlap with key competitors who have been -- having their challenges. And we\u2019re going to continue to focus on trying to capture as much business as we can. It\u2019s in categories like appliances, tools, hand tool, storage. There's multiple categories that we overlap in businesses where we think we can continue to grow share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s an appliance retailer that recently announced store closing basically going out of business and we\u2019re seeing sales coming our way and in an environment where they\u2019re liquidating the stores. It\u2019s very\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s really interesting actually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, very interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kate McShane</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And then if I could just follow-up on a bit granular, but I know you\u2019ve highlighted that millwork is an opportunity, but it still trending below the company comp average. What is holding that category back? And do you have any expectations on when that comp could accelerate and what could drive it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned, these are much larger projects, you can replace on exterior door to refresh your look or wear and tear, but if you\u2019re going to be getting into a number of interior doors, add windows et cetera to your house, you\u2019re generally doing much larger remodel and one that would likely add square footage to the house. And we\u2019re confident, while that business hasn\u2019t come roaring back just yet. It's healthy. But price appreciation Carol mentioned in housing, this is were people can be much more confident to invest in their home with the confidence that that investment will be rewarded with a higher home value. So they\u2019re very bullish on the state of housing and the likelihood of these much larger projects getting underway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is really nothing statistic to me. There are 76 million owned households in the United States and of those there are only 3.2 million that having negative equity in their home. And you go back to 2011, 11 million of those household had negative equity in their home. So the amount shows that since 2011 homeowners have enjoyed 130% increase in wealth, if you will, coming from home price depreciation. So on average $50,000 per household. So, you can imagine at some point, to Ted\u2019s point, they\u2019ll take that down out and do a bigger millwork or total remodel job.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think the other part is where there\u2019s 3.8 months of supply of inventory and housing on the market compared to historical norm of six. Like that actually leans into people thinking about remodel versus move as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kate McShane</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll now hear from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot and good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is around the Pro business. Maybe you could provide some color on the degree of outperformance relative to DIY this quarter relative to recent quarters. That would be helpful?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Should I jump in? I\u2019ll be happy to jump in. So our Pro business grew twice as fast as our DIY customer in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was pretty balance between our big-ticket Pro and our small spend Pro as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And as it relates to Interline specifically, you talked about some improvements with the use cases and those starting to roll up and get some traction. As you anticipate the balance of the year from those use cases and others you\u2019re working on, would you expect a further acceleration in Interline growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are very pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in Interline. And in use case one, for example I mentioned that we\u2019re at 1500 plus U.S. stores now, and actually seems sales ahead of what we anticipated with that. So, yes, we\u2019re excited about the opportunity with Interline as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the sales growth rate was higher than the company average in the first quarter. It\u2019s less than 2% of our sales that we can\u2019t see that in the top line yet, but we will see it as these use cases gain traction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll now hear from Matt McClintock with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt McClintock</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi.

What product categories would you say over index on innovation or what you would call the benefit of innovation to those product categories?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, there\u2019s actually a ton. I\u2019ll call out the \u2013 maybe some most exciting and technologically savvy. But when you look across the entire store, we get a distributable monthly report of all the great new innovative products. And it's fascinating to go through it. This is a 200, 300 page report of product every month. It's calling out, it could be lightweight drywall, it could be something as simple as cutting plywood into 4x4 panels to have that pre-cut item for a project, but certainly on the more tacky innovative side the lithium-ion battery technology has to be one of the largest \u2013 we have a full riding tractor, RYOBI tractor available for sale that I've ridden it. You can cut your lawn on battery powered tractor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Craig mentioned the outdoor power. We have the power that the run time of gas on blowers and trimmers and hedge trimmers. We\u2019ve seen it in portable power for many years now and it's now accelerating an outdoor power. And then the second one is LED lighting technology in not just individual A-line bulbs, but you\u2019re now seeing integrated LED in your ceiling fans, in your light fixtures and that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving our commercial and industrial lighting that I called out as having such strong comps. Is how you\u2019re getting that integrated fixture, getting all sorts of little bit attractive design elements powered by that incredibly thin lighting form factor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it goes on. Our LifeProof carpet and our PetProof carpet were technology enables us to offer lifetime stain guarantees on the product. So, really across the whole storage its super exciting, great innovated product that customers are responding to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt McClintock</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for that. And Carol if I could ask one follow-up, just inventory turns for the quarter were flattish year-over-year. How should we think about inventory as we progress through the remainder of the year? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, on an unrounded basis inventory turn were slightly better than last year. And for the full year we\u2019re expecting inventory turns to be up year-on-year, a few ten.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt McClintock</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll now hear from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks guys. Just one more e-commerce question, have you guys \u2013 I\u2019m sure you have \u2013 it\u2019s probably been asked. Just to go over again. What percent, what categories in your storage do you think lend themselves best to online? And in particular I'm curious about how the appliance business does online, is that something that you think can work through that channel? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think we shared number years back that we looked at all of our categories and had segments of the business that we felt would lean more towards the digital world. Those things would be products that were smaller cube, more dense, higher value would lend themselves to that type of business. And so, things like faucets and power tools for example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What's interesting is that we've been in a position to be able to not only grow that business online, but we\u2019ve also been able to grow those categories in store at the same time, and so, that something that we see as a real advantage in our business. And then other categories that maybe the customer actually starts online, but they may finish in the physical world would be things like Floorings and Kitchens and so the research has done there but many times the customer still wants to come in and talk to one of our associates and maybe go through some product and questions that they may have about the process. So it\u2019s really something that we have been watching carefully, but we\u2019ve been incredibly fortunate that we\u2019ve been able to grow both channels really across categories that we think lend themselves to the online business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So \u2013 as customers look a lot on line before they actually come into the store and shop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So just a follow up there, are you seeing the people actually transact for appliances online and then the second follow up is have you ever quantified like you know x percent of your products are in that first bucket of lend themselves well to online?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I mean customers do go online and some customers buy online. Just like some customers buy Patio online. They are comfortable doing that without sitting in it. But again, the majority of our business in those kind of categories are in store and we haven\u2019t spent a lot of time trying to quantify.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. Very helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You bet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Alan Rifkin with BTIG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alan Rifkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. You said that your average ticket growth of 3.9% was boosted in part by new product introduction. Curious like for a given product what is the duration of like the -- that can help contribute to average ticket and what does the pipeline look like for new products in the future? And I do have a follow up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean it really varies by category on what the cycle is in terms of product innovation. Historically you could think about a product in a 36 month kind of timeframe. Today those categories or that cycle are ways shorter than that. So it varies quite a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alan Rifkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you. And then certainly you got very solid expense growth in the first quarter which led you to take a full year ratio from 49% down to 43% after getting 39% expense growth in Q1 which is your one of your lower revenue quarters. If you take that together with the fact that comps ease going forward, it would appear that the expense leverage in the following three quarters could even be better than what we saw in Q1, which would maybe lead to a number that\u2019s even below 43%. Is that a correct line of thinking on my part?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alan, as you know we put out guidance based on our point of view on the business and we always try to do better. If I\u2019ll look at the next three quarters I would say the expense growth factor will be slightly higher in the second quarter and then lower in the third and fourth quarter principally because of year-over-year comparison. But we do like to put out numbers that we can beat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alan Rifkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you very much Carol.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks. Had a couple of questions, kind of follow ups. Carol you mentioned that May was very very good, right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I know last May there were some -- there were some, I guess, Memorial Day shift that maturity on sort of a 3 or 4 depend on how you look at it. When you say very good, is that a two year or three year stack, how should we think about that in terms of very good and exit rate?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just look at our \u2013 versus our plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Always versus the plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Always versus the plan</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the second question and maybe sort of a follow up broader speaking. There is a lot going on in the industry, a lot of change and Craig I think you answered being positioned to help the customer and take that share. Could you talk a little bit maybe about the position in terms of how you work with vendors? It seems like you are getting a lot of innovation in products, maybe from some of those vendors that might be thinking differently about their other ways of getting product to market, could you help us understand that side of the equation, and maybe Ted us well especially given online growth etcetera as to how the vendors are working with you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, I\u2019ll start with a comment and turn it over to Ted. I mean this is an area that we have focused hard on for the past eight to nine years. During the downturn, one of the things that we clearly saw was that if the customer was going to spend money in 2008, 2009, 2010 it was going to be largely around new and innovative products and if that product can help them save time or money they would definitely step in even in those tough economic times. So this has been a focus that Ted and the merchants have had in a big way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we have a huge focus on collaboration with our supplier partners and we appreciate that we have to win together and two things we always want our partners to know is that when they are looking for volume, there is no better place than the Home Depot that no one is going to drive their volume and their productivity at their production facilities like the Home Depot and a second thing and you notice all the exclusive I called out on my prepared remarks no one can launch a product like the Home Depot and we want to continue working and collaborating with our partners driving their volume and introducing their innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then I have one follow up with the house-keeping what was private label credit penetration in the quarter and you\u2019ve talked a lot about strength to consumer from housing, I\u2019m just curious how the credit dynamics are looking to gas?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we were very pleased with our performance in our private label credit card. The penetration grew year-over-year by 20 basis points now stands at 22.6% and we see that the sales on our private label card for our Pro the growth rate was faster than the company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Diane Dayhoff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Catherine, we have time for one more question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll go to John Baugh with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Baugh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Congratulations on a nice quarter. Most of my questions are answered, but I was curious on the Southern division comment being the strongest, is that due to weather compare or demographics or both?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the southern division did have the benefit of the $70 million in storm sales year-over-year in Louisiana and there is still some recovery benefit going there, so that was part of the driver for the southern division\u2019s outperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Baugh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And any weather or excuse me calendar issues to be aware of Carol for the coming quarter or the year? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. Not that I can think of the timing of the Memorial Day maybe of year-over-year we may have a [Indiscernible] volume to a different fiscal market. I can\u2019t think it better does; we\u2019ll clarify that at the end of the second quarter but no quarter-to-quarter differences, no.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Baugh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you, good luck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Diane Dayhoff</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well thank you every one for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you on our second quarter earnings conference call in August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.
