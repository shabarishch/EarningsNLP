We had a strong quarter for both sales and earnings, as we continue to see strength across our business. Sales for the third quarter were 23.2 billion, up 6.1% from last year. Comp sales were up 5.5% from last year and our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.9%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.60 in the third quarter, up 18.5% versus last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the U.S., all three of our divisions posted positive comps in the third quarter led by our Southern division. All our regions positively comped except one region in the North. In New England, we had a small negative comp due primarily to a state sales tax holiday in fiscal 2015 that did not repeat in 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Internationally, our Mexican and Canadian businesses had another quarter of solid performance. Mexico and Canada reported positive comps in local currency marking 52 and 20 consecutive quarters of positive comp growth, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Ted will detail, we saw balanced growth from both ticket and transactions. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps and we saw healthy balance of growth among both our Pro and DIY customers, with Pro sales growing faster than DIY sales in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Pro business continues to be driven by a strong offering of brands that Pros demand consistent product innovation, as well as enhanced delivery and credit offerings to help them more efficiently manage their business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the third quarter, we anniversaried the acquisition of Interline and are proud of the team's efforts in the first year. The Interline integration continues to progress as we work to execute against the business use cases to leverage Interline's capabilities. We're excited about the opportunity Interline provides us to expand our share of wallet with customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see double-digit sales growth from our online business. This quarter, online sales grew over 17% and represented 5.6% of overall sales. Over 40% of our online orders are picked up in the store which we view is a positive sign of our physical stores continued relevance with our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter, we rolled out a complete homedepot.com redesign. Content was enhanced to display in full screen optimizing our desktop and tablet displays for customers. You will recall during last year's third quarter, we opened and began shipping from our third direct fulfillment center or DFC in the U.S. With this distribution infrastructure in place, we have been better able to serve the needs of our online customers faster and more directly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are still assorting the appropriate products to house in our three DFC's but we\u2019ve been able to reduce delivery costs and improve overall customer experience. We continue to invest in our supply chain transformation by optimizing our network through initiatives like Supply Chain Sync.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter, we began the rollout of Sync to our Northern division and we continue to onboard new suppliers in the Southern and Western divisions. As you know, this is a multiyear, multi-phased endeavor but we are pleased with our progress thus far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Changing customer expectations are requiring that we simplify our operations in order to improve productivity and at the same time reinvest in the customer experience. Our efforts to drive operational excellence and freight handling in the stores are doing just that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Reducing both time and footsteps needed to move freight end-to-end or from truck-to-shelf will enable us to reallocate associate time to enhance the customer experience. One way we\u2019re reinvesting in the customer experience is through initiatives like COMS and BODFS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you will recall, COMS is our new customer order management system that was fully deployed last quarter in all U.S. stores. And BODFS or Buy Online, Deliver From Store remains on track to be rolled out by the end of the fiscal year. In the 1,600 plus stores where we have BODFS, our on-time delivery service is now exceeding our target and we have seen double-digit increase in the number of deliveries. We\u2019re pleased with the positive customer response to this enhanced delivery option.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the macro environment, we believe home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the aging housing stock in the U.S. continue to support growth in our business. As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales growth and lifting our earnings per share growth guidance for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me close by thanking our 400,000 plus associates for their hard work, dedication and commitment to our customers. I\u2019d like to give a special thanks to all the associates and suppliers who have worked to help the communities impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They have worked tirelessly under difficult circumstances, often in the face of disruption in their own lives caused by these storms. Service to our communities is a core part of The Home Depot culture and we're very proud of their efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ted Decker</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our results in the third quarter. We saw strength across the store, balanced between Pro and DIY customers as well as continued growth in our online business. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps led by appliances which had double-digit comps in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lumber, tools, outdoor garden, indoor garden, lighting, d\u00e9cor and flooring were above the company's average comp. Plumbing, hardware, building materials, kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical and paint were positive but below the company average. We continue to see balanced growth between transactions and average ticket in the quarter. Total comp transactions increased to 2.4% while comp average ticket grew 3.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our average ticket increase was slightly impacted by commodity price inflation, mainly from lumber and building materials. The total impact to ticket growth from commodity price inflation was approximately 35 basis points. In addition, our average ticket growth was negatively impacted by approximately 33 basis points primarily due to a weaker Mexican peso.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at big ticket sales in the third quarter, transactions over $900, which represent approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 11.3%. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were appliances, flooring and roofing. Once again, we saw strong outperformance in many Pro heavy categories as Pro sales grew faster than the company's average comp. This led the strong comps in commercial and industrial lighting, fencing, plywood, pressure-treated decking and interior doors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the same time, we also saw strength with the DIY customer as they undertook various projects around the house. This project business drove strong comps in special order carpet, tool storage, laminate flooring and vanities. Weather remained favorable throughout the quarter and extended the outdoor project selling season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By leveraging forecast analytics, strong supplier collaboration and our flexible supply chain, we were able to meet customer demand throughout the prolonged selling season. Categories such as lawnmowers, seed, planters, fertilizers and soils and mulch posted comps above the company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Craig mentioned, our vendor partners, supply chain and internal teams rallied to support our customers impacted by Hurricane Matthew and the flooding in Louisiana. Through strong collaboration we were able to get product to our communities in their time of need. We estimate the impact of storm-related sales in the quarter to be approximately $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we held our annual Halloween, Harvest and Labor Day events. These events were a huge success and increased both foot traffic in our stores and volume online. We experienced robust comps in decorative holiday, appliances and power tools.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our interconnected business, we made significant changes for online experiences in the third quarter. We rolled out an updated HD.com site and redesigned our app, both without interruption. The update includes an expanded buy box which now makes it easier for our customers to select their preferred fulfillment option at checkout whether that be delivered to home or picked up in store. These changes have already yielded positive results as we have seen improvements in overall site performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Product innovation remains a key part of our strategy. Adding to our broad lineup of professional grade power tools, we were excited to introduce two new breakthroughs. From Milwaukee, we are launching a 9 amp-hour lithium battery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This battery pack delivers up to five times the runtime, 35% more power and runs 60% cooler than standard lithium battery packs, saving customers valuable time and money. The new battery is fully compatible with more than 100 Milwaukee M18 tools and provides the next big step toward complete corded replacement. This new and advanced battery is a big-box exclusive to The Home Depot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From Makita, we\u2019re excited to announce the new Sub-Compact Drill and Impact Driver. These revolutionary new tools are the smallest Pro tools in the market delivering 18-volt power. The electronically controlled brushless motor in these products enables them to run cooler and more efficiently while at the same time matching the torque and RPMs needed to meet the demands of the Pro customer. These products are another big-box exclusive to The Home Depot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The winter season and cooler temperatures are rapidly approaching and we have a great lineup of excellent values and special buys for our customers during our Black Friday Holiday and gift center events. One product to look for this holiday season is the exciting new Star Shower Motion Laser Light.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This new and improved laser light projector not only projects thousands of green and red stars for festive display in front of the home but it also turns into a motion laser light show at a press of a button. This product is a channel exclusive to The Home Depot. Our upcoming events, new product launches and outstanding execution by our associates will help drive a great holiday season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carol.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carol Tom\u00e9</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ted, and hello everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $23.2 billion, a 6.1% increase from last year driven primarily by positive comp sales as well as the impact of Interline brands versus last year foreign currency rates, primarily a weaker Mexican peso, negatively impacted total sales growth by approximately $76 million or 0.35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total company comps or same-store sales were positive 5.5% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.8% in August, 6.5% in September and 6.1% in October. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 4.2% in August, 6.9% in September and 6.5% in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One last comment on comps. While we are on a path to fully integrate Interline brands, we aren\u2019t at a point where it makes sense to include its results in our comps and operational sell metrics. When the business becomes more integrated, we will include Interline's results in our operational metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total company gross margin was 34.7% for the quarter, an increase of 6 basis points from last year. The change in our gross margin is explained largely by the following factors. First, as expected, we had 24 basis points of gross margin contraction due to the impact of Interline. Second, we had 13 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain driven primarily by increased productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, we had 17 basis points of gross margin expansion arising from a change in the mix of products sold and improvement in inventory shrinkage. For fiscal 2016, we continue to expect our gross margin rate to be about the same as what we reported in fiscal 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 62 basis points to 20.4%. In the quarter, we had some expenses that we did not plan for; including $23 million of legal expenses related to our 2014 data breach and approximately $15 million of storm-related cleanup expenses. Even with this unplanned expense pressure, we delivered total expenses under our plan. For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 32% of our fiscal 2016 sales growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our operating margin for the quarter was 14.3%, an increase of 68 basis points from last year. Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $236 million, down $4 million from last year. In the third quarter, our effective tax rate was 36.2% compared to 37.1% last year. For fiscal 2016, we expect our income tax provision rate to approximately 36.7%. Our diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.60, an increase of 18.5% from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, merchandised inventories were $13.2 billion, up $746 million from last year. Inventory turns were 5 times, flat with the third quarter of last year. Year-over-year accounts payable grew slightly faster than inventory increasing by $818 million to $8.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the third quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion or approximately 16.4 million shares of outstanding stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to approximately $4.6 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, during the quarter we took advantage of an attractive interest rate environment and raised $2 billion of incremental long-term debt, including $1 billion tranche with a record setting 40-year maturity carrying a coupon of 3.5%. We will use the proceeds of this debt issuance to repurchase outstanding shares bringing our targeted fiscal 2016 share repurchases to $7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Accordingly, we expect to repurchase approximately $2.4 billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 29.1%, 280 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to our guidance. We remain encouraged by the strength of our core business. Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects modest GDP growth, continued benefits from U.S. housing markets and candidly the market share gains. While we have tough fourth quarter comparisons, as Ted described, we plan for them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance. For fiscal 2016, we expect sales to grow by approximately 6.3% with comps of approximately 4.9%. Note that our sales forecast assumes foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For earnings per share, we\u2019ve tightened up our tax provision and outstanding share forecast and are lifting our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share to grow by approximately 15.9% to $6.33.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. Catherine, we are now ready for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll hear first from Michael Lasser with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Craig, the question here is how do you comp the comp in the fourth quarter and the first quarter given the very cooperative weather conditions that you saw last year? I know you briefly touched on that but maybe you can provide a little bit more detail? Plus what are you looking for to ensure that you don\u2019t misread the state of a cycle and either respond too quickly or too slowly to potentially changing market conditions?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So on how do we comp the comp, I\u2019ll recall this was the conversation we had going into fiscal 2016 coming out of last year. Quite honestly, that\u2019s the hard work that the team does immediately following the performance that we had last year in the fourth quarter. We are up against big numbers. U.S. comp in the fourth quarter last year was 8.9%. But that\u2019s really the work the team started doing immediately following the close of that quarter. So we feel confident in the programs that merchant teams have laid out, the support with the supply chain teams and then of course our store associates taking those programs and driving them. Quite honestly that\u2019s our job. That\u2019s what we need to do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I could just jump in, it\u2019s Carol here. So we are in the middle of November and we are on track to deliver the sales that we just guided to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in terms of what you look at so that we don\u2019t miss anything, we\u2019ve shared in the past I think that we\u2019re constantly watching ticket and transaction and when you step away from the downturn in the mid-2000s, the previous downturn was 2001 and we saw a decline in average ticket. That was a little bit of a leading indicator. Now we have to be careful because ticket can be affected by things like weather. So when you have big ticket sales, for example, in the first and second quarter on things like tractors, weather can impact that. So we do watch ticket carefully. We balance that with transactions. What we\u2019re seeing in the business right now we like a lot. We see a nice balance between ticket transactions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in fact transact accelerated through the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Throughout the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Carol you mentioned that you anticipate some share gains in the fourth quarter. Historically you really haven\u2019t factored share gains into your longer-term outlook. What\u2019s changing now that\u2019s giving you the confidence to put that in there where you had an impact?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, as we look at the environment we see that there are share donors in certain categories. Ted called out that appliances was a double-digit comp for us in the third quarter. It contributed 50 basis points of our overall growth in the quarter, as for the year. And so as we look to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s always a big appliance selling season and we would expect to continue to grow appliances in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Michael, we\u2019ve obviously made a lot of investments over the past few years to make sure we\u2019re positioned to be able to capture that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And if I could add one last one on the SG&amp;A recognizing that you have one-time items quarter-in and quarter-out, good guys and no so good guys. So SG&amp;A has been growing 2% to 4% after being up at a much more moderate pace, I\u2019m talking on a per square foot basis. So are we just at a point where the business requires a little bit more investment because you\u2019ve had so many years of strong comp, and so the flow through might not be as strong moving forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I can take you back to the beginning of the year. We said that our expenses would grow at 40% of our sales growth rate. We are now seeing that our expenses this year will grow at 32% of our sales growth rate. And what that means, year-to-date our expenses have grown at 37.5% of our sales growth rate. For the fourth quarter, we should expect a lot of leverage on the SG&amp;A line, principally because we have year-over-year expense items that we will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year. Last year we had outperformance and bonus, we had some store cleanup costs. Those items will not repeat in the fourth quarter of this year, so expect a good flow through. Longer term, as we talked about and we talked about this at the beginning of the year, because of items like rising people costs and we\u2019re not alone. All companies are faced with rising people costs, over the longer term we would expect our expenses to grow at 50% of our sales growth rate. And we\u2019re not providing guidance for 2017 today but you would expect next year for us to come back and tell you it should be more in the 50% area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll now hear from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks and good morning. I just want to follow up on the question about the cycle and the outlook for demand in the category. Can you give us a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of bigger ticket discretionary projects? Are you seeing any sort of change in the types of projects consumers or Pros are focused on, basically anything that would indicate that we\u2019re maybe heading into a different part of the cycle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you look at the larger ticket sales, it\u2019s coming we believe from multiple areas. It\u2019s coming from the strength in the Pro business, it\u2019s coming from our services business, it\u2019s coming from things like the appliance sales growth. So it\u2019s a broad aspect of drivers behind the ticket. And when you look at the third quarter, actually our transactions over $900 was the largest quarter growth of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s important to just step back and look at where we are in terms of the cycle and focus on home price appreciation, because that\u2019s a big driver of our business. Since 2011, homeowners have seen a 95% increase in their home equity. That\u2019s come about because of rising prices as well as if you have a mortgage, you\u2019ve been making mortgage payments since 2011. So homeowners really do view their home as an investment and not an expense. So the question is, okay, great, well what does it mean for 2017 and beyond? While we see home prices have recovered in certain parts of the country, there are other parts of the country where we are still double-digit down from peak. Those areas include Chicago and Atlanta. So in terms of where we are for the cycle, you can\u2019t look at the averages because the averages will kill you. You have to look at the market. And when you look at the market, we see real opportunity for continued improvement. There\u2019s really interesting statistics that comes out of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies and they call it the leading indicator of remodeling activity. And this leading indicator of remodeling activity suggests continued growth throughout the fourth quarter, throughout 2017. They don\u2019t produce the report past 2017 but their work suggests we will continue to grow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe a good follow up here would be you guys have rolled out a couple of key offerings to better serve the Pro including credit and advanced delivery options. I know it\u2019s very early, but do you think that\u2019s playing a role in driving big ticket and the strength we saw this quarter? And do you think these options are driving in maybe a different customer or changing behavior within the store?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you said, we\u2019re still in the process of rolling out, it\u2019s early days. We have not completed the rollout of BODFS, our Buy Online, Deliver from Store, yet we\u2019re now up to about 1,600 stores where we\u2019ve launched the program. As I mentioned in my comments, we\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in deliveries. So certainly we think that that is beginning to have a positive impact and making it easier for our Pro customers as well as DIY customers to engage and shop with The Home Depot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the credit side, it\u2019s important to note that we have little over 900,000 Pros that hold a private label credit card with us. We\u2019ve converted over 20% of those Pros onto our new value product. And for those who have converted, 64% of those are activating the new value prop. So we see growth in those accounts. And as we continue to convert and add new Pros into the program, we expect this to be a top line benefit. Today, it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s not materially impacting the top line but it\u2019s growing and we expect that to continue to grow over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s great color. That\u2019s very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question will come from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning, everybody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I wanted to follow up on the hurricane. The $100 dollars of sales related to storms, is that hurricane and flooding combined? And just related to the hurricane, can you talk about how much the hurricane lifted the month of October in the U.S.?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The number is both in total. Candidly, the flooding has been an impact throughout the entire quarter and a larger driver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was the biggest part of that $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Interesting. So the hurricane lift to October actually sounds like it was certainly \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about 50 basis points for the quarter and most of that being related to flooding then maybe 50, 70 basis points of lift to the month of October simply from the hurricane?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not that much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just the timing of the hurricane and where it hit; not that much. We saw significant cost coming of the flooding. In fact, I think you know we had to shut down a store, we lost a store. Part of those storm-related expenses I called out on the SG&amp;A line is because we had a \u2013 it could liquidate the inventory, clean up the store and get it back open which we did do, which is very exciting for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the flooding happened at the end of Q2. So the flooding impact was the entire quarter and was a much bigger impact. Obviously, the hurricane was in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. And then one of the questions that we\u2019re getting is how you\u2019re thinking about or what\u2019s implied in the fourth quarter related to annual guidance? I think some of the more skeptical investors out there are saying, hey look, you know, Home Depot is sort of implying EPS and comps below where the street is sitting for the fourth quarter. So can you talk about how you thought about approaching the guidance on the year and then how you thought about addressing those questions to investors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the easiest way to think about this is on a two-year stack basis. So the implied comp for the fourth quarter is a little over 3%. If you look at a three-year stack for the first half of 2016, the two-year stack comp is 10.6%. If you look at the two-year stack comp for Q3, it\u2019s 10.6%. If you look then at the forecasted two-year stack comp for Q4, it\u2019s over 10%. So skepticism abound, but we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we give based on these two-year stack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, guys. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to poke a little bit more thinking about the environment going forward. Obviously, we had a big election and the market has taken off. But as we think about your business, obviously Pro has grown pretty fast but we have SG&amp;A maybe growing about 50% of sales I think is what\u2019s been said. So as we kind of think about the construct of '17 and beyond and knowing that there\u2019s a lot of dry powder in the housing market, how do you guys think about your growth rate as we move out of the fourth quarter which has got a lot of noise and go into '17 and '18? Do you think we\u2019re at the end of the cycle or could this cycle be a lot different?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first comment I\u2019d make, obviously we\u2019re not prepared to talk about '17. We\u2019ll do that on our next call. But what I would say is if you look at the drivers of growth, we don\u2019t see significant change in the drivers of growth. We\u2019ve had foundational GDP growth. We\u2019ve had in housing home value appreciation, housing turnover, new household formation and then layer on top of that 65% of the housing stock in the U.S. is now in excess of 30 years old. All of those are drivers of business for us. There\u2019s nothing that would indicate that we see that those would change. And as Carol said, there\u2019s varying degrees of recovery amongst different parts of the country. So we don\u2019t see anything on the horizon at this stage that would say anything should change in terms of the growth drivers in our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if you recall the investor conference we had in December of last year, we set forth a sales target of $101 million and operating margin target of 14.5% by 2018. As we sit here today, nothing has taken us off of that target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess I was even thinking the more bullish side, could we \u2013 the recovery we\u2019ve called it a zombie economy, growth cession, we\u2019ve had a lot of different of words we\u2019ve used for it. Is it conceivable as you look at your business over the last three or four years that it\u2019s been obviously very good but a better environment, a better macro environment could drive growth higher? And have you guys thought about that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s possible but we\u2019re focused on the numbers that Carol just shared that we\u2019ve laid out in our investor conference. That\u2019s roughly $12 billion plus worth of growth between now and 2018 from where we started this year and that\u2019s the equivalent of opening 357 new Home Depot stores which we won\u2019t do. So that\u2019s no small hill and we\u2019re focused on achieving those numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The good thing is, Scott, we got a supply chain, we got a staffing model, we can adopt or change or adjust to whatever demand is coming our way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just one \u2013 thank you for that. Just one clarification. Was the Pro growth sequentially, is it sequentially speeding up? And then I\u2019ll yield. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Pro growth was higher than the DIY growth in the third quarter but the sequential comment had to do with transactions not customer segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Following up on some commentary, Craig, you were making about big ticket, so we know it was very strong and I think you called out appliances, flooring and roofing and that you\u2019ve always try to gauge the balance of it. I guess for those categories to have been strong in Q3, how should we gauge the sustainability of those? Appliances seems to have been a share gaining category, it\u2019s been good for a while, it\u2019s probably a big fourth quarter category. Is flooring and roofing more weather dependent or is that more seasonal, or is it lasting?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Roofing obviously can be seasonal depending on what happens. If you get ice and snow, you\u2019re not really repairing \u2013 you might repair but you won\u2019t replace a roof. Flooring is less seasonal overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then as a follow up I guess to thinking about, I think Carol you talked about looking at individual markets that there\u2019s still some room to go. Can you distill a little further? You gave us geographic color by market. Can you talk about any performance? I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s oil markets, rural markets, any disparities on a regional level sort of beneath the geographic data that you provide, better or worse, that you could gauge the overall environment with?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, in certain geographies like Texas where you may say that how the sale is performing there? We see double-digit comps in parts of Texas. So Texas is doing very well. I will tell you our stores in North Dakota are negative comping; two stores in North Dakota, so that\u2019s not a surprise to us. It doesn\u2019t matter to the overall company but that\u2019s not a surprise. On balance, as Craig pointed out, we\u2019ve got good growth across the country with opportunity for more growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the way you look at pent-up demand you\u2019ve shown us categories that have not reached their full potential. Do you look at your markets that way? Can you share any color about the number of our markets where we don\u2019t think the housing market or our business has gotten back to let\u2019s say some normalized demand level or has potential to keep going?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we do look at it that way and as we\u2019ve look peak to [indiscernible] markets that have not fully recovered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll now hear from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot and good morning to you. First question should be a fairly simple one. You gave us the comp for the big ticket bucket. Can you give us the small ticket and then we can solve for the rest of the business please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Under 50, Matt, was 1.6% comp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, understood. And then secondly, you talked about share gains. You spoke about particularly categories like appliances which are more DIY focused. Can you give us a sense of the pace of share gains that you\u2019re seeing in Pro and perhaps some of the categories that might be standing out from that perspective? And your sense I guess as part of that as to how the Pro market looks today from a growth perspective relative to DIY?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say the Pro is very strong. One thing we saw this quarter is we\u2019ve always talked about the high-spend Pro and the low-spend Pro. The low-spend Pro comp was on par with the high-spend Pro. So that\u2019s nice to see not only geographical but the high and low spend are each comping at that stronger rate in consumer. And as we look across departments, virtually every department had higher Pro spend comp than consumer. So the Pro is strong across the business. We continue to be extremely pleased with our lumber, building material business. Our tool business in particular just continues to accelerate and we\u2019re taking meaningful share in the tools business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And presumably we can tie to some degree that migration to Pro with the overall strong performance were the bigger ticket baskets for you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Fassler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you so much for that detail. I appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll continue on to Dan Binder with Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Daniel Binder</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. A few questions. First, August stood out as sort of a softer month. Was there anything in particular that you would highlight there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was an extremely warm month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Daniel Binder</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then in the appliance business, it looked like the industry as well as you were a little bit more aggressive year-over-year. I suspect it may be in part to what you highlighted earlier just in terms of wanting to take share. But I was curious what your feelings were about the health of the appliance industry given what we\u2019ve heard from vendors and what you see in your own business. In other words, is it taking higher promotions to drive that comp?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, our promotional cadence is almost identical to last year and we see the strength in our portfolio across all of our brands and very, very strong across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Daniel Binder</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly on holiday, the holiday business every year that business seems to get bigger and I was just curious how you\u2019ve ordered for this year? Is it up \u2013 are orders up double digit, what are you expecting in terms of the contribution to the fourth quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it\u2019s a big business and a growing business. It\u2019s still for the quarter not a determinative business for us. But yes, we bought into that. That was part of our growth in inventory and we\u2019re expecting another great holiday season. I\u2019d say also on the back of our Halloween and Harvest, we bought into that as well this past year. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the performance of that deck of holiday segment and looking forward to an equally strong Christmas period as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Daniel Binder</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank has our next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. So I just wanted to follow up on the Pro and can you estimate for us what you think your share of the Pro business is compared to your share of DIY? And eventually what do you think you could gain in terms of share for the Pro business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So share around the Pro is a little bit elusive but again, we try to triangulate on the number. I think what we\u2019ve looked at is we\u2019re playing now in a $550 billion market with the addition of the MRO for hospitality, institutional and multifamily. We think total share for The Home Depot plays somewhere in the 15% range inclusive of all of Pro and DIY and services, and we believe that our DIY share is sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of 27% to 28%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And so we back into Pro being about 10% given the penetration --?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">10% or 12% give or take, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. And then a couple of other follow-ups. Promotional cadence, you said you were relatively similar but what have you seen from any of your competitors? And particularly on appliances, one of the big vendors had pretty strong appliance units but very low dollars because of mix and pricing. So I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing any of your competitors be irrational, because that\u2019s something that I think has impacted you guys in the past when some competitors got a little irrational with appliances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I would say appliance is included but our entire Q4 cadence is identical. I can\u2019t think of anything that were meaningfully different from Q4 of last year. I would say broadly across the business in portfolio and categories, we are focused on offering an everyday low price to our Pro and consumer customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So that\u2019s your offering. You\u2019re not seeing anything irrational from competitors I guess is the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Time to time, folks run promotions; they try to drive their business. That\u2019s just the nature of the business these days and we see that. We see that with the competition but we\u2019re going to work hard to try to remain focused on our everyday value for our customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. Thanks for the color.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll continue on to Dennis McGill with Zelman &amp; Associates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dennis McGill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Carol, one question on the inventory side; I think obviously last quarter you mentioned some error in the algorithm and just curious if you could update us there as far as where you guys are on the in-stock? And then more broadly just how you\u2019re thinking about inventory management now and in the future? We\u2019ve heard a lot of suppliers talk about inventory adjustments, the big customers and curious if you feel that to be somewhat tied to just the end market of point of sale or if that\u2019s more strategy on the distribution side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I talk about some of the inventory findings. First, our in-stock rates are a tick higher than they were year-on-year. That\u2019s exactly where we want them to be. We bought in for the season, so our inventory is healthy. We are ready for this season. The quality of inventory has never been better. If I look at clearance, in active, e-velocity, we\u2019re at the lowest levels in the 21 years that I\u2019ve been here. So never better in terms of quality. And in terms of where we think the inventory may go, we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives on the way in the supply chain roles and maybe Mark Holifield could comment on Supply Chain Sync and so on and so forth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Holifield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We\u2019re pleased with the results of the Supply Chain Sync, certainly pleased right now with the state of our inventory. As Carol outlined, a tick higher than last year, well prepared for Q4 and we\u2019ve increased our JLQs for our Pro customers a bit. In terms of Sync, we continue to roll that out. The way to think about that, our RDC network handles about half of our cost to goods sold. We\u2019re live in two-thirds of our RDCs at this point with about two-thirds of the COGS, the cost of goods sold, dollar volume through there. We will be rolling to the north RDCs here as we go through the next several months and that will complete the rollout in terms of the RDCs, and then we\u2019ll continue to roll to other vendors as we continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the most important thing as it relates to inventory, obviously we look for productivity but first and foremost is we\u2019re looking to continually improve our overall in-stock position and be able to take care of the customers\u2019 needs in the quantities that they need.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dennis McGill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then second question just as it relates to both Canada and Mexico I guess kind of different impacts going on, but hoping you can maybe speak to the fundamental backdrop in Canada with housing market looking a little bit weaker there, just what you\u2019re seeing as far as your performance, whether that\u2019s share gain or maybe we shouldn\u2019t be worried about some of the housing metrics? And then in Mexico under the new administration, any thoughts as how it could impact your business with policy or immigration reform, et cetera?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, let me start with Mexico. Obviously, there have been changes in Mexico over the years. We\u2019ve been able to drive an unbelievable performance in Mexico through all those changes and we\u2019ll continue to see us doing that. We\u2019re very pleased with our business in Mexico. The team has done a phenomenal job down there of growing that business and positioning us as the largest home improvement retailer in Mexico. As it relates to Canada, clearly what you\u2019ve seen in Canada and what we\u2019ve experienced is in the province of Alberta, in Saskatchewan where more dependent upon energy, clearly we have seen fresher there that we haven\u2019t seen in the balance of the country. But the team has worked hard to offset that pressure and grow the business overall. And we\u2019re very pleased with our business in Canada and the team has done an amazing job to offset that pressure in the West.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dennis McGill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you, guys. Good luck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question, and this I know is a really big picture and early. But with the change in administration here in the United States, any initial thoughts as to how you\u2019re thinking at Home Depot how the shifting political landscape could impact your company?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our job is to stay focused on our customer to make sure that we\u2019re driving the most convenient interconnected experience leveraging all the asset base that we have and that we\u2019re driving value for our customers through great values and through great innovation. That is our sole focus. It\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. It\u2019s what we need to stay in tune with so that we stay relevant to our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. I appreciate that. And then secondly on the \u2013 I know there\u2019s been other questions on appliance as well, but my question here is it seems as though just watching a wide number of \u2013 a large number of retailers that more and more chains of various sizes are pushing into this business. So with that I guess I\u2019m asking are you seeing increased competition from other retailers pushing into the business. And if so, what form is that taking and have you had to change or are you considering changing how you go to market in appliance as a result of that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, there are obviously more folks jumping into this business. But again, as Ted described, we have a very strong appliance business. We\u2019re gaining share in the category. We like our model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we\u2019ve not seen an impact from new entrants and we don\u2019t envision any change to our go to market strategy on appliances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, guys. Carol, I wanted to go back to one of your earlier comments regarding market-by-market differences. Yes we know that some markets haven\u2019t necessarily recovered from a home price perspective, but we actually have seen pretty rapid home price appreciation in other markets. And at least in pockets, we\u2019re starting to hear about some pricing pressure in some of those. So I guess the question is, are there some high, let\u2019s call it, home appreciation markets where you\u2019re starting to see any flowing in big ticket sales?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so I actually looked at that this morning. I went to the San Francisco Bay area and I went to Seattle, because those are two markets where you\u2019re seeing real home price appreciation. And I went to see how we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in big ticket or anything that would cause us to be concerned, and we don\u2019t see anything at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got you. Okay. And then just quickly shifting to gross margin, I know you previously talked about gross margin expansion in the back half of this year. Maybe I just had the cadence a bit wrong, but I guess I would have expected some modest expansion in 3Q. Was there anything else that may have impacted the gross margin that you didn\u2019t already cite? And has your outlook for 4Q changed at all?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. We were very pleased with our gross margin performance in the third quarter. We expanded by 6 basis points. And based on the guidance I had given you, you should expect similar expansion in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Roger that. All right, thanks guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is around trade up and trade down. Have you guys seen any trends in consumers trading up to more expensive products with Interline or trading down for that matter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s something we watch and have given color on previously and we see a similar trend where our comps are strong across the value line with higher comps in the higher price point goods. And we think that is a lot driven by innovation in the fabulous product that we\u2019re bringing to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, if you think about the two products in power tools that Ted called out in his comments, those are unbelievable innovations that clearly help drive ticket within the category and expansion of benefits for the customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And in terms of big projects that consumers are doing, are we seeing bigger tickets associated with those projects as they prefer more expensive items to complete them?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You can look at our services business and our services business up year-on-year. We exited a few businesses at the end of last year. If you ignore the businesses that you exited, our services business which has an average ticket north of $1,000 grew faster than the company average in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Basham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. I have two questions. I think one is just a follow-up, Carol, on Interline in that last comment. So if we look at Interline, could you give us the impact on SG&amp;A in the quarter and also just how that business is going? Presumably it\u2019s also growing faster than the company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Interline contributed $300 million of growth year-on-year. The gross margin [ph] obviously impacted the gross margin. And in terms of EPS, we generated $0.02 of EPS off of Interline in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what did it do into SG&amp;A?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was pressure. It was in the overall guidance that we gave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so we\u2019ll back into that. And EPS was slightly accretive?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, about $0.02.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then my real question sort of ties back to the SG&amp;A. I think you mentioned that given rising wage pressures and other costs that we should go forward thinking about 50% growth of sales into 2017 and perhaps beyond. How should we think of that? Is it simply if sales are growing 5% that we should assume SG&amp;A dollars grow 2.5%, or is there like a baseline that it grows and then it\u2019s 50% of a comp above that or am I thinking about it too much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re thinking about it too much, because our \u2013 our largest expense is payroll and we have an activity-based model. And so we have so much opportunity to adjust to the payroll staffing out of our stores. So just use 50%. Will it be perfect? No, but it\u2019s good enough for modeling purposes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And so that\u2019s more of just letting us know that the fourth quarter where SG&amp;A really isn\u2019t going to grow, as a comparison issue we shouldn\u2019t use that as a new trend. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Exactly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then last, if I could sneak one in, the Pro side of the business if we were to disaggregate it and think about the buckets that were driving it, I think in the beginning, Craig, you mentioned a few different things. The new credit offer was last but delivery was focused. Could you give us any highlights there like, Carol, you did on the credit as to how the delivery tick-up is doing and how you see the customer changing as they do that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, we\u2019re now rolled out with a new delivery program in about 1,600 stores and again, we\u2019ve seen double-digit growth in deliveries. Now all of that is incremental. We think roughly 50% of that is incremental sales growth, but clearly some customers are taking up on the offer that we might have picked it up before as well. We anticipated that that would happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And how many of your Pros do you think have used it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That I don\u2019t know.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregory Melich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks. Good luck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Diane Dayhoff</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have time for one more question, Catherine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, ma\u2019am. We\u2019ll go to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Keith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for letting me in. Great quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Keith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was curious on the recent step up in mortgage rates the last couple of days, if you have any thought on how that may or may not impact your business and maybe even making some comparisons back to 2013 when we saw another sharp rate increase?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So we look at the affordability index, which is over 150%, so that\u2019s good news. So now we went back and looked at, okay, historical percentages of household income used for mortgage payments. If you look at the years 1995 through 2000, 22% of homeowners\u2019 income was used for their mortgage payment. It\u2019s down now to about 14%. Interest rates could go up to 7% and no one is suggesting that will happen. But interest rates can go up to 7% and we would be back to about 22% of household income used for mortgage payment. So we got a long way to go before there\u2019s any impact we think to our business from rising interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Keith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s interesting. Thank you. And maybe last for me, it\u2019s interesting that mix was at gross margin positive. I guess we\u2019re not used to seeing that in your business. Could you talk about what happened there and is that something that we might see going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we had higher penetration of certain categories that had higher margin not because their retails went up but because we took cost out. I think we\u2019ve talked to you in the past that we stood up a cost-out team that works with our merchants, and we really do try to drive productivity in our cost of goods sold. So it was that dynamic of a higher penetration in categories with cost out that really gave us the margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Peter Keith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carol Tom\u00e9</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Diane Dayhoff</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thank you everyone today for joining us. We look forward to talking with your on February for our fourth quarter earnings call. Talk to you then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.
