Today we announced results for the first quarter, and we\u2019re off to another good start. Our sales growth was strong and right on target, coming in at 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, and ongoing earnings per share of $0.63 exceeded our previous guidance range. Our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.15 to $3.25 remains unchanged and reflects mid-teens growth at the midpoint on a constant currency basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we\u2019ve discussed previously, our emphasis today is on organic execution in the company. Today, all of our businesses have positive long-term outlooks and are well positioned with excellent products and attractive markets. At the start of the year, we issued guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter we\u2019re right on track with those expectations. We\u2019re particularly pleased with the exceptional performance of several long-term growth drivers that are leading the way, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, and the Alinity systems. These life-changing technologies are positively impacting lives and achieving impressive results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Brian, and I\u2019ll start with diagnostics where sales were led by core laboratory growth of 10%. Alinity, our family of next-generation diagnostics systems is driving strong growth internationally and we continue to achieve significant above-market growth in the United States. In Europe, we are both converting existing customers to Alinity and winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. We also recently increased our launch efforts for Alinity H, our hematology system, and obtained a CE Mark for Alinity M, our highly automated molecular diagnostic system, along with several infectious disease tests, and we\u2019re expanding our menu of tests in key markets such as China and the United States. With a steady menu expansion on multiple different instruments across geographies, Alinity will be a significant growth driver for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In nutrition, sales increased more than 6.5% in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and new product introductions. We continue to see good underlying market demand and growth and we\u2019re achieving above market growth in several geographies, particularly Asia and Latin America. Sales growth this quarter was balanced cross our pediatric and adult nutrition businesses with our core leading brands of Similac, Pediasure, and Ensure all contributing to strong growth overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In established pharmaceuticals, sales growth of 5.5% was right in line with our expectations and was a sequential improvement quarter to quarter. Performance in the quarter was led by 7.5% growth in our key emerging markets, which represent the most attractive long-term growth countries for our branded generics portfolio and include India, Brazil, Russia and China, along with several other emerging countries. Underlying growth dynamics in these countries continue to remain strong and intact. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, I\u2019ll cover medical devices where sales grew nearly 10%, led by strong double-digit growth in heart failure, structural heart, electro-physiology, and diabetes care. In heart failure, growth of 23% was led by rapid U.S. market adoption of our HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device following FDA approval of a long-term use indication late last year. The superior patient outcomes demonstrated in the clinical trial that supported this approval have been a critical component of the growth and the share capture that we\u2019re achieving. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In structural heart, several products across our broad portfolio contributed to strong double-digit growth in the quarter, including MitraClip, our market-leading device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, a condition caused by a leaky heart valve. During the quarter, we announced U.S. FDA approval for a new expanded indication for MitraClip which significantly expands the number of people that can be treated. The formal process seeking Medicare reimbursement for this new indication has been initiated. During the quarter, we also filed for CE Mark for our new TriClip device, a first of its kind minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. We plan to initiate our U.S. pivotal trial for TriClip in the coming months. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll wrap up with diabetes care, where sales grew over 40% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, or CGM. Libre continues to perform exceptionally well with worldwide sales of $380 million in the quarter, reflecting growth of 80%. In a relatively short amount of time, Libre has achieved global leadership among CGM systems for both Type 1 and Type 2 users. In order to meet the tremendous demand that we\u2019re seeing for Libre, we\u2019re adding a significant amount of new manufacturing capacity which will come online starting in the second half of this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, we\u2019re right on track with our high expectations to start the year. All of our long-term growth drivers are intact and achieving significant growth, including FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip and Alinity, and we\u2019re well positioned to achieve the top tier sales and EPS growth targets that we set at the beginning of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Brian?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brian Yoor</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis which is consistent with our previous guidance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our results, sales for the first quarter increased 7.1% and exchange had a negative impact of 4.8% on sales versus the prior year. Reported sales increased 2% in the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding other aspects of the P&amp;L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.6% of sales, adjusted R&amp;D investment was 7.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was 32.3% of sales. All of these rations were in line with previous guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our outlook for the full year, we continue to forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current exchange rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 2.5% on our full year reported sales, with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses. We continue to forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 29.5% of sales for the full year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our outlook for the second quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81 which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of around 7% and at current rates we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 4% on our second quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59% of sales, adjusted R&amp;D investment of a little less than 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of around 29.5% of sales. Lastly, we forecast net interest expense of around $150 million in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our second quarter sales growth outlook by business. For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid-single digit growth which is comprised of mid to high single digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales which reflects the recent continuation of a non-core low margin supply agreement. In nutrition, we forecast mid single digit sales growth. In diagnostics, we forecast Abbott\u2019s legacy diagnostics business, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and point of care, to grow mid to high single digits. In rapid diagnostics, we forecast low to mid single digit sales growth. In medical devices, we forecast high single digit sales growth which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of this business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, we will now open the call for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It was encouraging to see a lot of the big growth drivers here stay on track and really drive healthy double-digit growth. I was wondering if you could spend some time on each of those and specifically address Libre - I think a lot of investors are anticipating Libre 2 and other enhancements that you could make there in addition to all the capacity you\u2019re adding. Can you talk about the pathway for Libre and some of the other big growth drivers?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure Matt, thank you. I think I would say a couple things first before I focus just on Libre. We\u2019re seeing strength across the board in a lot of device and diagnostic areas. There is a geography here and there or a product line here and there that we might not be completely satisfied with, but I think if you look at us, our product areas, even competitors in various spaces in medical devices, this whole sector is doing pretty well and the growth rates have improved in a number of cases. I know that there was a lot of pre-earnings noise out there about the continuity of the med device sector. I have to tell you from my perspective, I see nothing but a strong sector going forward. While we\u2019ve got great pipelines and great products, I think the entire sector has a bright future ahead of it here, and the markets are all pretty attractive for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So first of all, I think we\u2019re in a much healthier environment than might be reflected right now, and I think a lot of companies are actually doing really well in that environment. There\u2019s a lot of good new products and pipelines out there. I think the whole thing is pretty healthy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then specifically to us, we\u2019ve got in our case, I think, great pipeline, great new products and launches in many of the segments and sectors we\u2019re in. To focus on diabetes care as a start, that\u2019s been a particular bright spot where clearly new technology and affordable technology has made a very big difference in life for diabetics, both Type 1 and Type 2 worldwide. Libre has been a pretty powerful leader in that segment on all counts and all points. We\u2019ve been pretty enthused about its success, its uptake, its reception by patients all over the world. In a fairly short amount of time, we\u2019ve achieved global leadership in terms of continuous glucose monitoring in both Type 1 and Type 2. I think part of the attraction to patients is obviously to not have to finger stick, the information, the continuous nature of it. The way it allows diabetics to manage their health and manage diabetes has been life changing, and that\u2019s been reflected. I think very importantly, it\u2019s been affordable to a degree that it\u2019s become a very broadly accessible technology, which was our intent with it. It\u2019s got a unique ease of use and it\u2019s got appeal for any kind of patient, so I think that\u2019s pretty important and it\u2019s reflected in the reimbursement worldwide. Eighty percent of sales are now reimbursed internationally over 30 countries, well over half of U.S. lives commercially--commercial lives are covered, so we\u2019re seeing a lot of support for the product in all ways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve mentioned a number of times that we\u2019ve invested heavily in capacity expansion - that is correct. We\u2019ve put significant investment into that, and as we\u2019ve noted a couple of times, the first waves of that come online in the second half of this year, and then there\u2019s a steady cadence of capacity expansions underway that will come online sequentially after that. There won\u2019t be any constraints to the growth that is possible there. I think it\u2019s going to be a very different kind of device or diagnostic product than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Because there are so many millions of diabetics worldwide, this is not an niche product, not for Type 1s or Type 2s. There\u2019s not a niche here, there is a massive population around the world that needs to manage diabetes, and this product will be broadly accessible to all of them, so it calls for quite a lot of capacity. In the second half of this year, that will be initiated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have a number of things we\u2019re expecting and waiting for. You asked about Libre 2 - that is under review at the FDA. We have filed Libre 2 with alarms in the U.S. as an ICGM. We\u2019re not going to forecast FDA review timelines, but we clearly have expectations to achieve that milestone. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m trying to think of what else to tell you about that. It\u2019s already on the market in Europe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That was very comprehensive, and I\u2019ll give you a second to think there. I think the one follow-up I had was just on Libre 2. You mentioned ICGMs. Can you talk about your confidence in your ability to get that? I also wanted to ask about the payor dynamics. Before last call, you talked about some preferential co-pays. Can you talk about any developments that you\u2019re seeing on the payor side in terms of support for Libre?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll tell you what - I\u2019ll let our Chief Operating Officer, who\u2019s come from that business, answer that question for you. Robert?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so on Libre 2 specifically in the U.S., the filing of ICGM, I\u2019ll just say we know what the ICGM standards are, we know what needs to be achieved, and we filed in the U.S. as an ICGM knowing what the standards need to be achieved. So we look at what we filed and we look at the standards, we look at what we filed and we know that we meet those standards, so to Miles\u2019 point, we\u2019re not going to forecast as to when that approval will come through, but I think it\u2019s clear in terms of what we filed and why we filed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding payors specifically in the U.S, I think that what we\u2019ve always intended for this product is to remove some of the hurdles, and affordability was one of those. If you look at a lot of the evolution of the reimbursement here in the U.S. that\u2019s slowly moving from something that was with a lot of prior authorizations, only going through mail order, to now looking very much like the blood glucose monitoring market, where we start to see less prior authorizations, formulary positions that are allowing patients to go to pharmacy and pick that up. A lot of our managed care strategy was focused on driving that shift, and a key part of that is the access and affordability, so we\u2019re seeing that in our managed care coverage. As Miles said, we\u2019re over 50% now of managed care life coverage in this patient population, and you see the shift into pharmacy. If you look at the script data, total Rxs, you can see that shift, you can see that occurring with Libre, and that was a very intentional strategy to accelerate adoption, specifically in the U.S., by going to pharmacy, which is something that hadn\u2019t been done before with CGM systems. We did that, and we\u2019re starting to kind of move that category into the pharmacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Matt, I know you guys like data that you can track publicly. You can track that every week, and we\u2019ve been pretty pleased with the performance going through pharmacy. The patient acquisition and so forth continues to be obviously strong - frankly, right in line with our growth rates around the world as you\u2019d expect, because we\u2019re not trying to drive price here, we\u2019re trying to drive the volume and acquisition of patients. Obviously that\u2019s going pretty strongly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s nothing but happiness about this product, I can tell you. We\u2019re pretty happy with it. It\u2019s doing really well. I actually think we\u2019re kind of in its early stages, and at this point there\u2019s over a million Type 1 users of Libre around the world and those only make up two-thirds of our user base, so with this kind of a growth rate, that kind of a user base, with the capacity expansion coming online we\u2019re obviously expecting this to be a continually big and bigger product for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for all the color, and congrats.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, just a couple questions from me, one more broadly for Miles and then maybe a quick follow-up. Miles, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019d share with us how you see the pacing of the year from here. I think in the fourth quarter, the messaging was core growth drivers very much intact, some one-off dynamics were suppressing growth and you expected that growth to improve in the first quarter, and sure enough that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s happened here, we\u2019re back in sort of the 7% range. As you think about the balance of the year, you have these core growth drivers doing relatively well, a couple of businesses probably not performing where you\u2019d like them to perform, so how do we think about the pacing of the business from the first quarter on, given some of these very solid businesses and some of the businesses that are not performing as you\u2019d like?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, a couple of sort of baseline comments there. Every year, we go into the year and the gating of earnings per share for any given quarter tends to start out lower at the front end of the year and it always look back-end loaded, toward the third and fourth quarters. I\u2019d say increasingly that\u2019s leveling a little bit in that it\u2019s still a climb as the year goes on, but in our case it\u2019s reflecting growth in penetration of new products. There\u2019s a couple of seasonalities in there, but they\u2019re not big enough to really affect the overall earnings profile. We\u2019ve increasingly seen stronger and stronger first quarters, but to be honest, third and fourth is always strong but it\u2019s driven right now by the incredible growth of Alinity, Libre, HeartMate, MitraClip. There is so much real growth in the new products that are launching that it just gets better and better as the year rolls on. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s always hard to gate to the penny - we try to get our estimates to a point like that, then we\u2019re always subject to a couple of lumpy comparisons to whatever happened last year and so on, I guess because it looks optically weird when it\u2019s bumpy. But the fact is the growth is steady. As you said, it\u2019s not only intact, it\u2019s strong, but there are a couple of places you could poke at and say, okay, you must not be satisfied with that, and I\u2019d say yeah, you\u2019re right about that. But while we\u2019ve got some places we\u2019re putting a lot more focus on and we\u2019ve obviously miscalled the pace of improvement, I\u2019d say in general I\u2019m glad that what we have to work on for improvement is where it is and not in these major growth drivers. So you know, Alinity is performing strongly, we are winning over 95% of accounts where we already have the business and we\u2019re winning almost two-thirds of the accounts where we\u2019re head to head with an entrenched competitor. That\u2019s pretty powerful data when you consider that customers have to switch out mainframe systems, it\u2019s a big commitment, it takes months, they\u2019re long term contracts. So to be winning almost two-thirds of those new business, new accounts, that\u2019s pretty significant. That\u2019s a pretty powerful endorsement by the market of the Alinity systems and the laboratory solutions we\u2019re offering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re seeing an improvement in growth just about every place. I\u2019m really pleased with nutrition. I\u2019ve had to sit here on this call a number of times and explain, well, we\u2019re expecting to get a little better, but it\u2019s performing really well and I think consistently so across all geographies and across both major product lines there. That\u2019s been nice story, and we\u2019ve estimated to you that the growth rate of that business going forward, we would look for in the 4% to 6% range, and obviously we\u2019re a little beyond that. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to constantly be beyond that, but that 4% to 6% range is all good so anywhere in there is pretty good for us. There does tend to be some up and down with it in some countries depending on holidays and seasons and so forth, but overall if we\u2019re not watching it week to week, that\u2019s a pretty strong business right now and we like what we see. The management\u2019s done a great job worldwide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as far as quarters coming, I\u2019m hard pressed to find a lot of things to point as watch-outs, other than as you pointed out, we\u2019ve got a couple of places where we think we\u2019ve got work to do to improve the performance of the business. I\u2019m pleased that we can show that we know how to correct the performance of an underperforming business, but as you would probably rightly point out to me right now, there\u2019s a couple that are taking longer than I might have guessed. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s very helpful as we think about the balance of the year. I guess my follow-up would just be the other major growth driver investors are focused on is MitraClip. By our math, it looks the U.S. business accelerated for MitraClip even before the NCD, and I wonder if you could just, a, talk about time of the NCD, what you\u2019re seeing the U.S. and then you had this other study, MitraFR in the European business, and our sense on diligence is that\u2019s maybe suppressing some performance ex-U.S., so maybe time of the NCD, U.S. trends, and what you\u2019re seeing ex-U.S. and outlook for the year. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, I\u2019m going to have Robert take that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so yes, we had a very good quarter in structural heart and we showed growth across many of our different franchises and geographies. Obviously MitraClip was a big driver and we\u2019re right where we wanted to be with MitraClip. The FDA approval was a few months ahead, but I think that speaks to the data and the evidence that was generated through COAPT. Label is very much in line with our expectations and reflects the COAPT patient enrollment criteria, so we\u2019re now obviously working on CMS. The process is underway. These usually take between six to nine months. If you look at our experience when we achieved the primary MR reimbursement indication a few years back, that took us about 7.5 months from when we started to when we got it approved. We know how to do this, we\u2019re currently in the process, and it will just be a little bit difficult to forecast here but we\u2019re very optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I\u2019d say reimbursement is only one of the building blocks. It\u2019s definitely an important building block but it\u2019s not the only one to really think about this business as a multi-year, double-digit kind of growth driver for us. There are other building blocks here that are very important that we\u2019re currently already underway. Opening of new centers is a key aspect here, and the timing and the framework and the cycle of how we do that is important. We have currently about 350 implanting centers in the U.S. and I think over the next few years, we\u2019ll see that number get to about 550. There\u2019s a lot of training that\u2019s involved here also - sales force training, center training, implanter training, and if you look at a sales rep, it will usually take them between six to nine months until they get fully proficient on MitraClip, and then there\u2019s obviously the development, support and sustaining of a patient referral network as we build awareness of the therapy and the technology amongst the physician groups and ensure that those get funneled into our implant centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So those are some of the key blocks, but I\u2019d say we know how to do this. We\u2019ve been doing it in the U.S. for the last four years and we\u2019re not going to wait for final CMS approval before we start hiring. We\u2019re already hiring more reps, we\u2019re expanding our sales force, we\u2019re expanding our clinical specialists so that we\u2019re going to be ready to go, so we\u2019re definitely taking an invest ahead approach here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I like our position. The mitral is a tremendous opportunity, an unmet need and an opportunity for Abbott, and quite frankly we\u2019ve been--you know, this position didn\u2019t happen just because of COAPT. We\u2019ve been building this position for over a decade, so whether it\u2019s mitral repair or mitral replacement, we\u2019re in a pretty unique position. I do see kind of sequential growth as we go through the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your question on MitraFR - yes, we did see that impact some of our European markets. That was a French study, so it did have a little bit of an impact on some of the implanting rates in some key European markets, but I think that\u2019s more of a transition thing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fundamental change in the market in Europe, and we have expanded internationally to other large opportunities. Japan is another market where we see a very large opportunity for us, so that is also going to help drive the growth. I think the MitraFR study will take another quarter or so to play out, but we do expect the international business to kind of continue its growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you and good morning. Just have two pretty direct questions here, one more to focus on the growth drivers. On Alinity, a question on the U.S. launch. When do you think we\u2019ll see the full impact of that launch in the U.S.? When does that really show up in results in a meaningful way? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, Bob, I\u2019d say show up, we expect to get the almost full menu by the end of this year. Now, that\u2019s kind of a running thing, and we don\u2019t want to put a whole lot of effort out until we\u2019ve got significant menu. We do have significant menu now, but we\u2019d like to get more of it approved and then go, so I think you\u2019ll start to see the U.S. show up in the numbers really in 2020, because even if we were launching now, I think you\u2019d be hard pressed to see it relative to the size of the business worldwide. We\u2019re growing at 9% right now in the U.S. without much emphasis on Alinity, so I\u2019d say you\u2019re probably going to see a measurable impact from it in 2020. But frankly, right now in the U.S., growth rate is pretty high even while we expand that menu.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. The other question I just wanted to ask, obviously you\u2019ve got a lot of growth drivers that are driving really strong results in devices overall. One thing that\u2019s been a little weak is on the neural mod side the last couple quarters. I guess my question on neural mod is do you think the weakness in the U.S. is related to a slower market at all or are these Abbott-specific issues, and when do you think we could expect a turn? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A good question. I kind of anticipated this one. This is the one where I\u2019m going to fall on my own sword for how fast I forecasted a turn here for us. There\u2019s clearly an Abbott issue here, our own management, which I\u2019ve said before, and I think I in particular have miscalled the pace at which we would turn our own performance, and where we underestimated that was we\u2019re expanding our sales force by 40% to 50% and that\u2019s been a little more disruptive than I think we had expected. But I\u2019m confident in the business, I\u2019m confident in the management, I\u2019m confident in the direction we\u2019re headed. I clearly wasn\u2019t right about the timing. So I\u2019m not worrying about it from the standpoint of boy, this business is really broken or hurt - it\u2019s not, so I have a lot of confidence about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as growth goes, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a high double digit grower, but it\u2019s a double digit grower, and I think in med devices and in some of these markets as they become established, to be maintaining a double-digit growth rate as a market segment, I think is pretty healthy. So we\u2019re not losing any confidence in these segments or the potential in the segment or the growth in the segment. I\u2019d put the growth sort of in that double digit range - that\u2019s what we would expect, and it\u2019s not 50% but it\u2019s not 5% either. Our performance in this particular segment is clearly underperforming what it should be, so I\u2019d say if you want to know if the market\u2019s slowing, it\u2019s not 50, but slow is a relative thing. I\u2019d take any double digit market, and I think this is a healthy market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you, and congrats on the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Miles, a couple product related questions, starting with rhythm management and heart failure. U.S. rhythm management was a little soft. Was that market related or Abbott specific? I understand you made some management changes there. How quickly can you turn that around?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Secondly on heart failure, that was obviously very strong. Could you talk about the sustainability of that? Thank you, and I have one follow-up. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I could talk about that, but I\u2019m going to hand it to Robert to talk about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so in our electro-physiology business, Larry, we definitely had a lower growth rate in the U.S. of about 6%, when international grew 20%. That\u2019s not a market thing; it\u2019s more of an Abbott as we get ready to launch. We\u2019re launching our new ablation catheter, TactiCath SC in the U.S., which we\u2019ve already launched OUS. We obviously saw some kind of inventory depletion of the older product in getting ready for the new product, so we expect that to get back to the double digit growth rate in the U.S. on the EP side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On CRM, that is definitely another area of disappointment and obviously focus for us. We\u2019ve shown some recovery in the international market, and I think the team there has done a good job at execution but we\u2019re not satisfied with our U.S. performance. It\u2019s an important business for us and we\u2019ve got to do better. What we\u2019ve seen internationally is where we\u2019ve deployed a dedicated EP and CRM team, the business does better. It does better in CRM and, quite frankly, it does better in EP. As you saw, we recently made some organizational changes her to sharpen our focus and create a more, I\u2019d say, standalone vertical business unit in CRM. We think that\u2019s going to get the accountability and the focus that we need out in the commercial field, especially in the U.S., and we\u2019ve got several new product innovations that are progressing very nicely, our next-gen ICD and our two leadless programs, and this structure will ensure they get the focus that they need. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In heart failure, as you mentioned, our sales were up 23%. U.S. was up 26% and that was the impact of, I\u2019d say, the rapid share capture that we achieved in the U.S. in the destination therapy, I\u2019d say a pretty strong execution of the commercial team with the product, achieving about 20 share points in that quarter. We expect that share to kind of maintain. The product has done very well, not only on our, let\u2019s say, traditional Abbott accounts but even in our competitor accounts, that\u2019s doing very nicely also. We think heart failure has got strong potential also through the year with cardio manage, which is a little bit smaller product here, but it also continues to do very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s very helpful. Just lastly for me, Miles, as you pay down more debt, we\u2019re starting to get more questions on capital allocation. Can you please provide us with your latest thoughts, especially as it relates to M&amp;A, when can we expect to see a pick-up in M&amp;A? Thanks for taking the questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome. Well, a couple things. First of all, I think the company has done a great job of paying down debt, cash management, cash generation, etc. It\u2019s been a little unprecedented, I think, for as much debt as we had. When we were done with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, I think we were at about $28 billion, something like that. We\u2019ve paid down more than 10 of that, so--and almost 8.5 of it just last year, another half a billion in the first quarter of this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our debt--you know, everybody watches net debt to EBITDA ratios. We\u2019re down to about 2x right now from what was, I think about 4.3 when we completed the second of the two acquisitions. That\u2019s a pretty rapid pay down. We expect to be about 1.5x by year-end, so I think I could declare strategic flexibility achieved. Obviously we want to keep paying down the debt. We\u2019ve got nice strong cash flow, we\u2019ve got a number of choices. We increased the dividend, as you know, back in December by 14%, and we tend to target that dividend at around 40% to 45% of EPS, and I think right now we\u2019re at 40%, something like that. EPS is growing pretty rapidly, so we\u2019ll probably be adjusting that at some point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But there is good times and bad times to purchase shares, as you know, and our share repurchases, we haven\u2019t done a lot of share repurchasing. We\u2019ve done some primarily just to offset dilution, but that has not been a big consumer of capital. We have made significant investments internally in our growth with Alinity expansion and with Libre capacity expansion, and again while those are important users of our capital with high return, we still have pretty strong cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So back to the point of your question, we have strategic flexibility, we have strong cash flow, we have choice. I think the question is whether or not at any point there\u2019s something out there that fits us or we\u2019re particularly interested in or that we\u2019re focused on, etc., and as you know, I\u2019ve told you in the past even if I had that, I wouldn\u2019t tell you - that would be true. I would say today, what is also true is we are very much focused on our internal organic execution, and that\u2019s getting 95% of our attention. We\u2019re not not paying attention to other opportunities. We always are tracking and monitoring other opportunities, but I have to tell you right now, I don\u2019t see a very robust target-rich environment out there. It\u2019s not target-rich, I don\u2019t think it is anyway, and I don\u2019t see a lot of meaningful adjunctive things that necessarily fit what we\u2019re trying to do. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously as we move forward here, one of our challenges is going to be capital deployment because we\u2019re going to have a lot of it, and I think we\u2019re going to generate a lot of cash over the coming years, I think we\u2019re going to generate a lot of profit, and we obviously either want to invest that or return it to shareholders at the highest possible return. If it means there\u2019s opportunities in M&amp;A, as you know, historically we\u2019ve always been pretty attentive and diligent about that. I wouldn\u2019t forecast it when or what, but we are out of the range where we\u2019re constrained about our choices. We are no longer constrained, and I think that\u2019s a positive. We\u2019ve gotten there pretty quickly, and that means that we can consider whatever. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We don\u2019t happen to be focused on M&amp;A right now, but M&amp;A isn\u2019t a steady every year thing. It\u2019s opportunistic when it fits the strategy and the intent of the company and when an opportunity fits and a return can be earned. If something like that comes along, I\u2019d say we\u2019re well positioned, we\u2019d be ready to do something, but to be honest, we haven\u2019t seen something that attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the comprehensive answer. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, congrats on a nice start to the year, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe I\u2019ll start one on the guidance, and I have a follow-up. On the guidance, Miles, MitraClip approval came in earlier. I know on the last call, you said you\u2019re not expecting any inflection in MitraClip, but it looks like there might be some contribution in the back half, and I think FX assumptions changed modestly - it\u2019s slightly better. We had a 1Q beat, nutrition coming in better. I\u2019m just curious on the guidance not being tweaked or changed. I know it\u2019s not your style, but I\u2019m just curious on [indiscernible] for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Vijay, thanks for the question. You kind of answered it at the end of your question there, when you said it\u2019s not my style. I rarely, if ever, raise in a first quarter because I kind of feel like if I raised in the first quarter, why didn\u2019t I put it in the original plan three months ago or six months ago. I have generally waited to consider such a thing in the midyear because at various points in time--well, there\u2019s been a number of times, we\u2019ve all been burned by exchange around April-May-June or something for the remainder of the year. I don\u2019t actually expect that this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m no forecaster of exchange and we\u2019re not currency traders, as you know, but just based on what we all see--you know, all industries, all companies, all multinationals and so forth, we were all cautious about China trade and exchange and volatility, the price of oil, even Brexit. These were sort of the big factors everybody talked about. You know, oil is almost $70 and I don\u2019t think Brexit is weighing on a lot of minds. It\u2019s weighing on a lot of European minds, it\u2019s weighing on a lot of U.K. minds, and it depends on how much business you\u2019ve got tied up in the U.K.; but companies have had time to figure out how to mitigate a lot of these things and deal with them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019d say the reason that we didn\u2019t look at raising in the first quarter is because I just don\u2019t raise in the first quarter. We\u2019re obviously off to a strong start. As I told you before, all of our growth story is solid and intact, not seeing any--gosh, I feel like I should knock on wood, I\u2019m not seeing any threats to the growth vehicles in the business, and while some analysts have speculated that med tech or med devices is somehow slowing, I tell you, I don\u2019t see that. I don\u2019t think a lot of other CEOs in medical devices are seeing it either; in fact if anything, I see projected growth rates rising across competitors. I take that as a very healthy signal from the industry that people are seeing positive, robust opportunity. I think a lot of people have new products and robust pipelines, and I think that\u2019s healthy for the whole sector worldwide. There\u2019s a lot of things that haven\u2019t changed, but we\u2019ve been navigating those kinds of things for a while and doing well as an industry and as a company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could we have raised in the first quarter? Well, a lot of you may think so. I\u2019m a little more cautious than that. I always kind of wait until midyear to kind of assess things. I like how the company is performing. I think the company is performing really well. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever had such healthy pipelines so broadly across the line in the company, so I don\u2019t have any negatives. I\u2019m just thinking that one quarter into the year seems a little early to me. That\u2019s about as much as I can tell you. That\u2019s an honest answer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s fair enough, Miles. Whatever it is, it\u2019s the macro, it\u2019s not the fundamentals. Related to that, I guess, the question we\u2019re getting a lot, and not maybe just specific to Abbott but the sector, is the sector--the fundamentals that we\u2019re seeing, is this sustainable? I think specific to Abbott, Libre, can Libre be a north of $5 billion product for you guys longer term? The reason I ask is sustainability, I think you guys gave some numbers on MitraClip in terms of TAM. Libre, I think you\u2019ve kind of left it open-ended, saying it\u2019s a multi-billion dollar product, and I\u2019m just curious whether the Libre 2 that was submitted to the FDA, is that the same product as the Libre 2 in Europe or was the algorithm changed for the U.S. submission? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Vijay, this is Robert. It\u2019s a similar product, it\u2019s just got a different label. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on the TAM for Libre, can this be north of $5 billion for you guys longer term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Listen - we\u2019ve always thought of this as a--if you look at the amount of diabetic patients in the world where this technology tends to have a greater impact, it tends to have a greater impact with insulin users, right, whether you\u2019re a Type 1 or a Type 2 on a conventional injection therapy, and there are 40 million of them around the world, 20 million of them in emerging markets and the other half in developed markets. We think this is, as we said, a multi-billion dollar opportunity, whether it\u2019s two, three, four, five. You can look at these patient segments and patient numbers and it\u2019s very big. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Vijay, I\u2019d add a couple of things to that. We\u2019ve investing in capacity expansion accordingly, but there\u2019s sort of more to this story. As you know, there is a Libre 2 in Europe, there\u2019s a Libre 2 under review in the United States. There\u2019s a Libre 3 in development and has been in development for some time, and there is a lot of potential for expansion of this product to other analytes besides glucose or additional analytes to glucose for the diabetic. There are other improvements that we can make in the product. All of that is in development. We know this platform well. It is a platform, it is not just a glucose test kit, and so there is what I\u2019d call an R&amp;D, development innovation strategy with it that is underway, has been underway. Our capacity expansion plans are well planned. We\u2019ve already got almost a million and a half users of Libre, and to be honest, we haven\u2019t exactly let the floodgates go, so I think you can kind of back into the math of that. This product is already--.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, it\u2019s probably a billion and a half or more in sales, and it\u2019s growing at 80%, so it doesn\u2019t take very long to figure out the math of what you just asked. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our final question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Pasquale</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, appreciate you fitting me in. Miles, one follow-up on Bob\u2019s neural question. We\u2019ve seen new product launches drive momentum for a number of companies in that market over the past couple of years. You guys really haven\u2019t talked much about your pipeline there. Are there new products coming that could help turn that segment around, or is it really just a matter of letting the dust settle on this sales force expansion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well I\u2019d tell you, it\u2019s kind of like--you know, when you\u2019ve got some issues with your own commercial execution and your sales force and you know you\u2019ve got to go fix them, it\u2019s kind of like ducking the question to go talk about your pipeline. My own thought has been, let\u2019s just address the sales force answer and not to try to dodge and weave here about our own execution, which we admit we can do better and we\u2019re going to do better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now having said that, is there a pipeline in development - Robert?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so to that point, we also know that--our first and foremost priority is the field execution. We also know that innovation and evidence also have an impact on our ability to grow, so we\u2019ve doubled our R&amp;D investment in this business since taking it over about two years ago, and I do expect to see two new systems in the pain area come to market towards the end of this year, beginning of next year, and I think that will have a positive impact, obviously ensuring that our sales force is getting up to speed and doing what it needs to do. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Evidence is also another important driver here, so we do have trials that we\u2019re investing and working on for differentiated claims, whether it\u2019s pelvic pain or pre-back surgery kind of claims. So your point of yes, we are investing, we have to make sure we address the field force but we do have a pipeline here that we know we\u2019re going to need to be able to have a sustainable double-digit growth business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Pasquale</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. My last one, just structural heart, already a bright spot for the company today and feels like it has the potential to get even better. As the pipeline there matures, can you just go through your latest thinking on tendine [ph] in Europe, which we should be getting relatively close to here, and then also Portico in the U.S.? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so I think that\u2019s one bright area in the device portfolio. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments here. We talked a bit about TriClip, that we should see towards the end of this year. Tendine, to your point, we filed it last year for CE Mark, so we\u2019re also right now on target to see that come to market at the end of this year. We\u2019ve got a fourth generation MitraClip product that will be coming more towards the second half of this year also, so we\u2019re excited about that; and TAVER, we expect to see that in the U.S., Portico in the U.S. in the first half of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Leinenweber</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, well good.
