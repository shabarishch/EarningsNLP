Joining me are Bill McDermott, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our Chief Financial Officer. During today\u2019s call, we will review our second quarter 2021 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter of 2021 and full year 2021.</p> <p>Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed on this call, particularly our guidance is based on information as of July 28, 2021, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties and assumptions, including those related to the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and global economic conditions. The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating.</p> <p>Those assumptions<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> are based on the facts we know today. Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly, including, but not limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distances and other mitigation requirements. The continued impact of COVID-19 on customers\u2019 purchasing decisions and the length of our sales<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> cycle, particularly for customers in certain industries. Please refer to the press release and the Risk Factors and MD&amp;A sections of our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q and our 10-K filed for fiscal year 2020 for information regarding such risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such forward-looking statements.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also like to point out that the company presents non-GAAP measures in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

These and all prior press releases and investor presentation are posted at investors.servicenow.com. A replay of today\u2019s call will also be posted on the website.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Bill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Bill McDermott</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our Q2 earnings call. Our team delivered an outstanding quarter, significantly exceeding the high end of our guidance across all metrics. Subscription revenues were up 31%. Subscription billings were up 30%. Operating margin was 25% and the number of deals greater than $1 million was 51 up 28% year-over-year. Free cash flow for the first half of the year was up 34% year-over-year, an incredible performance by our team and exceptional first half. And we have unstoppable momentum and we\u2019ve reflected this in our strong full year guidance raise across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gina will review the details with you in a few moments. The global economy is recovering at the fastest pace in 80 years. The enterprise digital transformation market is expected to grow nearly 3 times faster than GDP in 2021. Business leaders worldwide are facing do or die moments. Business models have changed forever. The pandemic has accelerated the digital imperative. We are in a leading position to capitalize on this unprecedented tailwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are giving customers the innovative solution they need to solve the greatest challenges of our time. The world\u2019s biggest challenges [are service now] [(ph), as big as the opportunities, from vaccine management to ESG to the new world of hybrid work. Whatever the challenge work flows with ServiceNow. We\u2019ve created a new market. One that respects the billions and billions of dollars of investment that customers have put into their systems of record. We make those investments work for today\u2019s digital business demands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Now platform, the platform of platforms delivers workflow automation, where the consumers raise user experience that inspires our customers, enabling siloed systems across the enterprise to work together, creating more efficient, more productive ways to get work done. ServiceNow is the control tower for digital transformation for every business in every industry, serving every persona. The power of the Now platform makes this possible with one data model, one architecture and one platform to workflow a better world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, a premium German auto manufacturer faces huge logistical challenges and maintaining on target production. Every 30 million parts are processed daily and they are dispatched to more than 4,000 supplier locations to production centers in Europe and Mexico. To manage this complexity, ServiceNow provides a single connected supply chain technology platform. ServiceNow analyzes 300,000 data points per month optimizing the performance of each aspect of the value chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s just one example of the power of the Now platform. I\u2019d like to share an overview of our success of core ServiceNow\u2019s portfolio. Let\u2019s begin with our IT workflows. We are the standard for optimizing all IT services and operations. Our core IT workflows remained very strong. ITSM was in 16 of our top 20 deals with 14 deals over $1 million. ITOM was in 15 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million. Our AI powered service operations is resonating big time with customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw great wins with leading companies, including Travelers and Walgreens Boots Alliance and more. They\u2019re working with ServiceNow to support their digital transformation of their enterprises. And we\u2019re honored that Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is working with ServiceNow to accelerate its digital transformation efforts and it looks to make Singapore a leading global port and international maritime center. MPA will leverage the Now Platform to drive automation and to improve productivity and employee experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With employee workflows we make work better by driving outstanding employee experience that enhance productivity for employees anytime, anywhere, while also developing company loyalty, which is particularly important in this environment. The Now platform provides employees a system of action for key events, including onboarding, parental leave, moving, and many more moments that matter for people, employee workflows were in 13 of our top 20 deals with six deals over $1 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Asahi] (ph) for example, is focused on expanding growth while reinforcing ESG initiatives that support sustainable value creation. They chose the Now Platform to improve the employee experience by providing a single point of contact for employees to improve productivity. They wanted service catalogs so they could standardize HR processes and they wanted integrations to connect all their siloed workflows. With customer workflows, we\u2019re creating a new service paradigm by delivering connected experiences that we define customer operations for greatest speed, agility, transparency, and convenience all while working with existing systems. Customer workflows were in 10 of our top 20 deals with four deals over $1 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now have over 2,000 customers running customer service management. Deutsche Telekom is leveraging ServiceNow\u2019s telecommunications solution to streamline order management to become the leading B2B telco provider. The Now Platform will be at the heart of the order management process enabling a 360 degree view of orders, inventory and infrastructure creating a seamless connected experience for DT\u2019s employees and customers. With creative workflows, we\u2019re accelerating software development across the entire enterprise by giving everyone the low-code tools to quickly create applications and beautiful experiences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">IDC predicts that more than 500 million apps will be developed by 2023. This is equivalent to the total number of apps that were developed in the past 40 years. For example, Airbus built an innovative tracking application in less than three months using ServiceNow\u2019s low-code app engine. Now Airbus employees can scan barcodes of any piece of factory equipment to see the relevant information they need in real time. Manufacturing transportation incidents have dropped 20%. In Q2 creative workflows were in 18 of our top 20 deals. Nokia picked ServiceNow\u2019s creative workflows to develop custom apps in significantly less time at a fraction of the cost of alternative platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These examples show how the combined capabilities of the workflows on the Now platform are better together. They deliver even more value than the sum of their parts. Our introduction of the Now buying program has helped customers realize those synergies more quickly by simplifying the buying process, providing greater usage flexibility all while improving business impact, continuing to build a strong client and alliance ecosystem, we established an enterprise agreement through the Now buying program with Deloitte, who will take advantage of our old products suite to facilitate great experiences for their employees and clients, while enhancing efficiencies and compliance management for the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also in our partner ecosystem, we recently announced our integration with Microsoft Windows 365. This will enable users to easily access cloud PCs directly through Microsoft teams, regardless of the employee\u2019s location in the hybrid work environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, I am incredibly proud of our team passion to solving the world\u2019s greatest challenges. Our engineering team is second to none. Our go-to-market organization is the best in the business. In our purpose to make work better for people is resonating. It\u2019s been an honor to help turn vaccines into vaccinations for millions and millions of people. It\u2019s a privilege to help the world reopen and safely returned to the workplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are engaging leaders on how we can solve society\u2019s biggest problems, improve the lives of people and help deliver better services to citizens everywhere. We are better than we were yesterday not as good as will be tomorrow. This is a special company with unbridled energy and unprecedented opportunity. We are well on our way to becoming the defining enterprise software company of the 21st century. And I look forward to taking your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But first, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Gina. Gina, over to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gina Mastantuono</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Bill. Q2 was a tremendous quarter with strong beats across our top line and profitability guidance metric. The team demonstrated exceptional execution and we saw strong demand across all regions and workflows. Q2 subscription revenues was $1.33 billion, $35 million above the high end of our guidance range and growing 31% year-over-year inclusive of a 450 basis points tailwind from FX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remaining performance obligation or RPO ended the quarter at approximately $9.5 billion, representing 35% year-over-year growth. Current RPO was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 34% year-over-year growth and a $4.3 billion versus our guidance. Currency was a 300 basis point tailwind year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Q2 subscription billing to $1.328 billion representing 30% year-over-year growth by $73 million beat versus the high end of our guidance, FX and duration where 500 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. We saw growth across all our industry categories, financial services and manufacturing are particularly strong across the globe driven by investments in business continuity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Industry is impacted by COVID, including retail and hospitality also showed signs of recovery with strong net new ACV growth in the quarter. The Now platform remains a mission critical part of our customer\u2019s operations, reflected by our strong 97% renewal rate. The stickiness that our customer base has served as a solid foundation for us to build upon with our land and expand growth strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This was evident that the continued growth in our average customer spend this quarter. As of the end of Q2, we had 1,201 customers payments over $1 million in ACV of 25% year-over-year. This included 62 customers paying us over $10 million in ACV. Overall, we close 51 deals greater than $1 million net new ACV in the quarter. We\u2019re also seeing robust net new ACV growth from new customers with the average deal size growing over 50% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going to market with a solution sales approach to deliver the full capabilities of the portfolio, instead of selling point products continues to drive more multiproduct deals. In Q2, 18 of our top 20 deals included three or more products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to profitability, operating margin was 25%, three points above our guidance driven by the strong revenue beat G&amp;A cost saving and some marketing spend that was pushed into the second half of the year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%. Together, these results show the power of our business model and our ability to drive a balance of growth and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To navigate the post-COVID economy and the new era of work, businesses are investing in digital transformation to unlock new levels of innovation, agility and productivity. And we\u2019ve heard from Bill, the macro trends starting digital transformation or significant opportunity for ServiceNow. Our Knowledge 2021 event in May, included two amazing weeks of keynote, panels and discussion that brought together experts and thought leaders of every industry across 141 countries to focus on these topics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This year, we released new solutions, including our manufacturing and healthcare industry product and showcase the power and endless possibilities achievable through ServiceNow workflow. The response from customers has been fantastic. The pipeline generated per attending account without 45% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Together, the macro tailwind and interest generated from knowledge has accelerated pipeline growth for the second half of 2021. Furthermore, our coverage ratio today continues to remain ahead of a year ago. As a result, we are raising guidance for the full year. We\u2019re raising our subscription revenues outlook by $73 million at the midpoint point to a range of $5.53 billion to $5.54 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth, including 250 basis points of FX tailwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are raising our subscription billings outlets by $123 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.315 billion to $6.325 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Excluding the early customer payments in 2020, our normalized subscription billings growth outlook for the year would be 31% at the midpoint. Growth includes in that tailwind and FX duration, 200 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to expect 2021 subscription gross margin of 85% and we are raising our full year 2021 operating margin from 23.5% to 24.5%. This reflects the increase in our top-line growth, more efficient marketing spend and stayed in some continued lower G&amp;A expenses related to COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are raising our full year of 2021 free cash margin by one point from 30% to 31%. I\u2019ve note that from a seasonality perspective, we\u2019re expecting 40% of our total free cash flow in Q4. And lastly, we expect diluted weighted average outstanding shares of 202 million. For Q3, we expect subscription revenues between $1.4 billion and $1.405 billion, representing 28% to 29% year-over-year growth, including 150 basis points FX tailwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect cRPO growth of 30% year-over-year, including 150 basis points FX tailwind. We expect subscription billing between $1.32 billion and $1.325 billion, representing 22% to 23% year-over-year growth. Growth includes the net tailwind from FX and duration of 50 basis points. As a reminder, looking at billings in the four quarter rolling basis, we\u2019ll help normalize the quarterly seasonality and changes in customer invoicing terms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On that basis, our Q3 subscription billings guidance would represent 31% year-over-year growth. We expect an operating margin of 23%, and 202 million diluted weighted outstanding shares for the quarter. In conclusion, digital transformation is accelerating across the globe and ServiceNow is at the epicenter of that opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ServiceNow is a digital fabric that stitches together existing systems of record, collapsing silos to connect fragmented processes. We are the platform company for digital business and we are well on our way to becoming $15 billion revenue company. I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s performance this quarter and Bill and I can\u2019t thank our employees enough for their hard work and incredible dedication.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&amp;A.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, congrats on a very strong second quarter. Bill, can you talk a little bit to the growing pipeline that you kind of mentioned here on the call? Just talk a little bit about sales cycles, I would assume that helping you this year, but also kind of sets the foundation for next year. Just any color there would be nice. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thank you very much, Raimo, for the question. First, I\u2019d like to recognize our outstanding IT leadership, as well as our incredible focus on analytics in the company, because we really run the company on the ServiceNow platform. And whatever all the systems even exist in the company, I couldn\u2019t pick out of a lineup, because only thing we look at as Now, ServiceNow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I have real-time data on every single account and every single deal that\u2019s moving in the global economy. And I can tell you that the pipeline is incredibly robust. And it has substantially grown and the lights are all green. Our sales leader is extremely positive on the second half of the year as is our engineering leader and the unity in the company around performing right now is really strong. So you can take Gina\u2019s value and the raise that she just put in front of the capital markets to heart, because we looked at every detail and everywhere we could with our own information. It\u2019s very, very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the sales cycles, I think the sales cycles are moving quicker. The notoriety of the brand is resonating as the digital transformation control tower, as I said. IT is the stronghold on so many things now, because if you want to give the employees a great experience that you want to provide the customers an unmatched service or you want to unify IT business around creating these new workflows, which is necessary, because there\u2019s not enough developers to develop all the applications that are required. Everybody can agree on the Now platform and that seems to be unifying organizations between IT and business and accelerating our sales cycles and enlarging our deal sizes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you. And then any early feedback from the customers around Lightstep, because that\u2019s obviously like expanding your TAM quite a bit, what has been the early feedback from the customer base. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I really like to thank Ben and his team for their trust in ServiceNow, and Pablo and CJ and our great engineering team for the work that they\u2019re doing together. What we think is that ServiceNow has proven capabilities combined with Lightstep\u2019s observability technology will really help organizations seamlessly connect, because that\u2019s the big deal, seamlessly connect the insights in that data form the necessary patterns in that data. And then action them into the workflow which enables people process and technology to truly deliver great experiences for the customers and the employees and I think what differentiates us uniquely is this is one pane of glass. It\u2019s one user experience, and it is not just the developer operations, you\u2019ll also see business executives align on this as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And to us that\u2019s going to really help organization seamlessly connect their digital experiences across the enterprise. Again, the platform I can\u2019t stress this enough, the digital platform, the Now platform is the glue that\u2019s tying it all together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Well done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats from me as well. Bill, you talked about the power of the platform with really a consumer grade interface, but also I think the simplifying buying process new ELAs is really powerful and you called out Deloitte, I guess I wanted to double-click on that a bit and really the importance of this simplifying buying process and how you see that benefiting really new account acquisition as well as expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, absolutely Matt. The main thing is speed, right. We\u2019re in a market that is very robust. Digital transformation is really hot and we are that signature brand. So the more quickly we can evolve the upgrade process and the net new deals to get customers live, that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about. And I want you to rest assured that from finance to legal, to the way we execute the sales motions in the field and also enable our ecosystem, that whole value chain is right now pedal to the metal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when you think about the Now buying program, we\u2019re looking at larger rapidly expanding customers and making it easier for them to grow with us. So that includes simplifying the buying process as you rightly point out, using flexibility so they can easily upgrade to higher tiers of product innovation, our innovators, they\u2019re just so amazing here. Every time you turn around and the next release is a new breakthrough, I just can\u2019t thank them enough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ITSM Pro and enterprise are doing terrific, and this is enabling customers to try things as well. And exchange or adopt products at their will, and it\u2019s giving them a forward look at where we\u2019re going with our roadmaps. And when they see the innovation powered ServiceNow that actually buys them in very quickly. And finally, I would just like to say, we\u2019ve done a really good job on the industry domain expertise in the company, but also on aligning all the value that we have to the platform and making sure that the customer understands the value they realized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as they step in to bigger relationships with us, we can predict those expansions and those pricing tiers and the integrated customer success support and value, and they can carry that into the boardroom with great confidence and say, this is what ServiceNow is doing to deliver for you; I was really excited when I saw the Telia article that went out today, where they were talking about retiring 75 legacy systems that they standardized on the Now platform. So it\u2019s just really good for the customer and it\u2019s good for our folks too to get the customer to value fast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Makes sense. Maybe just a quick one for Gina. Last quarter, you talked about net new ACV acceleration, and I guess maybe I can assume based on your increased guidance, what the answer is, be curious if you have any thoughts on net new ACV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So I talked about net new ACV accelerating in 2021 versus 2020. And we have definitely seen that happening across the board and with our strong beat in Q2 and our raise in the back-half the acceleration that we\u2019re seeing is actually greater than initially anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Hedberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great to hear. Thanks a lot, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Matt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much and hearty congratulations on another spectacular quarter. I couldn\u2019t help, but notice that the net new ACV contribution from your core IT business \u2013 workflow business was up very sharply, curious to get your thoughts on what\u2019s happening in that segment of the market. And Bill, I also noticed that the headcount in sales and marketing also went up pretty significantly. Can you just talk about, what the implications are for number one, the increase in net new business coming from your core business, coupled with what seems to be a pretty gigantic increase in sales and marketing, which I guess is a positive. But I just want you to give me the implications of these two observations. Thank you so much and congrats.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thank you very much Kash. And thank you for all the things that you saw in the Now platform and our leadership in the market, I really appreciate it. In terms of the core business, the core is becoming more and more relevant as these enterprises try to separate away from the old world of islands of automation and point solution buying and dealing with fragmented systems, processes and silos.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the core of the core, of course, is our ITX portfolio, and that is really resonating with our customers. Because they can do all the things they want to do on one platform. And to the extent, they want to leverage other technologies that they\u2019ve already invested in, of course, we\u2019re so accommodating to that, because our great engineers have built all out of the box integrations to the biggest systems in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s kind of started with the core and now it\u2019s moving across the enterprise with great speed and all the businesses have done great. And in fact, all the geos are ahead of their operating plans and they\u2019re all doing really, really well in every geography and every industry is amazing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I would just like to give you a feel for this Kash by just saying, like, we have seen the immediate impact of our innovation core as we expand the perimeter to employee and customer service management and now creator our great sales leadership sees the opportunity and they see the hockey stick building in the pipeline. And we\u2019re trying to get out in front of that with the coverage model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what I think you made a great sage comment on is that\u2019s a high class situation, because most companies are complaining about the [war on] (ph) talent and they\u2019re actually suffering because they don\u2019t have enough talented people to do the job. We\u2019re only hiring 1% of the applicants that are highly qualified to come into ServiceNow and the hardest part our recruiting team\u2019s doing right now is just keeping up with the inflow of all the resumes. So I think it\u2019s great that we\u2019re actually hiring ahead. We see a great hockey stick in the pipeline and I have tremendous confidence in our sales leadership all over the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, brilliant. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Kash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. So I want to ask a similar question in that, around the ELA cycle and the deals that you talked about. Can you comment on how common that is for your pipeline right now versus maybe in previous years and give us a sense for the kind of magnitude of upsell that is possible when customers move at an accelerated pace to these enterprise buying activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, Alex. I mean, the good news is, it\u2019s early \u2013 it\u2019s a very, very small part of our results and a very, very small part of our pipeline. So the upside for this initiative and this way of thinking is quite dramatic. Because if you think about enterprise solution selling and you do that in all the geos and all the industries, and you really establish a relationship plan with the customers at the C level, that\u2019s quite convincing, you could do a lot. And what we could also do is get customers resonating with this and really lock them into the idea of a future roadmap. So they become a design partner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s really what we want. We don\u2019t want sales, we want partnerships. So if we have design partnerships to go three to five years, we\u2019re buying into the roadmap and we\u2019re doing that giving the customer all the benefits of scale and innovation that they deserve from ServiceNow. And at the same time, we\u2019re investing less calories in selling things and more calories on building relationships that last a lifetime.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would just add Alex that on that while it\u2019s still small, the current expansion that we\u2019re having with our customers, who are going through this buying, we\u2019re going to pretty significant. So we\u2019re really happy with it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. And then just maybe one follow-up for you, Gina, if you look at the guidance on a constant currency basis, can you give us a sense, just, I mean, clearly Q3 is a big federal quarter and everything we\u2019ve heard to gesture federal pipeline is quite robust. Can you give us some puts and takes around the guardrails or the conservatism and the guidance that takes that strong federal pipeline into account?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Great question. We absolutely are expecting another strong federal quarters this year. But if you remember on a quarterly basis, there\u2019s a lot of seasonality built into billing. And so as we shared in the past, there\u2019s a couple of drivers impacting the growth rate, which is really a function of renewal invoice timing, and not a function of business performance. So one particular item this quarter of Q3 is at some of our customers are becoming larger. They\u2019ve requested a change in annual semi bill \u2013 the semiannual billing and this is much more pronounced in Q3 of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we had two large customers that were previously invoiced annually in Q3 2020, that are now being invoiced sending an annual. So that\u2019s actually resulting in two point headwind to the year-over-year growth. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I talked about the four quarter rolling number and if you look at four quarter rolling for Q3 with this guide, it implies 31% year-over-year growth. So we absolutely expect the strong federal quarter, we absolutely expect continued acceleration in net new and we are feeling really good about Q3 as well as the full year increase in billings guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Alex, if I could build on Gina\u2019s outstanding commentary, I would just say there\u2019s many big opportunities in the back end of the year, in federal, in particular. And the attending to be large programs, as opposed to smaller point solutions. And again, this is more or less the theme now as we\u2019ve become an enterprise solutions company and you\u2019re seeing business in the area of resiliency, there\u2019s a lot of focused on business continuity now outages of course, and dealing with the COVID scenario, cyber security is on the top of many lists and programs that we\u2019re involved in and vaccine management. Vaccine management is one of the greatest workflow challenges the government faces.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as you can tell, they\u2019ll likely need to be readministering things regularly and managing that process, where our front and center on that. And of course, I\u2019m really proud actually of the way the government is looking at digital transformation. They really are looking at this as a way to help government run like business. And there\u2019s a lot of really smart operators on the technology side that I\u2019ve met in many of the large programs and our team is very humble to have an opportunity to help not only the United States, but many of the governments around the world is really exciting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alex Zukin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Makes total sense. And Gina, this is why we\u2019re all very thankful that you\u2019re now guiding to current RPO, where these issues probably don\u2019t \u2013 are less impactful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Exactly. Exactly. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregg Moskowitz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks very much for taking the question. Bill, should we construe the strong Q2 results in your bullish pipeline commentary to mean that you\u2019ve clearly begun to benefit more from the economy reopening. And then also, how do you see that playing out over the back half of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, Gregg. Certainly, I think it\u2019s beginning to show in the results and I have to say, part of my belief is that as the economy opens up even more. That can only benefit ServiceNow even more. We have done a great job and I really do take my hat off to our team and all functions of the company to stay focused on the customer and digital only world is not an easy thing to do. And ServiceNow employees that stood up to the challenge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But now as the economies open up and people are back in the office and there is a hybrid world that we\u2019re all accommodating, I do believe getting our sales professionals and executives in front of other executives is only going to help the story resonate even more. So the important thing I believe is that we all learn something from COVID and we recognize what\u2019s essential in terms of travel and accommodating personal meetings versus what is more adequately handled using tools that are digital and can be scaled even faster. And it\u2019s the combination of those two forces that I think will really lift ServiceNow actually to new heights, Gregg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregg Moskowitz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s great. Thanks, Bill. And then just one for Gina, I think your subscription gross margins are a bit lower than they\u2019ve been in awhile. Is there anything that you would call that here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the margins we talked about there, we were keeping them flat to our guys that they are impacted versus the prior year a bit. And we talked about this earlier in the year when making increased investment in our data centers and customer support to serve customers impacted by the new data residency regulations, as well as serving our customers who require additional security measures such as IL-5 for our fed customers. So those are the big ticket items that are impacting our margin that was included in our original dive for the year. And we are achieving exactly what we set out to do on both those funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gregg Moskowitz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Arjun Bhatia. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arjun Bhatia</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I want to start off maybe with the new customers, is it clearly seems like there\u2019s strong traction there and your platform is broader than it used to be many years ago. I\u2019m wondering how many of your new customers are coming in off of that outside of your core IT workflows in HR, in customer service management. Are you seeing traction there from new customers or was that mostly a point of expansion from existing customers?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a really good question, Arjun. What we\u2019re seeing is, ServiceNow has hired some of the best people in the world and creative workflows and customer service management and employee experience. And we are built big businesses within our company in these categories. So it\u2019s not at all unusual to see a customer begin with us on the employee experience side. There are many customers out there today that have systems of record that frankly can accommodate a one-stop shop for all the hybrid work needs of a workforce that\u2019s going to be everywhere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we uniquely serve that need with that consumer grade UX on the mobile. And now you see us with amazing partnerships with Microsoft and others. And I think that really is creating a lot of interest in the marketplace and yes, new deals beginning with employee experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The same thing on customer service management. We\u2019re now in a direct-to-consumer digital first world and the Now Platform is uniquely advantaged for customer service. And that is our focus and there\u2019s many companies, especially in telecommunications and banking, not limited to that, that have come to us and started with us data. And I really want to stress this create a workflow situation. If you think about the 500 million apps that are going to have to be developed and the shortage of developers to do it, what you\u2019re going to see is a groundswell of new business opportunities with ServiceNow starting there, because what\u2019s happening is they have to start with the low-code, but they also want the resiliency and the security of tying in to a unified platform like ServiceNow, and ServiceNow is friendly to everybody in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s what customers want. They want somebody that breaks them out of the islands of automation. So we\u2019ve seen new deals and creator and customer and employee, not just starting with IT. And yes, that is kind of a new frontier. And it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re very bullish on the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would just add on that really pleased with our new customer growth. We talked about it in the script about five new customers, just this quarter, over $1 million, and that\u2019s across several different industries. And all of those five customers actually purchased five or more products. So cross-platform, it\u2019s quite amazing. And so I still talks about IT certainly continues to be a high percentage of our new logos, but we\u2019re seeing more and more, a high percentage of land with TSM, app engine and HR. So really, really pleased with the progress there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arjun Bhatia</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. That\u2019s great to hear. And one more, if I can follow-up on Gregg\u2019s question about reopening, I\u2019m curious if the delta variant or any impact from that is coming up in your conversations with customers and whether this is something that you\u2019re factoring, if you\u2019re factoring that into guidance at all at this point or if it\u2019s still too early to bake in any impact from impact of verticals on that front?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And certainly first and foremost, our greatest concern is always for the health and wellbeing of our people and our hearts go out to all those affected. And we definitely having conversations with customers, but with that said our business model is extremely resilient and predictable. We have a very robust backlog RPO exiting Q2 at $9.5 billion. And we talked about pipeline, right our pipeline continues to look really strong and our coverage ratio is better than the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s definitely off getting any potential conversion rates that might come under pressure. So I feel extremely confident in our guide right now. And we\u2019re certainly seeing the acceleration of digital transformation as hybrid environment, continuing to accelerate itself feels very strong about the guide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Arjun Bhatia</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Congrats again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really nice quarter as well. I want to ask a kind of a higher level question. What are the \u2013 investor debates going on right now is relative strength in the market of back office applications versus front office with most investors thinking that that most of the focal point is on the front office. You guys see both sides of the equation. So Bill, can you give us some indication on sort of whether there\u2019s a relative more strength in the front office and back office or how you\u2019re seeing that market environment right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a really important question. One of the things that\u2019s really, really interesting Keith is, it\u2019s neither a back nor front office world anymore. It actually is both and that\u2019s the big change in the enterprise. And that\u2019s why the Now Platform is uniquely competitive advantage for us and for our customers on our ecosystem, because it actually ties the front and the back together. And that\u2019s the big aha, so many enterprise participants and I\u2019ve been in the enterprise for awhile made their success at a being good in functional domains with shrink wrapped software and then pushing it out globally and getting standards built on it and then eco systems evolve on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But what happened, especially in this hybrid work from anywhere world and with the digital transformation era, these are do or die moments now. And the executives in these companies need to have that resilient IT for that\u2019s absolutely Fort Knox in terms of its security, its resilience and its performance. And it has to serve the business and then the business is pulling at IT to serve it. But even as the business wants to get innovative and do its own thing, in this world, the silos are an impediment to progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think having a great front office employee experience and having a great front office customer service management and a great career workflow is tied to that resilient core. It\u2019s really resonating so big time. And the other thing is, it\u2019s really nice to speak well of all the market participants, because we just want to make them all better and we want to make all the customers successful. So that Now Platform is really thinking in as the platform for digital business and that\u2019s really what we dreamed of and it\u2019s happening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And if I think one last one, I think it kind of dovetails what you are talking about in terms of working well with the other market participants. And it\u2019s kind of more of a question on the other side, I\u2019ve always thought of your ITSM solution is kind of the backbone within the IT department, which everybody integrates into. And one of those major integrations has been the observability vendors in the states. I\u2019ve always heard them talk about sort of as not being one of the most requested integrations on their platform, but now you\u2019re going to start competing with these guys. So how do you balance being that good partner as the backbone within IT, but also starting to emerge as more of a competitor and observability?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s very important to acknowledge that it\u2019s not about competing with the other participants in the market. It\u2019s about innovating on the Now Platform and giving the customer as much innovation as we possibly can. So they can conduct their business processes and their workflows on the Now Platform. To the extent, there are functionalities or investments that have been made in other participants in the market. We\u2019re very happy to integrate with them and accentuate that functionality into our Now Workflow. So the customer gets the best of all worlds. I will tell you that there are many customers that absolutely tell us that we want [Technical Difficulty]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026to particular functional areas who intervene it means and that\u2019s it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much for the question, Keith. Hey look, the reality is we\u2019re the only born in the cloud so for a company to have eclipsed $5 billion in revenue without large M&amp;A. We\u2019re highly aware of that. But we also aware that this is a very unique culture and this sales \u2013 for engineers is really in a league of its own and we continue to run the playbook again innovation. And that is what I represented and Gina represented at our Capital Markets Day, when we said we\u2019d be a $15 billion plus revenue company. Having said that, RPA, and some of the other items that you mentioned, you shouldn\u2019t expect us to make acquisitions in that space, but you should expect us to build our functionality and our capabilities, but also be an open and willing partner for the customers because it\u2019s really about solving their problems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the biggest thing I hear from them is, they\u2019ve got lots of good points solutions all over the place. And that in effect is the root cause of a lot of the mess that\u2019s been created in these enterprises. And more and more when I talk to leaders of companies and spent quite a bit of time during that this year, they tell me that they\u2019re looking for that control tower, that, that clear pane of glass that can move their workloads, enable that workflows, tighten up their systems, their siloed operations, and enable their people to serve their customers. And really that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019ll always keep bringing it back to, we can get where we said, we\u2019d go organically. We\u2019re always on our tippy toes, looking at what\u2019s best for our customers and our shareholders. And we always look at that. But right now, the plan is ever steady and there are no plans to acquire in the space that you mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Keith Weiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Many things, Bill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much for the question too. Thank you, Keith.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And your next question comes from Tyler Radke from Citi. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question. Bill, last quarter you talked about the EMEA business, I think you said it was on fire and clearly it\u2019s nice to see the uptick in EMEA as a percentage of revenue. Curious how that\u2019s evolved this quarter, obviously there\u2019s kind of some mixed trends over there as it relates to reopening. But just wanted to see what if you\u2019re seeing that momentum carry into Q2 and your thoughts there for the back half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. EMEA is doing fabulous. And one of the big changes that we\u2019ve made in EMEA was obviously the proper leadership, not just that the immediate ahead level, which is now obviously working extremely well and very proud of that, but also in significant countries within EMEA, because as you know, every country in Europe has its own unique culture, its own unique business motions, and you have to be strong with leadership and all of the geographies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re able to attract and retain the very best people in the enterprise software industry. I think that\u2019s one of the root causes of our success. The second would be our C-level relationships. We have upped our game and instead of dealing with only the CIO, which is an incredibly important executive to us. We have also created relationship plans across the C-suite and really enabled the platform strategy for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think that\u2019s the big evolution of ServiceNow in EMEA. We\u2019ve become a platform company there as well. So it\u2019s kind of exciting when you consider how talk to Europe has had it with COVID and the travel restriction to do as well as we are. And can you imagine when things do loosen up and open up a little bit, just how big this is going to get in Europe for us. So we\u2019re very excited. The business is going great. And in EMEA, just so, if the head of the first half operating plan, the internal operating plan and that\u2019s a really good sign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would just add to there that only did EMEA do well. We had really strong performance across all regions, Americas and APJ as well. So we\u2019re really feeling good from a geography perspective that, that we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tyler Radke</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And just as making a quick follow-up. So I think you talked about Creator workflows, being an 18 in the top 20 deals, which was more than both ITSM and ITOM, but it did a down tick from 20% of net new ACV to 14% this quarter. I was curious if there\u2019s anything to call out there, whether it was just smaller creator deal sizes, or it was just the IPPs was so strong this quarter. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll take that. So platform had a very strong quarter and you\u2019re right in 17 of our top 20 deals, including one deal over $1 million. Q1, we closed some seven figure, multiple seven figure Creator workflow deals, which were unusually large and more than we typically see in one particular quarter. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a shift queue. In Q2, we really basically went back to a more normalized run rate of the 14%, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I know that back in financial Analyst Day in May, we talked about the fact that we expect creative workflows becomes 20% of net new ACV by 2024. And we\u2019re well on our way and are doing extremely well in that trajectory. So we feel really good about the performance. And then Bill, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything on the actual strategy behind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. I think you did a great Gina. And I think you also acknowledged all of our regional leaders and I like to acknowledge all of our regional leaders along with you, it\u2019s a great thing, and also our leadership executive team here and all the folks in engineering that have worked tirelessly to build the most innovative platform in the world is truly an honor to be associated with these folks. And I\u2019m so bullish on creative workflow. And I truly believe that the new motion in the enterprise, it\u2019s not going to be in a separate endeavors of innovation. It\u2019s going to be the unification of innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the big organizations are going to insist on enterprise coherence and security and business process alignment, and the CEOs of very involved in digital transformation, the CEOs that are out there, some of the greatest leaders I\u2019ve ever seen, and they\u2019re very focused on digital first and they\u2019re not going to let these enterprises do whatever they want to do. So the companies that have true platforms that are acknowledged in the strategy room of the Board of Directors of given companies are going to do very well now. And the ones that are trying to get there, you better have a really great story on how you\u2019re going to take care of all the needs of the enterprise and not just a few needs of a specific silo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will be taking one more question from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sterling Auty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Just one question from my side, you mentioned the improvement in the hardest hit industries from the pandemic. I\u2019m curious, what are these industries prioritizing in terms of their spend with ServiceNow and how durable do you expect that spending to be moving forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gina Mastantuono</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, great question. We\u2019re really pleased with the trajectory there and that they are returning to more normalized spending habits. The areas that I can call out most are really around business resilience and how do they make sure that they are extremely well positioned, as we come out of this pandemic to help their employees be more productive in a hybrid world to really help ensure that their operations are as resilient as possible. So that\u2019s throughout our IT, whether it\u2019s ITOM and ITAM together or ITBM as well as risk and security. So really across the board feeling really good about the fact that, that, that\u2019s opening up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would build on Gina\u2019s comments Sterling by also saying that the speed of digital business right now is faster than I think any of us could have even imagined. And they\u2019re all talking seamless customer experience. And when you have to have a seamless customer experience to win, you have to align the value chain across the entire enterprise to earn that customer loyalty. And what you see in a lot of these companies is the middle office operations and just how manual these processes are and just how fractured the data is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re really good in getting the data organized and focused and put into a workflow so you can align the business process and you can be more resilient, but at the same time, you can enable this direct-to-consumer relationship. I mean, when was the last time anyone on this call went into a bank, everything is done on the mobile. Everything is direct-to-consumer. Everything has to happen with a gorgeous, simplified UI. And I think that is really driving so much of the conversations we\u2019re in right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sterling Auty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bill McDermott</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And due to time constraints, that will be our last question. And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines.
