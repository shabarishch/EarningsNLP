Also, we will release [second] quarter earnings on Thursday, November 16.</p> <p>And now, I'd like to turn it over to Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Douglas McMillon</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Our second quarter results were solid with continued topline momentum in the business. Walmart U.S. grew comp sales 1.8% and comp traffic 1.3%. We continue to gain traction in e-commerce with Walmart U.S. GMV up 67%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The U.S. store<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> team has done a great job staying focused on providing a fast and easy customer experience while managing expenses and inventory. Customers are responding to the improvements we\u2019re making to deliver a seamless shopping experience that saves them time and money and that\u2019s exciting to see.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, Sam\u2019s Club delivered comp traffic growth of more than 2%. In International, nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. So overall, we\u2019re making progress across the business and feel good about where we are midway through the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strategy is to make every day easier for busy families. To accomplish this, we continue our transformation to become more of a digital enterprise that moves with speed and agility. I\u2019m encouraged by innovation in the business. We\u2019re testing associate delivery of walmart.com orders in a few stores and by the end of the year, we\u2019ll have approximately 100 automated pickup towers in stores across the U.S., where customers can pick up their orders within a matter of minutes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With Easy Reorder on walmart.com, a customer has visibility to their past in-store and online purchases. In a matter of seconds, they can easily repurchase the items they\u2019ve bought most frequently before and save the time it may have taken to make a weekly shopping list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another example is our integrated back-to-school offering. Our dedicated back-to-school destination on walmart.com enables customers to shop school supply lists for more than a million classrooms across the United States. They can find their own list by simply entering their zip code and quickly adding all the items from the school list to their basket.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then, they can choose whether to pick up the items at their local store or ship them to their home. It\u2019s a huge time-saver for busy families. If you haven\u2019t done your back-to-school shopping, you should definitely check this out. We have tests going on with digital endless aisle shopping, robotics and image analytics to scan aisles for outs and we\u2019re using machine learning to assist our merchants with pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sam\u2019s Club members continue to provide great feedback on the convenience of Scan &amp; Go and we\u2019ll be further expanding Scan &amp; Go within Walmart U.S. this year. This quarter, we also enjoyed welcoming entrepreneurs from more than 500 small businesses to Bentonville to pitch their Made in the USA products to sell in our stores and online as part of our Investing in American Jobs Open Call in June.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And last month, we released proposals for policy actions to address barriers to manufacturing growth here in the U.S. We\u2019re pleased to be making progress towards our goal of purchasing an additional $250 billion in products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. Customers want to buy products that are not only good for their families, but also for the people that made them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In e-commerce, customers are responding favorably to our expanded assortment, which surpassed 67 million SKUs on walmart.com. Our recent acquisitions, such as Moosejaw, Shoebuy and Bonobos, further improved our assortment, and have provided critical category expertise in higher margin categories like shoes and apparel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of weeks ago, I was in Boston to meet with the Shoebuy team, which is now known as shoes.com. They were very engaged and really impressive. In addition, I was excited to visit with the Moosejaw team in Detroit in July. This talented group is thriving in their creative culture and it was great to hear what they\u2019re working on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe that we\u2019re uniquely positioned to grow and delight customers by providing the seamless shopping experience they desire. Having stores within 10 miles of approximately 90% of the U.S. population allows us to serve customers in ways that are most convenient for them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve seen strong results from the rollout of online grocery, which is now in more than 900 U.S. locations, and we\u2019re expanding this service in many of our markets around the world. Retail is constantly evolving and it\u2019s critical that we move even faster as the customer and competitive landscape continue to change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brett will provide more details on the financials shortly, but before he does, I\u2019ll talk briefly about each area of the business. Let me start with Walmart U.S. We had a strong quarter with comp sales growth of 1.8% and comp traffic growth of 1.3%. It\u2019s exciting that sales growth is coming from across the business including stores, e-commerce and a combination of both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Under Greg Foran\u2019s leadership, the stores continue to perform well. The grocery business has really strengthened as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years. We\u2019re also pleased with the expense discipline as physical stores leveraged expenses for the second consecutive quarter. We\u2019ve done this while maintaining high in-stock and service levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Store associates are using better technology and processes to perform their tasks and we\u2019re becoming more efficient. Our training programs are fueling this progress as well. This training is not only equipping associates for their current roles, but preparing them for promotion into roles with greater responsibility and pay. We\u2019ve now opened 175 training academies and expect to have 200 operating by the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Walmart U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore and the team delivered another quarter of robust topline growth with GMV up 67%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com as customers are finding a broader assortment and more options to receive what they want at their convenience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They love not having to pay a membership fee to get Walmart\u2019s free two-day shipping on millions of items. And we\u2019re seeing a nice increase in customers receiving discounts for picking up non-store items at their local stores. Marc, Greg and their teams continue to make good progress in driving innovative solutions across the business and providing the seamless shopping experience customers\u2019 desire.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Staying in the U.S., let\u2019s talk about Sam\u2019s Club. John Furner and team have improved execution, resulting in stronger comp traffic. Sam\u2019s Club had comp sales growth without fuel of 1.2% in the quarter led by 2.1% comp traffic growth and e-commerce GMV increased 23%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win. Club Pickup continues to grow and I\u2019m excited about how we\u2019re leveraging clubs to serve members across multiple channels. We\u2019re also strengthening the assortment with exciting merchandise, including progress in fresh and with our private brand, Member\u2019s Mark, which is more than a $10 billion brand and growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Outside the U.S., the Walmart International team, led by Dave Cheesewright, continued to deliver strong underlying results with nine of 11 markets posting positive comp sales and the segment leveraging expenses overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Walmex continues to be the strongest International market with comp sales growth of more than 7% in the quarter. What\u2019s even more impressive is that this sales momentum is broad-based across all countries and regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In China, our stores are improving and we launched Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club global flagship stores through our alliance with JD.com this quarter. In addition, more than 25% of Walmart stores in China now offer delivery of orders in less than one hour through the JD Daojia delivery platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Canada, the business continues to perform well. The investments that we\u2019ve made in price are resonating with customers and contributing to market share gains in key traffic driving categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also encouraged that the UK delivered positive comp sales. In June, I visited Asda to see the progress being made. Customers are responding to investments in price and store experience by visiting the stores more often and increasing their basket sizes. There\u2019s still much more to be done, but we\u2019re clearly headed in the right direction. While there, I visited stores as well as our Heston grocery-delivery fulfillment center. I was impressed by how the team is focused on not only improving grocery pick-up and delivery from stores, but also from fulfillment centers in higher-volume environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So overall, the International segment has made steady progress as we find new ways to serve customers more effectively through stores and e-commerce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged with the solid first half results. We are uniquely positioned to deliver the seamless, fast, innovative and exciting shopping experience our customers desire. I\u2019m pleased with how we\u2019re equipping our associates to deliver it. I\u2019d like to thank our associates for their focus on serving customers in all the ways they choose to shop. It\u2019s making a difference. We have a clear strategy that we\u2019re executing against and good momentum across the business. Thanks for your continued interest in Walmart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Brett.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brett Biggs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We had a solid first half of the year. We are improving our competitive position with a differentiated offering by giving customers a better experience in our stores and more of what they want online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are guided by our financial framework to deliver strong, efficient growth, operate with discipline and allocate capital strategically. We are making progress on each element, and it\u2019s through this lens that I\u2019ll discuss our results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.08 was at the top end of our guidance. Walmart U.S. comp sales increased 1.8%, led by traffic growth of 1.3%. U.S. e-commerce GMV grew 67% and International delivered strong results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two items significantly impacted EPS for the quarter. There was a $0.17 negative impact related to the premiums paid for bond tenders, which allowed us to retire higher rate debt to reduce interest expense in future periods. We also recorded a gain from the sale of our Suburbia business in Mexico, which benefited EPS by $0.05.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s also important to remember that during the second quarter of last year, the Company\u2019s EPS was positively impacted by $0.14 related to the gain from the sale of our Yihaodian business in China. Adjusted for these items, EPS increased approximately 1% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross profit margin decreased 11 basis points during the quarter. Strategic price investments in key markets and the growing mix of our e-commerce business reduced the gross margin rate. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes more details on gross margins for each segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to make some progress with expenses as we leveraged expenses in our U.S. stores, as well as in the International segment. As a Company, SG&amp;A delevered by 10 basis points in the period, primarily due to increased technology spending and some impairment charges related to Sam\u2019s Club. We expect to slightly leverage expenses on a consolidated basis for the year. Operating with discipline is important to where we are going in the future. We have a lot of work to do, but I\u2019m encouraged by the focus I\u2019m seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the first six months were solid at $11.4 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively. Compared with last year, the decreases in operating cash flow and free cash flow were due to an increase in incentive payments and the timing of other payments. We are still seeing improvement in working capital, but not as strong as the tremendous improvement last year, which also impacts the year-on-year comparability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of capital allocation, we completed remodels of 283 stores globally, and in the U.S. we further expanded our online grocery service to include more than 900 locations. In addition to investing in the business, we returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For the trailing 12 months ended July 31, 2017, consolidated return on investment decreased 50 basis points due primarily to reduced operating income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now move on to e-commerce. As a reminder, e-commerce results include all web-initiated transactions including those through walmart.com such as ship-to-home, ship-to-store, pick up today and online grocery, as well as transactions through jet.com and the other sites in our family of brands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Walmart U.S. e-commerce again performed very well on the topline as GMV grew 67% and sales increased 60%, including acquisitions. The majority of this growth was organic through walmart.com, including Online Grocery, which is growing quickly. We are delivering growth through an improved customer value proposition that includes free two-day shipping on millions of items and Easy Reorder, as well as an expanded assortment, now with more than 67 million SKUs, an increase of more than 30% from the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With Easy Reorder, we\u2019re integrating both in-store and online purchases to provide customers with a single spot to view and repurchase the items they buy most frequently. Initiatives like these, along with everyday low prices, are the reasons why customers are choosing Walmart in greater numbers. As a reminder, we\u2019ll begin to lap the jet.com acquisition in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s move on to operating segment details. Walmart U.S. delivered another quarter of solid comp sales, increasing 1.8%, led by growth in customer traffic of 1.3%. On a two-year stacked basis, comp sales were up 3.4% and comp traffic increased 2.5%. This marks the 12th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and the 11th consecutive quarter of positive comp traffic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The grocery business continued to improve as food categories delivered the strongest quarterly comp sales performance in five years, led by strong customer traffic and a return of slight market inflation in food, excluding our own price investments. All formats had positive comp sales and e-commerce contributed approximately 70 basis points to the segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Keep in mind the e-commerce sales contribution includes not only purchases that are shipped to a customer\u2019s home, but also omni-channel transactions fulfilled in stores, such as Online Grocery and Pickup Today. Gross margin rate declined five basis points in the quarter. Savings from procuring merchandise benefited the margin rate but was more than offset by the mix effects from our growing e-commerce business, as well as continued investments in price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 13 basis points primarily due to investments in e-commerce and technology. While we didn\u2019t leverage expenses for the overall segment, we did leverage in the stores for the second straight quarter. Service levels remained high and our associates are doing a great job of being more efficient through improved training and by utilizing upgraded technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating income increased 2.2% in the quarter, which is the second straight quarterly increase. Managing inventory has been a key focus for the U.S. business, and the team continues to do a fantastic job in this area. During the quarter, inventory at comp stores fell 3.8%, while in-stock levels remained high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re pleased with the continued momentum at Walmart U.S. in both the digital and physical space. With the third quarter underway, the back-to-school season is in full swing, and we\u2019re providing more options for customers to save time and money in our stores and online. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales to increase between 1.5% and 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s move on to Walmart International. Walmart International continued to execute against its strategic priorities and delivered strong underlying results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2.5% and decreased 1% on a reported basis. Keep in mind, the divestitures of Yihaodian and Suburbia created a headwind to sales of nearly $520 million in the period when compared to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The good performance in the quarter was fairly broad-based, and results at Walmex were particularly strong with comp sales growing more than 7%. Nine of 11 markets posted positive comp sales, including in the U.K., and five of these markets grew comps by more than 5%. As a reminder, the timing of Easter benefited our results for the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating income declined by 2% on a constant currency basis and 7.8% on a reported basis. As I mentioned earlier, there were a few items from international affecting year-over-year performance related to divestitures. The net impact from these divestitures benefited operating income by $415 million this year and $513 million last year in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding these items, operating income grew 5.2% on a constant currency basis. We delivered these results even as we continued to make strategic investments to enhance the shopping experience both in-store and online in several of our major markets. The attention to operating discipline allowed us to leverage expenses in the period, even as we made important investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now turn to some highlights from key markets. The presentation accompanying this transcript includes detailed information on our four major markets. The results discussed below are on a constant currency basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s begin with Walmex, where momentum in sales continued across all countries and regions. Total sales increased 9.2%, excluding Suburbia, and comp sales grew 7.2%. In Mexico, comp sales increased more than 15% on a two-year stacked basis, and each of our merchandise divisions outpaced ANTAD self-service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Canada, net sales increased 3.4%, and comp sales increased 2.5%. We further improved our price position against competitors, which contributed to market share gains in key traffic driving categories such as food and consumables. Inventory was also a focus, as the team reduced overall levels even as sales increased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the UK, net sales increased 3.9%, and comp sales increased 1.8%. Customers responded to investments in the value proposition, and we continued to see sequential improvement in the business, including customer traffic and ticket.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In China, net sales increased 2.5%, and comp sales increased 0.6%. Previously, we highlighted our decision to reduce the mix of bulk sales of certain items in our stores, and while we saw a negative impact to topline results, we believe it was the right decision. Results for the quarter were primarily driven by momentum in the fresh and consumables categories. Additionally, we had good performances with local festivals and holidays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From an e-commerce perspective, we continued to expand our offering through the alliance with JD.com. We now have 134 Walmart stores across 18 cities that have joined the JD Daojia platform, which offers delivery of orders in less than one hour.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to Sam\u2019s Club, comp sales without fuel increased 1.2% in the period, led by traffic growth of 2.1%. We\u2019re serving members across multiple channels, and our e-commerce initiatives produced strong results with 80 basis points of contribution to comp sales and year-over-year growth of 29% or Club Pickup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating income decreased in the period primarily due to a charge of about $50 million as a result of impairments of certain assets and the decision to close four underperforming clubs. The team is moving quickly to execute on their priorities of people, products and digital, and we\u2019re starting to see good traction in categories where we want to win.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe good growth opportunities exist in the club channel, and we know we have to do more to capture greater share in this space. We\u2019re laser focused on our members and how we can serve them in new and exciting ways. For the 13-week period ending October 27, 2017, we expect comp sales without fuel to increase between 1% and 1.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let\u2019s talk about guidance. We\u2019re pleased with our first half performance. Given our results to-date, combined with our expectations for the balance of the year, we now expect full-year adjusted EPS to be $4.30 to $4.40, which includes a range of $0.90 to $0.98 for the third quarter. This compares to previous EPS guidance of $4.20 to $4.40 for the full-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The initial guidance for full-year EPS assumed a negative currency impact of about $0.05 per share, but we now expect the EPS impact from currency will be less given current exchange rates. We continue to assume a full-year effective tax rate around 32%. As with all guidance, this assumes the economic conditions in key markets remains relatively consistent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we\u2019re doing what we said we would do, executing our plan and delivering good results. I continue to be excited about where we\u2019re heading as a Company and how we\u2019re improving our customer\u2019s lives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I close today, let me say thank you to all of our associates around the world for the work you do every day.
