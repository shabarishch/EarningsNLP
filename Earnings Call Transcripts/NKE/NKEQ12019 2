Chairman, President and CEO, Mark Parker.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Parker</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Nitesh, and hello and good afternoon, everyone. Last quarter, we described the growing momentum in our business, and in Q1 that momentum continued at a strong pace. We\u2019re capitalizing on the opportunities we see in the near term and we\u2019re diving deeper into the areas that will widen NIKE\u2019s advantages over the long term. Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we\u2019re taking a winning formula and executing it across our complete portfolio and it\u2019s leading to the balanced growth that you see today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the quarter, NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% on a reported basis. Specific highlights include double-digit growth in our international geographies and 6% growth in North America. NIKE Digital is leading the way for differentiated retail, up 36% for the quarter. And we saw acceleration in both our sportswear and performance businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While this quarter\u2019s success was broad-based and we\u2019re pleased with our momentum, we know we have even more opportunities ahead. As we\u2019ve described before, a key focus that will create separation for NIKE over the long term is our digital transformation. Ultimately, it\u2019s about becoming more personal at scale. And put simply, it\u2019s how digital is accelerating each of our Triple Double pillars. And that\u2019s how we create through 2X Innovation, how we connect through 2X Direct and how we serve through 2X Speed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, let\u2019s look at the quarter through each of these lenses. The success we\u2019re seeing today starts with great products. It\u2019s ultimately where the consumer cast their vote. Our innovation platforms are building a foundation for growth over many years. As the taste of our consumers shifts faster, strong platforms allow us to continually bring fresh products to market while extending our storytelling and investments. We\u2019re seeing it with NIKE Air and React. Consumers are drawn to their comfort and performance and they\u2019re asking for more style options. VaporMax and 270 are both proven there is still vast growth potential in NIKE Air as we develop more comfort innovation in new forms. This spring, we\u2019re taking the exaggerated air you see in the Air Max 270 and going a step further with the introduction of the Air Max 720. This new platform is engineered for maximum comfort, cradling the entire foot. And the Air Max 27 -- or 720 is distinctly NIKE and will deliver it to consumers in early 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">NIKE React is a great example of how we\u2019ve capitalized on the appeal of performance innovation and immediately scaled it into sportswear. The React Element 87 is considered one of the industry\u2019s top new designs, and we\u2019ve applied the comfort of React cushioning to more performance and lifestyle shoes at several price points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ZoomX continues to power the world\u2019s fastest runners including Eliud Kipchoge during his epic world record smashing run at the Berlin Marathon this month. This quarter, we took the magic of the Vaporfly 4% and merged it with an iconic running shoe, creating the Peg Turbo. The launch has created incredible energy for the whole Pegasus franchise and helped lead our overall running business to solid growth this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of our most versatile and ever-advancing platforms is Flyknit. Through digital knitting, we can now place breathability, stretch and support exactly where we need it. In basketball, for example, the KD11 and the LeBron 16, each leverage specific yarns and different knit structures to match individual athlete needs. The LeBron 16 with its Battleknit 2.0 has had a great early read with consumers, both men and women.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As part of our broader commitment to scale sustainable platforms, we\u2019re expanding NIKE Flyleather through iconic styles like the Air Force 1, Cortez and the Air Max 95. Flyleather is a super material that looks and feels like premium leather, but it\u2019s lighter, more durable and more sustainable. It uses at least 50% reclaimed leather and helps eliminate waste.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in the coming year, for the first time ever, NIKE will bring digitally powered adjustable footwear to professional sports. Building on the auto-lacing platform from HyperAdapt, this breakthrough creates a custom fit. We had a group of elite athletes on campus this summer for an intense wear test. And their feedback was that they never felt more secure or more in control of their movement. This next generation adaptable innovation will set the standard for optimal fit. And we\u2019ll offer it at more accessible price points and in greater quantities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to platforms, we\u2019re executing the fundamentals across our categories at a high level right now. We know that it\u2019s newness and freshness that wins with the consumer today. So, with our edit-to-amplify approach, we\u2019re providing deeper assortments and greater options of our top sellers. Our footwear power franchises, for example, consistently outperform our overall footwear sell through. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Apparel too continued its momentum with 11% growth, driven by fleece, tops and bottoms, jackets and pants. We delivered a number of sportswear apparel collections over the last 90 days like the City Ready and the Metallic Sheen collections in women, and NIKE Sport and Tech Pack and ACG. We\u2019ll continue on this path and extending the performance because collections give consumers more complete looks and allow for better merchandising and storytelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall with apparel in our categories, we saw a consistent sell-through of our football national teams collections drafting off the energy we created from the World Cup, where we had our first all-NIKE men\u2019s final.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The growth in our women\u2019s apparel business was led by sportswear and sports bras, where our strategy to blend style and comfort is working.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in NIKE Basketball apparel, we\u2019re capturing the excitement for LeBron\u2019s move to the Lakers. As you\u2019ll see in just a few weeks, we\u2019re bringing more creative designs with the NBA City jerseys this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When we look across our complete portfolio of products, we still see areas with significant upside. We\u2019ve talked before about the opportunity in women in Young Athletes and Jordan. Delivering innovation and fresh product in these areas brings balance to our portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A strong roster of core footwear at entry price points is equally important to NIKE\u2019s overall growth potential. We\u2019re not yet where we want to be in core footwear, particularly in North America. But two priorities for the business are to develop innovation specifically for the core consumer and to better leverage pinnacle performance platforms like NIKE Air in this zone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another product strategy that\u2019s driving incredible energy is our ability to create unique intersections between sport and style across our brand. A few examples over this past quarter include the on and off court collaboration between Serena and Virgil Abloh for the U.S. Open; Converse\u2019s limited edition Chuck Taylors and One Stars with creative partners in fashion and music; and our first Jordan Brand football kit with PSG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I said before, it\u2019s not lifestyle versus performance or fashion versus sports, the consumer continues to be inspired by seeing those worlds come together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, 2X Innovation is at the heart of our continued momentum right now. We have versatile platforms; we\u2019re mixing sport and style in unexpected ways; and we have a deep line-up across our product portfolio that\u2019s creating value across all dimensions of our business. And while our product innovation is fueling demand, our 2X Direct strategy is driving new ways to connect with our consumers. It\u2019s building confidence in our vision for smart retail, where we remove friction and personalize experiences through the intersection of digital and physical environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2X Direct is in the early stages, and it\u2019s already creating an impact, resulting in strong growth and margin expansion for our NIKE Direct channels. We continue to see unprecedented demand for our highest heat product through our SNKRS app, which has become the world\u2019s number one footwear shopping app. And we\u2019ll continue to expand the reach of SNKRS, launching in Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The NIKE Live retail concept, we unveiled with our Melrose store in LA was incredibly successful this quarter. The premise behind the concept is to create a live and ever-changing experience. We\u2019re testing a number of new features including product assortments that update frequently based on what\u2019s trending with the local consumer; a service that allows consumers to reserve an item on our apps and then pick it up curbside or in the store from a personal smart locker. And through Swoosh text, our store athletes can now provide expert advice for consumers after they\u2019ve left the store.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what we\u2019re learning in Melrose, we\u2019re bringing to 2 new flagship stores in our 2 most important key cities, New York and Shanghai this next quarter. Both will be the combination of all we\u2019ve learned about personalized and experiential shopping over the last several years. There\u2019ll be incredible showcases for the NIKE brand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our obsession with the store experience is also paying off with top strategic partners. While retail consolidation has not finished its course in North America, our growing NIKE consumer experiences with Foot Locker, Nordstrom and other key partners are already driving higher growth rates as compared to non-differentiated doors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re equally energized by the momentum we\u2019re building with new digital commerce partners. We just moved from a pilot stage to a fully operational program with Flipkart in India. And 2 weeks ago, we announced a new partnership with Jet.com to sell selected assortment of both NIKE and Converse in key cities in North America. With Jet, we\u2019re partnering to develop consumer insights and create a better branded experience on their platform. And we\u2019re doing same with our key partners in China. This quarter, we made it possible to combine NikePlus member accounts to Tmall accounts. We\u2019re seeing an impressive increase in new members in China as a result. And lastly, we launched partnership with WeChat, making 1 billion monthly active users just one click away from becoming a NikePlus member.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ultimately companies will be judged on their ability to be more personal with their consumers at scale. And NIKE\u2019s taking a lead on this promise, leveraging more insights from all over the world and reshaping the shopping experience through smart retail. To make that a reality, we\u2019re unlocking opportunities to quickly and seamlessly design, manufacture and deliver our products to consumers through 2X Speed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re sharpening our sensing capabilities and develop a fully responsive product manufacturing. We\u2019re actively building a portfolio of innovation and automation that impacts the entire spectrum of our process. Our goals are ambitious and we have high standards. Our vision is to leverage automation to deliver amazing innovative products, faster and more responsively, while being more sustainable and cost efficient. And we\u2019ve had some great success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, we invented a flat assembly process for uppers in our Advanced Product Creation Center at our World Headquarters using 30% fewer steps and 50% less labor. We tested this process with our partners including Flex and in our Asia store space as well. Transforming traditional footwear manufacturing is a significant undertaking. We\u2019ve learned a lot and are building new high-impact capabilities, yet we continue to face specific challenges together with our partners including Flex where the goal has been to deliver responsive, automated, close to market manufacturing of high-quality product at scale. This is a dynamic process and we\u2019re continually assessing and refining the best path forward, leveraging our breakthroughs in areas like rapid prototyping, 3D and digital printing, and new methods of make all in service of cutting the overall product creation cycle in half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another key initiative accelerating us towards that goal is the Express Lane, which continues to be the engine that\u2019s creating the most agility in our supply chain right now. We\u2019re driving double-digit growth in many of our key cities through the Express Lane as we capitalize on the local energy for key icons like the Cortez and sports moments like the World Cup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With this end-to-end view, our entire value chain, we\u2019re delivering the right product to the right consumer in the right moment. And across product lines, through GOs [ph] and with our partners around the world, we\u2019re relentlessly driving speed at a scale that is creating impact for our business. We\u2019re off to a great start in Q1, managing the dynamic environment. More importantly, we\u2019re setting a new foundation for long-term, sustainable growth for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. And now, here is Andy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andy Campion</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are extremely pleased with the quality of the growth that we delivered in the first quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we are delivering stronger, more broad-based momentum around the world than the expectations we set entering the fiscal year. We had continued strong growth in international markets, led by Greater China growing at 20%, and our international growth is now being amplified by very strong, sustainable growth in North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As for the quality of our growth, our momentum continues to be directly tied to execution of the Consumer Direct Offense and more specifically, the Triple Double. First, take, for example, our 2X Direct initiative. 2X Direct is about connecting the NIKE brand more directly to our consumers. And today, the most direct connection to the consumer is through the mobile device in the palm of their hand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Q1, we continued to enhance and expand our NIKE Digital ecosystem, leading with mobile, and the result was 36% NIKE Digital growth. NIKE Digital was once again our fastest growing channel in each and every geography.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, while NIKE Digital is leading the way, we believe physical retail will also play an important role in doubling our direct connection to consumers. We see growth in the physical environment being driven by smarter retail, experiences that leverage digital technology to better serve consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Q1, our vision for physical retail became more tangible. We continued to roll out what we\u2019re calling the NIKE app at retail, starting with our own in line stores. And we also launched a new concept called NIKE Live. The NIKE Live concept came to life in Q1 through the opening of NIKE by Melrose in Los Angeles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">NIKE Live leverages our NikePlus membership platform and other digitally enabled services to provide a truly differentiated consumer experience at retail. The results to-date have been phenomenal. For example, at NIKE by Melrose, the conversion of in-store shoppers into digital NikePlus members is 6 times higher than in the rest of our fleet, as consumers seek to gain the full benefits associated with being more directly connected to NIKE. Our approach has been to task, learn and then scale new concepts such as these. Accordingly, we\u2019re now in the process of scaling these new concepts across our fleet of own stores. And these tangible proof points are also accelerating new concept development with our strategic wholesale partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2X Innovation is another key pillar within the Consumer Direct Offense that is fueling our broad-based momentum. Suffice it to say that our recently launched innovation platforms VaporMax, Air Max 270, React and ZoomX have already generated in aggregate over $2 billion in revenue at retail. Further, these platforms are driving brand distinction and catalyzing growth across our broader product portfolio in both performance and sportswear. For example, as Mark noted, the new innovation we are bringing to the NIKE Air franchise has ignited double-digit growth across our multibillion dollar family of NIKE Air products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Newness and innovation are also favorably impacting our gross margin, as our full price sell-through is significantly outpacing off-price sales. Our current inventory levels are also tight in relation to the strong demand that we\u2019re creating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Underlying our strategic momentum is the digital transformation of NIKE that Mark mentioned. A year ago, we aligned our teams around the world on our new strategy, the Consumer Direct Offense. Over the past year, we\u2019ve been ramping up investment in the new digital capabilities that will reshape how we operate at NIKE for the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our investments in new digital capabilities are coming in the form of both organic development and acquisitions. As we closed fiscal year \u201818, we announced the acquisitions of Zodiac and Invertex, both of which are already having a profound impact on how we better serve consumers. Another acquisition that we made back in fiscal year \u201817 was Virgin Mega. That team has now become known as Studio 23 at digital hub in New York that\u2019s driving the explosive growth of the SNKRS app.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Within fiscal year \u201819, we\u2019re also investing significantly in the organic development of new capabilities, including digital demand sensing, consumer data and analytics, connected inventory, digital product design and creation, a digital content engine and a new enterprise resource platform that will help unlock speed and flexibility in our supply chain. As our long-term financial model implies, we believe that NIKE\u2019s unrivaled scale and resources afford us the ability to over-index on investment in these differentiating capabilities, while still delivering expanding profitability over the five-year horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is clearly beginning to transform NIKE\u2019s business model and how we will create value for shareholders over the long term. So, let\u2019s recap our Q1 results in a bit more detail with a focus on how strategic execution is the driving force behind our current financial performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">NIKE, Inc. Q1 revenue increased 10%, up 9% on a currency-neutral basis. Our stronger than projected currency-neutral growth was driven by acceleration in North America and continued strong momentum in international markets, albeit slightly offset by FX dynamics within the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our growth across geographies was led by NIKE Direct with NIKE Direct growing 12% and NIKE Digital growing 34% on a currency-neutral basis. The impact of innovation, NIKE</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Digital growth outpacing all other channels, and our tighter supply and demand management also fueled roughly 50 basis points of NIKE, Inc.\u2019s gross margin expansion in Q1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Demand creation grew 13% in the first quarter, primarily driven by sports marketing investments, as well as brand campaigns that amplified key moment sport such as the World Cup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating overhead increased 5%, driven by investments in digital capabilities, as well as in our supply chain and enterprise technology platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 14%, which reflects the implementation of U.S. tax reform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.67. Finally, as of August 31st, inventories reflect to prior year, primarily driven by a strong pull market across all geographies, coupled with the efforts we\u2019ve taken over the past year to right size supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, now, let\u2019s turn to the financial performance for our reported operating segments. In North America, we have returned to strong sustainable growth. Q1 revenue grew 6% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, led by a accelerating growth across both footwear and apparel, driven by new innovation platforms as well as strong owned and partnered digital growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wholesale has also returned to growth, yet we see even greater opportunity to drive differentiation across the wholesale marketplace going forward, in part by leveraging our learnings from the NIKE app at retail and NIKE by Melrose.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another growth opportunity we see ahead of us in North America relates the Jordan Brand. In the second half of fiscal year \u201818, we tightened supply. We also reset our approach to Jordan Retro, creating more current stories and collaborations with respect to Jordan\u2019s most iconic styles. We\u2019re now bringing those icons to life in more compelling ways for the new generation of Jordan consumers. And as a result, the Jordan Brand is back to a pull market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also beginning to have greater dimension for the Jordan Brand, for example for women, we\u2019re extending sizes and the icons we know they already love and also creating silhouettes and new collaborations made specifically for her. Apparel and performance basketball also represents significant growth opportunities going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the football and basketball seasons ramp up, our brand momentum will continue to build in North America. At the same time, we\u2019re not taking that momentum for granted. We continue to identify and attack opportunities to elevate our game and drive strong, sustainable growth in this important geography.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, now, let\u2019s turn to EMEA. In EMEA, Q1 revenue grew 9% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong growth in sportswear and healthy growth in Running and Jordan. NIKE Digital led all dimensions of the marketplace, growing at a strong double-digit rate. One of the underlying drivers of our sustained growth in EMEA is the strength of our brand across this diverse geography. EMEA accounted 5 of our 12 key global cities, and in all 5 of those key cities in EMEA, NIKE is rated number one by consumers, and our growth is over-indexing in the broader market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By connecting more deeply with consumers in key influential cities and by amplifying the biggest moments in sport, NIKE is creating increasingly greater distinction as a brand in Europe. One of those sports moments was the incredibly exciting World Cup in which both of the finalists were NIKE teams. And soon after the World Cup final, we launched our Awaken the Phantom campaign, generating over 50 million views in the first few weeks and driving strong sell through on the launch of our newest global footwall franchise, the Phantom. And finally, after celebrating the French National Team\u2019s World Cup victory, we continue to bring energy to global football with the launch of a Jordan branded Paris Saint-German team kit and collection of apparel. That launch has been phenomenal with the key style selling out immediately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While NIKE has become the leading brand in EMEA, we are far from having achieved our full potential. We see the opportunity to both grow the market for athletic footwear and apparel across Europe, and also create even greater separation from the competition as a brand. That is why we believe we can sustain the strong growth in EMEA over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, let\u2019s turn to Greater China, another geography in which the NIKE brand continues to lead and sustain strong growth. We\u2019ve now delivered 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth in Greater China. In Q1, Greater China\u2019s growth was 20% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by Sportswear, Jordan, Basketball and across Women\u2019s and Young Athletes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Growth was also strong in balance across both footwear and apparel. We are winning with the Chinese consumer, first and foremost through the key cities of Shanghai and Beijing. We\u2019re also continually innovating in this large, digitally native marketplace. NIKE Digital growth remained strong and actually accelerated in Q1. We\u2019re also driving growth through our partnerships with China\u2019s leading digital platforms like Tmall and WeChat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, we\u2019re beginning to leverage digital in the largely NIKE branded physical retail environment in China. Say for example, our partner Bai Li [ph], which was acquired last year by Hillhouse, [ph] a leading firm in technology and consumer services. Bai Li [ph] has already rolled out connected inventory that enables a more direct Nike consumer experience with a faster and easier way to fulfill consumer demand, fully leveraging their roughly 2,500 touch points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s turn from China to another fast-growing and fast-developing geography, APLA. In Q1, APLA revenue grew 14% on a currency-neutral basis, fueled by balanced double-digit growth across footwear and apparel and led by Japan, Mexico, and Korea. Two areas of increasing focus for us in APLA have been our women\u2019s business and digital. Women\u2019s growth continues to accelerate, driven by distinctive brand marketing campaigns such as the Come Out in Force, and Rally Cry campaigns focused on inspiring and empowering women through sport.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">NIKE Digital is also accelerating in APLA with revenue growing over 70% in Q1, the highest rate of growth across all of our geographies as we continue expanding our digital ecosystem across this region. We will continue to sustain strong growth as we roll out the NIKE SNKRS app in markets such as Mexico and Brazil, and bring the NIKE Live retail concept to Tokyo later this fiscal year. Beyond NIKE Direct, we\u2019re also expanding our digital connectivity to consumers across this region through entrepreneurial commerce partnerships such as those with Flipkart, ZOZOTOWN and several others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We see continued momentum in APLA over the course of fiscal year \u201819 and we will continue to invest in this fast-growing diverse geography as we move even closer to the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, at Converse, revenue increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis. Growth was fueled by double-digit revenue growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth digitally. That said, Converse also experienced declines in undifferentiated wholesale, primarily in the U.S. and the UK. As we move through fiscal year \u201819, we will be expanding Converse\u2019s product portfolio while also elevating the Converse branded digital ecosystem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are off to an even stronger start to the fiscal year than we initially expected. Our currency-neutral growth and profitability is exceeding our expectations. At the same time, global trade uncertainty and geopolitical dynamics have resulted in the dollar strengthening and foreign exchange shifting to a slight headwind over the past 90 days. Taking into account all of these dynamics, we are maintaining our full year guidance for fiscal year \u201819. Specifically, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits, albeit at the lower end of that range as operational upside will likely be somewhat offset by FX headwinds. We expect gross margin to expand 50 basis points or slightly greater, SG&amp;A to grow in the high single digits and our effective tax rate to be in the mid teens. Other expense net of interest expense is now projected to be an expense of $100 million to $125 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on the FX volatility of late, let me briefly explain more specifically how FX impacts NIKE\u2019s financials in the short term. First, it\u2019s important to note that the revenue line item in our P&amp;L is essentially unhedged. Therefore, our reported real dollar revenue growth reflects nearly all currency movements real time. We do have a robust hedging program that delays the impact of FX on our profitability for 12 to as much as 24 months, most notably with respect to developed market currencies, for example, the euro. However, it is not economical to hedge FX risk in many emerging markets such as Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil. And as for China, we\u2019re able to partially, but not fully hedge our net exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our focus is on sustaining strong, currency-neutral operating momentum over the full year and even more importantly, over the longer term. But, I\u2019ll provide a bit of context on Q2. For Q2, we expect strong currency-neutral revenue growth in line with the 9% currency-neutral revenue growth we delivered in Q1. That said, taking into account real time FX dynamics, reported real dollar revenue growth for Q2 is likely to be 2 to 3 points lower than our currency-neutral revenue growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For gross margin, we expect Q2 expansion approaching the same level of expansion that we delivered in Q1. As a reminder, we expect less gross margin expansion in the first half of the year, as compared to the second half of the year. In Q2, we expect SG&amp;A growth in the low-teens driven by the timing of our investments in sports marketing, including the kick-off of the NBA and NFL seasons, and the timing of strategic investments in new digital capabilities. For other expense, net of interest expense, we expect expense in Q2 to be in the $30 million to $40 million range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our execution of the Consumer Direct Offense is creating brand distinction with consumers around the world and driving strong financial performance. At the same time, we see ourselves as being in the early stages of this transformation. There is no finish line for NIKE, particularly as it relates to digital. So, we will continue to invest in the capabilities that will differentiate and create competitive advantage for NIKE long-term. Those capabilities include product innovation, brand marketing, digital, and speed within our supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are thrilled with our momentum out of the gate in fiscal year \u201819. And nonetheless, we remain on the offense, identifying and attacking opportunities to elevate our game, build on our momentum with consumers, and ensure that we deliver sustainable, profitable, capital-efficient growth over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, we\u2019ll now open up the call for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kate McShane</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at the 6% North America growth you saw this quarter, I wondered if you could help us understand how much is being driven by ASP growth versus unit growth, and how much of a drag is the undifferentiated retail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Andy Campion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Kate. It\u2019s Andy. I\u2019ll take that one. In North America, we\u2019re actually seeing expansion in average selling prices as well as units. Our growth is relatively well-balanced, as you saw in our reporting across footwear and apparel. So, it\u2019s very strong and balanced growth. And we see that strong and balanced growth continuing over the balance of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kate McShane</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Andy Campion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And for undifferentiated retail, as I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing growth across all dimensions of the marketplace. We have had relatively strong growth with our strategic wholesale partners being Foot Locker, Finish Line, Dick\u2019s and others. That\u2019s being driven by the elevation of the consumer experience with those partners and also by the extraordinary impact of the new innovation and newness that we\u2019re bringing to our product portfolio. We\u2019re in the early stages of some of the more truly transformational change. But, what we\u2019re really encouraged by is that the learnings that we\u2019re having, particularly with the Nike app at retail and Nike by Melrose, in other words, the Nike Live concept. Those conversations are really picking up steam in terms of new concept development that we see a great opportunity for across that bricks and mortar fleet in wholesale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I\u2019ll add that the demand that we\u2019re seeing in North America is actually quite balanced across the portfolio. And on top of that the inventory situation is actually quite clean as that demand has been increasing. So, we\u2019re in a good position here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess, the question that I have is more of a bigger picture question for you. I was wondering if you could address your demand creation advertising marketing approach. There has been a little bit of news the last couple of weeks and some controversy around it. And I was just wondering if you could maybe address how you approach these types of situations, the concerns that you have but the benefits that you see around certain campaigns?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, just generally, we\u2019re motivated to inspire our consumer to connect and engage and inspire. We feel actually very good and very proud of the work that we\u2019re doing with Just Do It, introducing Just Do It to the new generation of consumers, on the 30th anniversary of the campaign when it first debuted. We know it\u2019s resonated actually quite strongly with consumers. Obviously, here, in North America but also around the world, it\u2019s really transcended to North America market to touch people around the world. We have an incredible line up of athletes in that spot. When you look at the Just Do It campaign and the list of athletes we have there, it\u2019s actually quite impressive including Serena and Odell, Colin, Shaquem Griffin, Lacey Baker, these are actually very inspiring athletes. And again, we feel like that campaign has delivered on that that message in a way that\u2019s really connected with people around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Like any campaign, it\u2019s -- not any campaign but many campaigns, it\u2019s driving a real uptake, I think in traffic and engagement, both socially as well as commercially. We\u2019ve seen record engagement with the brand as part of the campaign. And our brand strength, as you well know, is key dimension that contributes to the ongoing momentum that we\u2019re building across the NIKE portfolio. And that\u2019s really how we look at it. It is how do we connect and engage in a way that\u2019s relevant and inspiring to the consumers that we are here to serve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Drbul</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks. And I guess, the second good question I have is, after this weekend\u2019s golf results, I was wondering if you had any perspective on how Phil Mickelson feels ahead of the match-play event in November with Tiger?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. He\u2019s probably feeling more pressure, I would imagine. It\u2019s great to see Tiger back and the reaction to his performance on Sunday was pretty inspiring. So, yes, I think Phil might be feeling little bit of that pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Lauren Cassel with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lauren Cassel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, is there any color you can share on North America DTC growth specifically during the quarter? And then, just bigger picture, there\u2019s been some caution or nervousness in the market about potential slow down in the Chinese economy and consumer spending there. Obviously, you guys delivered some really nice growth there this quarter. But, are there any fines or signals that you\u2019re seeing that would suggest a slowdown there? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Andy Campion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I will take North America NIKE Direct or DTC, as you put it, growth. I\u2019ll hit it on all three dimensions. We had extremely strong double-digit growth in digital and acceleration in that regard. We have taken a number of actions to remove friction, enhance the consumer experience, allocates product to that channel where we know consumers\u2019 demand is robust. And we\u2019re actually using data and demand sensing to better lineup supply with demand digitally. So, incredibly strong growth digitally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our in-line stores, we\u2019re actually seeing strong comps as well. We\u2019ve seen traffic up and even more notably conversion. And conversion in the in-line stores we\u2019re seeing as a direct result of two things. One, the brand distinction that Mark mentioned in response to the last question as well as the product that we\u2019re bringing to market; we\u2019re seeing incredibly strong full price sell-through on our line right now, our closeout mix is down in inventory and are off price sales are down as a percent of total.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our factory stores, our factory stores continue to be a very profitable dimension of the business. And frankly, the only challenge I would really highlight in our factory stores is that its full price sell-through is so strong and in-line and digitally, it leaves some gaps in terms of the assortment that we bring to market in the short-term in our factory stores. But, we\u2019ve identified opportunities in that regard and are looking at supply to fill those gaps. So, again, it\u2019s a nice </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, it\u2019s a nice problem to have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Let me touch on China. Yes. I mean, as Andy has mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019ve seen 17 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and really strong underlying fundamentals within the market, things -- factors like the growth of the middle class, sports participation, obviously a very digitally savvy consumer, and we\u2019re well-positioned in that regard in the marketplace. In terms of the NIKE brand and its position, we have a very strong connection with the Chinese consumer. We have for a long time, we\u2019re leading the market in digital, growing 40% in Q1. We\u2019ve had great relationships with our digital partners there; I mentioned Tmall, WeChat is starting up with the tremendous potential there. So, there\u2019s great momentum in the marketplace and across multiple categories, sportswear, running, basketball. The Jordan Brand is incredibly strong in China. So our fundamentals in China are actually quite silent and strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re not seeing any pushback from consumers. On the contrary, our relationship with actually consumers is strong as they can possibly be. We feel confident in our ability to continue to grow, and that\u2019s reflected in our outlook for China over this next year. And we feel like there\u2019s great momentum and that we\u2019re in a good position for that to continue. Now, that said, we\u2019re mindful of the dynamics. But, we are focused on serving that Chinese consumer, strengthening our position there. And I\u2019ll just I guess close by saying, we are the most popular brand with the Chinese consumer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Your lines open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Duffy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good balance in the quarter, a lot of good indicators. The inventory looks well-managed and you\u2019re seeing strong results in DTC and also spoke about improving margin from DTC. I\u2019m wondering, can you speak about some of the elements of cost inflation that are offsetting the mix benefits in the gross margin. And Andy, can you detail the FX impact considered in the gross margin outlook for the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Andy Campion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I\u2019ll hit both dynamics, cost and FX. But, let me first give you a little bit of overall context on our margins. We\u2019re seeing strong structural improvement in our margins, and that\u2019s being driven by the innovation we\u2019re bringing to market and in turn the strong full price versus off price mix. Second, it\u2019s being driven by the over indexing growth in our NIKE Digital business. And it\u2019s also being amplified by the initiatives that we have around product cost management. In the first half of the year, there is one element of material so to speak that it\u2019s a bit of a headwind, and that\u2019s in the chemical space, namely rubber. That will ease in the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look at FX as well, FX is much more of a tailwind in the margin line item of our P&amp;L in the second half of the year, as compared to the first half of the year. So, if I refer back to the guidance that we gave as we entered the year and we reiterated today, we have strong gross margin expansion forecast for the entire fiscal year. At the same time, we see slightly less margin expansion in the first half and more margin expansion in the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Duffy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very good. And then Mark for you. Last nine months, particularly strong period for new product introductions and bringing new innovation to the marketplace. Can you talk about how to think about the cadence from here? Will there be a gap or is there a predictable launch cycle you expect to work with as we look out over the next couple of years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Our 2X Innovation initiative is really all about a steady flow of innovation. I feel very positive, very confident with what\u2019s in the innovation pipeline and what\u2019s coming. I mentioned a couple of things earlier. The new iterations of our Air cushioning platform with the 720, a very exciting product that\u2019s building on the VaporMax and 270. So, that\u2019s exciting. I also mentioned the adaptable -- adaptive footwear technology coming into performance sport, and you\u2019ll see that on professional athletes very soon. We have an incredible lineup coming I think throughout the fiscal year of product. We\u2019re actually focusing on bringing innovation into the core price points as well. So, we have a balanced portfolio of innovation across both footwear and apparel. And then we have opportunity to further dimensionalize the incredible platforms that we\u2019ve got. I mean, I mentioned Air, React, ZoomX. There\u2019s still a tremendous amount of potential to leverage those, both in performance across categories and then also across sportswear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, I have to tell you, I can\u2019t really shed too much light on this at this stage, but my excitement around what\u2019s coming as we, believe it or not, ramp up our portfolio around the Tokyo Olympics. NIKE is -- that\u2019s always a time where we showcase our innovation and the build up to the Olympics is an incredibly exciting time for NIKE, and the innovation that we deliver. So, I guarantee you, we won\u2019t disappoint with some of the things we have coming up. And you\u2019ll start to see some of that ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Solid results. Just on North America, given the acceleration that we saw throughout the first quarter, is it fair to assume that the exit rate was more in the high single-digit range? And while I know overall global revenue outlook has not changed, has your thought process on what is achievable in North America maybe been upped a little bit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Andy Campion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thanks for the complements, Paul. And I\u2019ll take that one. Our goals for North America are long-term focused. It\u2019s a large important geography. And as you may recall, at our Investor Day in October, we said we were targeting mid single digit revenue growth over the next five years, as we innovate within the marketplace from a digital perspective and transform the broader retail landscape. On that note, we said there might be some disruption in the short-term as well. So, to some extent, we hedged a little bit with respect to fiscal year \u201819.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To be clear, we\u2019ve returned to strong growth in North America, even faster than we had expected. We have demand that is outstripping supply. You saw our inventory in North America was flat. And so, what we\u2019re focused on and we\u2019re always focused on, you can rest assured is capitalizing on every opportunity that we see to serve demand in the North America marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re not providing specific guidance from a geo perspective. But, I will tell you that the brand is incredibly strong, our product\u2019s resonating, sell-through is strong. And even beyond what\u2019s working and what you can see in our numbers, we see opportunity to go beyond that and potentially even more importantly drive that sustainable growth over that five-year horizon. And those opportunities fall under the overall umbrella of what Mark often refers to as our complete offense. So, at any given time, even when we have extraordinary momentum, there are areas underneath that umbrella where we see greater opportunity than we\u2019re capitalizing on. Specifically in North America, I touched on Jordan. We see acceleration in Jordan over the coming months and certainly out of this fiscal year and into next year. Women\u2019s is growing strong. Women\u2019s was very strong dimension of growth for us as a company. But we see even more opportunity, it\u2019s not so much about the rate of growth, it\u2019s how much more opportunity is out there in the women\u2019s business, especially around athletic footwear and apparel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, finally, another dimension, a huge opportunity in North America is our Young Athletes business. It may surprise some people to know that it\u2019s one of our largest categories. At the same time, we see the opportunity to bring new materials, colors, prints, and even designs directly targeted at young athletes. We have a silhouette called the Future Series, which is actually an innovation that\u2019s made specifically for kids. So, we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity in North America. Suffice it to say, we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum we have and we\u2019re bullish on being able to sustain growth in North America in fiscal year \u201819 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, you also asked about global growth. You made a comment that said it\u2019s pretty consistent. I just want to be clear, on a currency-neutral basis, our momentum on the top line from a revenue perspective is stronger globally than we expected when we came into the year. While we maintained our high single digit reported revenue growth guidance that takes into account that over the last 90 days since we last spoke to you, FX has been pretty volatile. And as I touched on that line item in our P&amp;L is essentially unhedged. So, while we protect the profitability through hedging, we see those impacts real time and that\u2019s also why I gave you a little bit more color on Q2 guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your last question comes from Jamie Merriman with Bernstein. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Merriman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much. Andy, you touched on how you\u2019re using data, a little bit earlier, but I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about, is it inventory allocation by channel, by geography, is some of that data starting to help drive your product creation efforts and are there other ways that it\u2019s being deployed at this point? And then, just as follow-up, you talked about the Jet.com partnership. Can you just talked about how that compares to the Amazon partnership? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Andy Campion</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I\u2019ll start with data and analytics. It is truly an end to end initiative at NIKE. It starts with consumer data and analysis around consumer data. And I\u2019d say, that is manifesting itself right now already and most importantly, in terms of digital demand sensing. Us continuing to leverage the intuition that we have, but amplifying that intuition with real data as to what consumers preferences are. And one of the best examples is NIKE by Melrose. That store, that NIKE Live store in Los Angeles, the entire assortment is based on data that we\u2019re analyzing around what consumers in those ZIP codes have purchased and are interested in and some of the key themes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You move from digital demand sensing to digital product creation. So, taking that insight and designing and creating product leveraging digital technology that allows us to bring that insight to life in a product faster. And then, absolutely, we\u2019re using data in our supply chain to tighten our demand and supply management. And you see that already beginning to impact our full price versus off price sell-through. On the very front end, of course, from a consumer perspective, data and analytics helps us personalize the consumer experience on the NIKE app, as well as the SNKRS app, and even in our physical retail environment, as we use things like the NIKE app at retail. And in that regard, one of the most notable successes or pilots early on has been connected inventory. So, using RFID and using data and analytics, in terms of where inventory is and where consumers are looking to buy to get them the product they want more seamlessly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, as for your second question, you asked about Jet.com and how that might compare to some of our other partnerships. And I\u2019ll say that -- Mark will probably want to add something here, we\u2019re excited about this partnership with Jet because it is a partnership that is really about creating a compelling consumer experience around the NIKE brand, leveraging NIKE membership to help better serve consumers in that channel, helping ensure that there\u2019s a clean assortment of product that\u2019s presented to that consumer across the marketplace. So, there are several aspects of it that we view as distinctive in terms of the offering that we\u2019ll make to consumers. At the same time, it\u2019s one of several initiatives across a range of digital commerce platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Parker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I\u2019ll just add on Jet. We\u2019re starting off with a more focused pilot as we look at offering a select amount of product in key cities across North America. It\u2019s an assortment that\u2019s tailored to those consumers, what we would call a brand friendly shopping experience. We\u2019re looking at our digital partners to help co-create elevated consumer experiences and how they partner with NIKE. And so, we can work together on advancing our connection to consumers through digital commerce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are looking at how we partner with these digital platforms to advance the consumer connection in terms of product selection, in terms personal service, in terms of how the brand is presented online. And we\u2019re optimistic and feel very strong that the relationship with Jet.com is going to offer us those opportunities. So, we\u2019re excited about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Amazon, our business with Amazon is performing well, not a huge update here, other than we\u2019ve seen really good sell-through on a limited selection of products that we\u2019ve offered. We\u2019ve said before that we want to work together to elevate the consumer experience, and that\u2019s important in any digital partnership that we enter into. We get the most out of our relationship when we work together to elevate that brand presentation. And one of the things we\u2019re going to continue to focus on is how we share data with our digital partners to advance that consumer experience. But we feel like the partnership with the Amazon is working or moving toward a mutually beneficial space. So, we\u2019re actually feeling good about where we are. And it\u2019s important that we stay focused and continue to look for those opportunities together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Nitesh Sharan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent.
