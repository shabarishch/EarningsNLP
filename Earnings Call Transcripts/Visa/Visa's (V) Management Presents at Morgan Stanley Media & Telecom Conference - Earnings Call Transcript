I'm James Faucette, Head of U.S. Payments and FinTech.</p> <p>And before we get started, I have a quick disclosure to read. That is that for important disclosures, please see morganstanley.com/researchdisclosures. And I'm very pleased today to have Oliver Jenkyn, Group President &amp; Regional President for North America for Visa joining us to talk about Visa. And Oliver, before we get started, I have to say, I've done hundreds and hundreds, maybe 1000s of these. And I think you bear the most resemblance in Ellie's via video to your bio picture of anybody I've seen. So it's something that jumped out of me in this virtual environment. So I just wanted to mention that nice work.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Jenkyn</strong></p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p><strong>Q - James Faucette</strong></p> <p>Maybe I'll start with like, the biggest topic that we get questions on, particularly from potential incremental investors in Visa and that is Crypto, Bitcoin, et cetera. What is Visa\u2019s roadmap? What are you doing already like, how are you looking at the Crypto or Bitcoin specifically as a potential player in the financial services space?</p> <p><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p>Certainly is I agree, a lot of talk around Cryptocurrencies and digital currencies, et cetera. At Visa, we think Crypto could be meaningful, and we've been investing in it for a while now, accordingly. We think in the Crypto space, we're uniquely positioned to help make it more secure, more functional, more useful and more practical and hence, we were excited to be involved.</p> <p>But let me<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> take a step back and start at the beginning for how we look at Crypto, we look at it in sort of two segments. There's Cryptocurrencies, which represents sort of new asset classes like Bitcoin. These are predominantly held as assets, as investments not really used as a medium of exchange for purchases, they're sort of<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> like our CEO, Al Kelly often a person was like digital gold. And then you've got digital currencies that are stable coins, which are backed one-for-one with fiat currencies. And these are a different kind of emerging payment innovation that could actually have more of a direct impact on commerce and business, like any other fiat currency. But across those are sort of like four areas where we're very involved with both types of those digital currencies.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First is purchase. This one's simple, but talking to wallets and exchanges to use Visa Credentials to purchase cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin or digital currency, very simple, but very important to make the whole thing work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second is cash out. So working with users of Crypto exchanges or wallets, to be able to have people cash out onto a Visa credential. So if you're holding a million dollars in Bitcoin, and you want to go out to dinner, it's pretty hard to go and do that. But if you put a Visa credential on the front end of that Crypto asset account, then you can actually use that that asset value anywhere. So that's important for us. We have partnerships with 35 of the large crypto wallets and exchanges, including Coinbase, Crypto.com, BlockFi et cetera. And so we continue to work on that, we think those partnerships could yield 50 million plus new Visa credentials. It also, if we had more time as opportunities in the cross-border B2B space as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The third area we're working here is APIs and offering APIs for our financial services and FinTech partners, to be able to offer the ability to purchase cryptocurrencies. So for example, if you're out of say, a regional bank in the United States, and you want to be able to offer the ability to purchase, say Bitcoins through your online banking site or your mobile app, we can extend our APIs to that regional bank so that they can purchase custody and trade Bitcoin, relatively simply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the fourth area is settlements. We've upgraded our infrastructure to enable partners to settle with us in digital currency starting with USDC stablecoin. As you guys know, we transacted 160 currencies, we settle in 25. And we can add digital currencies as an additional transaction and settlement currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess if there's one last thing I'd say, we're increasingly having conversations with central banks, as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency CBDC and we're talking to them about how they think about design, et cetera. So there's a lot of talk, but there's actually a lot of action alongside that as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Interesting and -- this is a topic that actually you could spend hours on, but I know we want to hit a lot of different things. So maybe we'll try to move rapidly through kind of the key topics as they're today. And come back and dive in if we have time or on a future date, but post COVID-19 we've seen really strong growth in debit in COVID. And at the same time COVID-related headwinds have been persisting in credit. And they could be because of the way stimulus has been distributed plus just behavior et cetera. Can you talk about the trends that we've seen thus far in 2021? And what expects -- what Visa expects volumes to look like post-COVID 2019? Is there -- are we permanently in this debit/credit mix the way we're today? Or does it shift back more to credit? How are you planning for that in your business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good question. So let me start at a high-level and I'll go more specific as we go. Certainly, COVID has had a huge impact in terms of how people buy things and how they choose to pay. I think we're all familiar with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at the main trends that we've seen, since COVID hit which are still true in 2021 they're very consistent with these trends. But again, great as you point out, great strength in debit, weakness in credit, strong domestic spending, very strong e-commerce as we pulled forward, three, four, five years of customer habituation and muscle memory formation, we pulled that forward across all segments, we think that'll stay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cross-border, the positive side has been e-commerce cross-border; obviously, cross-border travel is stubbornly low and will be for a while yet. Acceleration of captive pays is another key trend, G2C government's actually using digital payments more than other trend we've seen. So those are the trends that have been around since the beginning. They're still true in 2021. And we expect them to continue for a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On your specific question, debit versus credit. Let me just read my notes here on a couple data points. Globally, our fiscal first quarter PV was about 5%, debit at 17%, credit at negative 6%, in the U.S. PV 8%, debit up 21%, credit down 3% and thus far up through to the 21st of January last time, we talked about this, same trends. So all of that the same thing [ph] is going to stay for a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We've also talked about what's driving debit, and a lot of it'll stay the acceleration of cash displacement, as people don't want to touch cash and the growth of cash to pay. The growth of purchasing online, a lot of it non-discretionary spend online, which is disproportionately debit. And again, you can't use cash online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In periods of economic uncertainty, another driver debit, periods of economic uncertainty, people tend to spend what they have, as opposed to borrowing. And so there's a shift from credit to debit, forget the pandemic for a second. In any downturn, we consistently see that. And of course, stimulus in particularly in the U.S. with unemployment and federal stimulus, a lot of that on prepaid cards, which we count on our debit numbers. So all that has happened. So we expect debit growth to continue strong through this year, for sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I do want to be clear; we think credit will come back. Credit always lags in difficult periods, as I mentioned. But this situation is particularly acute because discretionary affluent spend is way down because of the restrictions on affluent. So affluent discretionary spends often on restaurants, entertainment, travel all that's literally physically restricted. But we do think that as vaccine distribution as everything begins to recover, there'll be some pent-up demand, and we expect a good recovery to credit. And importantly, we expect a lot of that recovery in credit not to necessarily eat away and cannibalize that debit growth, we think a lot of it will be additive as people get out of the blocks and do the traveling that they want to do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So before I dig into a couple of things that you mentioned there, I should mention to those that are listening via the webcast, if you want to submit a question, you can do it via the webcast. And we'll come to that, in our -- during our conversation with Oliver. So, I guess the first thing I would ask at a high-level if you're expecting ongoing debit growth and then credit to come back, but particularly that debit portion. Does that outlook -- is that changing the view or how you and your partners view the structure of the partnerships, what kinds of partners that Visa should be looking for? Is there a different conversation that's happening with merchants and issuers et cetera? Just wondering, like how that particularly that's surprising pull-forward that we've seen in the last year plus the expectation of ongoing debit growth is changing, if at all, on your conversations you have with all the different stakeholders?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think the answer is yes and no, I'll start with the no. No, it's not really changing the conversations and a no argument is most of our partnerships with many of our partners are pretty long-term in nature. So there's a little bit of this too shall pass and therefore, we're doing a long-term agreement, payment credentials will always be changing in one way or another. We want to be partnering with the same types of players that we were partnering with before. And there's no major structural change that would say that we don't want to talk to this group of issuers or this group of acquirers, et cetera. So in many ways, it's business as usual in those interactions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes it has changed is this is a pretty seismic shock to how payments is taking place. And even though credit will cover, debit is still very strong, e-commerce will remain very strong, tap to pay is a big deal for retailers and merchants a lot more online, a lot more new business models that buy online pick up and store, a lot more omnichannel. So the specific tactics and partnership initiatives that we're working with players are different, but the people that we want to work with, the players that we want to work with, are the same, we're still pivoting and changing together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So talking about change and I think I'm hitting on another like, very hot topic right now is Buy Now Pay Later. We'll be hearing from a firm little bit later today. Some of the Buy Now Pay Later providers around have ambitions or have stated their ambitions to one-day process their transactions on ACH and move away from the card networks. What -- how is Visa looking at the Buy Now Pay Later phenomenon generally and from a global perspective? And how would you characterize Visa's relationships with the -- with these -- with the Buy Now Pay Later providers as they stand today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So I think Buy Now Pay Later is top of the list of topics right after Crypto and the things that we're often talking about in settings like this. But listen our strategy on Buy Now Pay Later is sort of twofold, partnering with the providers that are out there and offering our own solutions. Let me talk about both of those and the dynamics within each. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On partnering with the providers that are out there. We're early investors in Klarna and PAYD; we're working with players such as Afterpay and Affirm, ChargeAfter, Splitit et cetera. And there's a range of things that we do with these partners. You mentioned one of them, but I'll go through sort of four, five, six of them now. First of all is obviously repayment. And when someone's actually made that purchase, they need to pay the installment provider. And that's one payment divided into four, or five or six. And those are often on Visa credentials. Different providers rely on Visa credentials to differing extents. But we think it's a great value proposition for the consumer and the provider. And we think that'll be there for a while. But there'll always be dynamics there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another way, we work together is Virtual Cards. So an installment provider using a virtual credential to actually pay the merchant seamlessly and easily. Another one is a digital card. So this is an installment provider provisioning a digital card into consumers' wallet to complete a point-of-sale, physical point-of-sale installment transaction. You've got value-added services where we will provide risk or data services to an installment provider to help them be more efficient in their jobs. vDirect is ways to conduct merchant settlement or installment settlement payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There's also just debit or credit cards. So as an installment provider wants to broaden his relationship with his consumers, they'll want to offer debit or credit or prepaid cards for everyday spend. And all of those are products that we can work on together. So that is quite a long list of things that we can do to help round out and partner with those installment providers and there's a lot of really good conversations happening there as they push to get themselves to scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On our own offering, as we've been at working with all of these installment partners, we've realized a few pain points in the industry. One is there isn't one ubiquitous global solution; two, there's friction in the process, we actually have to sign-up and adjudicate the credit. And then, you've got large issuers with plenty of open to buy who wants to actually participate in this as well. So these are some friction pain points in the space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so with our Visa Installment Solutions, we're leveraging our existing connectivity with issuers, with merchants, with acquirers, with processors around the globe, to develop a solution that doesn't require customer signup that leverages existing open to buy as a really simple and easy way to have installments work. And so in this solution, an issuer ahead of time can decide which consumers, which cardholders they want to get, which installment packages too, so that when that consumer shows up at a physical point-of-sale, or online and uses their card at a participating merchant, they're immediately presented with that offer. And it can flow through the regular connectivity in the piece of pipes to deliver it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we're working on some select markets around the world, including here in North America and U.S. and Canada in particular. And we'll continue to push on it. So overall, we think there's a lot of upside in BNPL for us both through partnering with the providers that are doing it uniquely, as well as offering our own solution. We'll continue to push on both of those -- both of those paths.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when you look at and I think the partnership angle is interesting there's obviously a lot of things that Visa can do within the realm of its existing relationships, et cetera. But if we just look at a -- just a plain vanilla buy now pay later transaction today. How are you thinking about that for Visa? Is that incrementally positive? Or is incrementally negative or, because on the one hand, maybe the transaction goes outside? But then there's the repayment process? Like how, how are you thinking about a buy now pay later transaction as it stands today, outside of like your own offering and existing partners with partnerships with issuers, et cetera?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, it's a bit of a mix. I mean the first thing I'd say is different models will pop-up in payments around the world, all the time. And whether it's exactly what you want, or close to what you want, or something in between. Our job is to sort of roll with it, see what the consumers and merchants are demanding and make the most of what's materializing. So we spend a little less time thinking about whether we want it to exist and what it means for us one way or the other is more it is a reality. How do we adjust and add value to make it successful in a way that's successful for us as well. And what could we do with our existing partners to offer a solution?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it's certainly a bit of a mixed bag. I mean, for all of them, the things I mentioned on the partnership, those are good incremental services for us to provide. And certainly BNPL generally is getting a lift in terms of sales to that merchant presumably, or they wouldn't be doing it. And I think also, Visa is always a fan of the electronification and the efficiency of digital payments. And so if this drives more sales to digital electronic efficient payments versus sort of less efficient paper-based payments, that's a good thing. And we'll find a way to get our fair share of it. So it's a bit of a mixed bag, but overall we see lots of opportunity in it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, got it. I want to turn a little bit to other FinTechs and we've seen -- fighting office needs there. Sorry about that. So we've seen a lot of tech competitors, or players in the market like Venmo, PayPal, Google issuing decent debit cards and to basically take advantage of their own products, et cetera. How much of an impact are these types of new issuers having on debit right now? Is it moving the needle for Visa at all? Or is it something that you would anticipate coming further down the road, et cetera?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me work my way into that question and talk just about our philosophy of FinTechs more broadly, and then get to that specific sort of question on debit. But overall, when we think about FinTech, the ones that you mentioned are even smaller startups. Our view is Visa is a network. And as such, it's not our job to pick winners and losers. We provide a platform, and the platform invites everyone to come and play and may the best idea win. And consumers and merchants can decide what's the best used case and they can compete and the winner will win. And generally that serves us very well. And most of our clients be they, new FinTechs or traditional players, they understand that, it's not our job to be kingmaker. So again, similar to my comment on BNPL, a lots going to happen in payments and we just wanted to happen in our platform in one way or the other and make sure it's a level playing field for that competition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I made a couple more things on FinTech generally then I hit your point. When we look at FinTechs oftentimes, the things that FinTechs look for from us are similar to what larger traditional players are looking for, is brand, there's technology, there's access to our people and our expertise, our brand is incredibly powerful, and can drive great lift for any issuer. But for FinTechs, they like to be able to draft off our brand as they're investing in their own brand. They want the sort of security and Halo associated with Visa brand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe let's do with a Venmo or PayPal, some the folks that you mentioned have their own strong brands. But for a lot of the other startups that's quite helpful. A lot of FinTechs want to lean on our technology quite heavily, not just the core five nines off/clear/settle. But also the 600 APIs, the billion a month API calls that we received FinTechs want to be able to leverage that from us in a meaningful way. And again, they want access to our people and our capabilities as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now on your specific question on what that means for debit. I mean, I think it has been positive for us, I mean more people who are coming in and offering new dynamic digital ways to pay or be paid, and are electronifying what otherwise would be less efficient paper-based cash payments. That's all good for us. And it generates great customer experience, great engagements, great digital habituation, and that's all good. So we feel good about those folks coming into the space and mixing it up and offering new value propositions that are resonating with consumers and merchants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe just a quick question, tied back to your comment about an even playing field, et cetera. One of the things that we've seen is that some FinTechs have been able to take advantage of some of the differences that are out there in terms of debit interchange rates, et cetera between large and small banks, et cetera and one of the things that we've seen particularly for FinTechs is they look to drive that as a revenue source, we're starting to hear some of the bigger banks particularly like Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan, talking about how they thought that that type of loophole should be addressed. How do you -- how does Visa fit into that regulatory construct of making sure that there is an even playing field where it makes sense?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I don't really have any material comment to add outside of the media back and forth on it. It's not really something that directly impacts us. So it's not. I don't really have anything to add. But, you're right; there has been an instant conversation out of it. It's not -- it's not really our -- we don't have a horse in that race.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That's fine. So let's talk about incremental services, et cetera. Visa Direct is one that you guys have talked a lot about and has picked up a lot of interesting commentary over the last few years and a new Visa itself with really strong growth in Visa Direct. Can you go through briefly for us that the used cases for Visa Direct describe which of these used cases have gained the most traction, if you will? And tell us what you think the vision is for that longer-term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So when we think of Visa Direct is within the strategic pillar of new payment flows, and new payment flows is $185 trillion opportunity. There's two key engines within that Visa Direct, which is about $65 trillion, and B2B, which is $120 trillion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, let me talk about -- a bit about Visa Direct. It continues to grow incredibly well. We've got three -- three areas we're focused on for the growth of Visa Direct, continuing to grow existing used cases, taking existing identified used cases and spreading them around the world and coming up with new used cases. Those are the drivers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to rattle a few-off and I'll go into more detail. You've got P2P; you've got cross-border P2P remittances, you've got disbursements such as insurance disbursements, merchant settlement, early wage access, gig-economy payouts, account-to-account transfer and money movement. So there's a lot of used cases and more coming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of which ones are growing well. It depends on when you ask. My father has used to say horses for courses, which essentially means different horses do well on different tracks essentially. And if you would ask me which used cases in Visa Direct, are the killer apps, pre-pandemic? I mean, one of the biggest ones for us was Uber and Lyft Driver payouts so they could receive their money right at the end of their shift. Well, that\u2019s clearly dried up a fair bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it's been replaced with a nice hedge with early wage access, or cross-border remittance pushing money to my family back in Canada or what have you. So it's really been a nice mix and a nice hedge of different business cases. But again, P2P was the first used case, it's still going strong around the world, cross-border P2P remittances is doing extremely well we're partnering with MoneyGram, Western Union, Remitly and TransferWise and others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Insurance disbursements, I think it's seven of the top 10 PNC insurers are in some capacity using Visa Direct to push out disbursements in emergency situations rather than waiting for a check, when you need the money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earn wage access, and payroll is very powerful for us and are happy with the progress we're making there. Merchant settlement in marketplaces like Etsy, for example I'm just making them up. I'm not announcing a partnership or anything but Etsy pushing money out to sellers around the world for goods that they're selling on their platform. All of these are great used cases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it's also another example where we've got our network-of-network strategy, because in FY 2020 to do our settlement, perhaps maybe my numbers here, to move that money, we touched on 16 card based networks, 65 domestic ACA schemes, seven RTP schemes and five payment gateways to be able to move that money from one endpoint to another, we've got a great advantage for all the cards that we've got out there. But we can also leverage other platforms to move. So we feel great about it. And we think it's a very, very versatile tool for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And I've been mixing in questions that have come in from the audience, as we've gone along. But to wrap-up the last topic here B2B, obviously, very big incorporate some of the investor questions here. But big investment area for Visa, how can we track your progress with the -- within B2B? I guess generally and can you talk about B2B Connect and other solutions? And what stages of development are we what's happening from a revenue margin countries and how we -- how should we be thinking about the development and beginnings of contribution from B2B?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So just as a reminder, $120 trillion, 20 trillion cardable, like GDP card, virtual card, 10 million -- 10 trillion cross-border, 90 trillion domestic APAR. If you go through each of those quickly like the cardable 20 trillion, this is ground that we've been wrestling in for a while. And so I think our success there is going to be watching wins. I think a key thing for us, key to focus on for us is in the virtual space. That's where we're spending a lot of our time and focus on issuer engagement, new vertical expansion with OTA, Health, Education, et cetera and working through just efficiency and getting that really proliferating in the market. So in cardable, so lot going on, lots of deals in the space virtual scheme [ph].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">B2B Connect, you asked about, listen B2B Connect, we feel great about, it takes a while to get this built out and running, you would have seen our announcement on Goldman Sachs, recently leveraging B2B Connect, it joins a range of other banks. Our pipeline is very, very strong here. We feel great about this. But again, it takes a bit of time to do the work to sort of make the sales to get the integration. But we're solving a big significant problem, the current model with correspondent banks and handoffs and poor data quality, and limited transparency, uncertainty on timing and it's quite expensive. We think this is an investment that is going to pay-off significantly. And like I said, I won't share the details, but the pipeline is really, really rich, we feel great about it; we can operate in 80 countries today. But another I think 30 in the next 18 months or so. So B2B Connect, we feel wonderful about little bit more time to sort of build out and get the implementation space, but we feel wonderful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then 90 trillion APAR, someone is going to crack this. The invoice, PO paper based reconciliation headache that happens in domestic APAR someone is going to solve this. We can't solve it by ourselves; we need big assets and capabilities of other people to join us. But we're going to partner to get good success here. We talked about PayMate in India, which is 35,000, suppliers and buyers working together. What we've got with Billtrust and Business Payment Network in the U.S. is going very well for us. So this is also going to be sort of medium-term horizon to really build this out. But our commitment to B2B is long-term; we will absolutely have great success in this space. But it's a bit more infrastructure and time and work to get this built out. But we feel great about the progress we're making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Faucette</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oliver, thank you very much for joining us here at the Morgan Stanley's TMT Conference. Last question as we wrap-up what big takeaways do we have from the whiteboard behind you as it relates to Visa, what if we have to certify what should we learn here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Oliver Jenkyn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, there is two important things. My daughter did me a picture which said be nice. So takeaway is to be nice. And the rest of it is like high school algebra and chemistry. It's where my daughter does her homework in the evening. So it's of no use to you as investors, I'm afraid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>James Faucette</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right.
