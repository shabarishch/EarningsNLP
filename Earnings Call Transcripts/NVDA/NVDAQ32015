Third quarter results were strong, with record revenue and improved performance in each of our businesses. Our focus on creating platforms for PC, mobile and datacenter is paying off. Our PC gaming platform benefited from the enthusiastic reception of our new flagship GeForce GTX gaming processors based on Maxwell. Our 10th generation GPU architecture, Maxwell sets new standards for performance and power efficiency, introducing a range of new features for gamers and game developers. Real time dynamic global illumination is a lead forward in replicating the true interaction of light in the gaming environment. Other new technologies render games at higher frame rates with very low power, heat and noise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Both the desktop versions of these processors, the GTX 980 and the GTX 970 and their notebook counterparts have won extraordinary support from reviewers. Forbes wrote of our new GPUs: They are higher performing and more power efficient than the previous generation and design win abound. That\u2019s pretty much a trifecta in the mobile market. Commenting the desktop versions, Hardware Canucks called the GTX 980 a market changing graphic card that is back stopped by an impressive GPU architecture. We launched Maxwell in a groundbreaking event for the gaming community called Game 24. This live stream 24 hour celebration included gaming tournaments, modding competitions and celebrity commentators. As it moved across the globe, all along the way we drew more than 1.3 million Twitch viewers in 120 countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the mobile platform space, the SHIELD tablet, the latest extension of our SHIELD family of devices enjoyed solid demand during the quarter. The ultimate tablet made for gamers, it features the extreme performance of Tegra K1 mobile processor and the precision control of the SHIELD wireless controller. SHIELD tablet sales have extended into many worldwide markets and the 32 gigabyte LTE model has been recently added to the lineup. Very soon SHILED tablet will be upgraded to Google\u2019s latest OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tegra K1 was also featured in the Google Nexus 9 tablet launched last month in a 64 bit version. Powered by our project Denver CPU, Tegra K1 is the first ARM processor for Android to take advantage of the Android 5.0 support for 64 bit architectures. Tegra K1 is also now in Chromebooks from Acer and HP. Tegra technology continues to make strong headway in the automotive segment as well. Last month Paris Auto show, Honda announced that three of its popular models will come standard in the European market with a Tegra based infotainment and navigation system. This marks the first in-vehicle infotainment system to use the Android operating system running on Tegra.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tegra will enable Honda Connect to deliver a touchscreen experience like the intuitive experience you'd experience from a phone or tablet with crisp graphics that respond instantly to gestures like pinch, zoom, and swipe, but is designed for safe operation in a car. Honda now joins Volkswagen in our stable, but mainstream auto brands relying on Tegra, complimenting luxury brands like Audi, BMW, Lamborghini and Tesla Motors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our enterprise businesses also had a strong quarter, benefiting from new products and industry trends that fuel demand for them. Our Quadro professional solutions, including processors based on the new Maxwell GPU architecture are enjoying the fast ramp up of any Quadro product in our history. They are being shipped by all of our major OEMs and adopted by global enterprise companies. This new line up provides up to two times improvement in application performance and data handling capability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the datacenter platform space, NVIDIA GRID graphics virtualization continues to gain momentum. Thousands of companies have come forward worldwide to experience cloud based GPU accelerated virtual desktops through our tri-grid online demonstration. Also a program we launched in August with VMware for early customer access to GRID virtualized GPUs is drawing wide global interest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Initial customers include aircraft maker Airbus, the international construction group CH2M Hill, and healthcare provider MetroHealth. Other early notable GRID customers include Villanova University and Halliburton. Our Tesla accelerated datacenter platform continues to grow as HPC customers and cloud service providers deploy large Tesla powered systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fueling Tesla growth is the rapid rise of machine learning, particularly among mobile web service companies like China Baidu [ph] that are standardizing on Tesla as their common platform. As noted in the story, in the current issue of Wired GPUs are exceptionally well suited for parallel processing tasks, like speech recognition, image, and natural language processing. IBM unveiled its first open power based system featuring Tesla GPU accelerators which can significantly enhance Java, Big Data and technical computing applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">IBM announced plans to accelerate their enterprise applications using Tesla GPUs, including their nearly pervasive IBM DV2 with blue database software. We are excited about this month's Supercomputing 2014 conference New Orleans, where we will be demonstrating the latest breakthrough in supercomputing and visualization based on our Tesla accelerated computing platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at the financials. Revenue growth year-over-year was driven by strength of GeForce GPUs for gaming related to our launch in Q3 of Maxwell GTX GPUs as well as the strength in datacenter GPUs and Auto Infotainment Systems. GPU business revenue grew 13% from a year earlier. Revenue from GeForce GPUs for gaming desktops and notebooks grew 36%, fueled by continued strength PC gaming, including Maxwell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Within this segment, gaming notebooks performed particularly well, more than doubling from year-ago levels. Tesla for high performance computing increased strongly, representing another record quarter of revenue driven by large project wins with cloud service providers and government customers. Quadro revenue remained strong, with our new product platform launched in August, delivering industry leading graphics and rendering performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tegra processor sales grew 51% from a year-ago, led by auto infotainment systems, mobile devices, embedded systems and the onset of the SHIELD tablet sales. Auto Infotainment systems revenue nearly doubled year-over-year. Revenue was up 11% from the second quarter of fiscal 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to gross margins. GAAP gross margins was 55.2%, in-line with our outlook for the quarter, down 90 basis points from last quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 55.5%, also in-line with our outlook and down 90 basis points sequentially. The gross margin reflected continued strength in our GPU margins for PC platforms, inclusive of the product transition to Maxwell based GPUs for the desktop, notebook and workstation. Our margins from the above mentioned PC platforms and datacenter and cloud GPUs were partially offset by the impact of Tegra processor margins, which are lower than the Company\u2019s overall average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $463 million, in line with our outlook and up 2% from Q2. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $415 million, lower than our outlook and inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. The operating expense discipline reflects continued management of our investment in both R&amp;D and capital expenditures to enhance our return on invested capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP operating income was $213 million up 51% from the prior year\u2019s third quarter, reflecting strong revenue growth from higher margin GPUs and contained operating expenses. GAAP net income was $173 million, up 45% from a year earlier driven by increased operating profit from strong revenue and margins. GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.31 increased 55% from $0.20 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting net income growth and share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to some key balance sheet items. During the third quarter we paid $46 million in cash dividends and repurchased 16.8 million shares under a structured repurchase agreement entered into during the quarter. During the first three first quarters of fiscal year \u201915, we paid a $140 million in cash dividends and repurchased 44.2 million shares. As a result we have returned to shareholders $950 million during the first three quarters of fiscal year \u201915.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Since the restart of our capital return program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we have returned approximately 2.17 billion. This return represents 136% of our cumulative free cash flow for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 to date and reflects the acceleration of our capital return program from cash generated in prior years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we transition into fiscal year \u201916 as part of our ongoing commitment to deliver shareholder value through capital return, we are pleased to announce our intention to return approximately $600 million to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases in fiscal year 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Accounts receivable at the end of Q3 were $563 million up from $470 million in Q2. The sequential increase was primarily due to the mid-quarter launch of our Maxwell based GPUs and the late quarter project shipments in our database business, compared with last quarter. DSO at quarter end was 42 days, up from 39 days in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventory at the end of Q3 was $408 million, up from $387 million in the prior quarter. The sequential increase included the ramping of Maxwell based GPUs coupled with decreases in products based on previous-generation architectures. DSI at quarter-end was 68 days, down from 73 days at the end of Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cash flow from operating activities was $216 million, up from $96 million in the prior quarter and from $162 million a year earlier. Our operating cash flow grew 33% year-over-year reflecting higher net income from revenue growth and contained operating expenses, partially offset by higher accounts receivable. Free cash flow was $176 million in the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense amounted to $55 million, capital expenditures were $40 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We expect revenue for the fourth quarter to be $1.2 billion, plus or minus 2%. The year-over-year growth is reflective of our continued strength in gaming for the PC, the notebook and mobile platforms. Additionally, we expect growth from our enterprise platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 55.2% and 55.5% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. The gross margin outlook is in line with our gross margin results in Q3, as high end GTX GPUs and datacenter results will contribute to the strong gross margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $470 million and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $422 million, inclusive of legal fees associated with our litigation against Samsung and Qualcomm. Excluding these legal fees, we expect operating expenses to remain near Q3 levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 are both expected to be 18%, plus or minus 1%. This estimate is a percentage point lower than our previous outlook and is consistent with our tax rate in the third quarter, excluding any discrete tax events.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are pleased with our record revenue for both the quarter and year-to-date with strength across all platforms and businesses. Profitability, as measured by earnings per diluted share, increased 55% for the first nine months of fiscal 2015 compared with the prior year. Our 10th generation GPU Maxwell displayed a strong showing with stellar reviews and an innovative launch. We continue to embark on large engagements in datacenter and cloud with outstanding partners, IBM, HP, Dell, Citrix and VMware. Auto continues to gain ground with continued wins, including Honda this quarter. Tegra K1, through SHIELD and Nexus 9 continues to be praised for its technology achievement and expansion of Android gaming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue our transformation into a business focused on visual computing platforms, allowing us to realize continued success in consumer PC and mobile gaming as well as in cloud datacenters, supercomputers, professional design and automobiles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take questions. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Stephen Chin with UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Stephen Chin - UBS Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question I have is just to go deeper on some of the PC gaming trends [indiscernible]. Could you talk a little bit about how much strength you saw from a seasonal perspective for PC gaming and how much of it might have been from the new Maxwell product launch?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Stephen. First of all, you know that the gaming business is expanding globally. And we\u2019re seeing great strength in Asia. We\u2019re seeing great strength in developing countries. We\u2019re seeing incredible enthusiasm around MOBA, which is an online battle arena gameplay style. It\u2019s crossing over from being just video games to now being e-sports. And so the cultural implication of video games is getting greater and greater.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are several factors that drives our gaming business. One is whenever we see a really exciting new game come to market, games like Assassins Creed or Batman or some of the amazing Ubisoft games that we\u2019ve been seeing, Battlefield, Call of Duty, these incredible franchises that has millions of followers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the second factor is whenever we introduce a new GPU architecture that is a huge leap from previous generations. Right now one of the most exciting things going on is driving beyond 1080p. 4k monitors are getting more and more cost effective. And without something like Maxwell, it's really hard to enjoy the full fidelity of a 4k display.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so these things all contribute. But I think at the highest level, gaming is just expanding globally. And now with Maxwell and a brand new architecture that gives us a huge leap from previous generation, we\u2019re going to draw people out to upgrade to Maxwell so that they can take their gaming experience to the next level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now for the near term, Q3 of course we benefited tremendously from the Maxwell launch. Overall for the year, PC gaming for us was up over 30%. And so that gives you a sense of how PC gaming is expanding. Going into Q4, you\u2019re going to see some pretty amazing franchise titles coming out. It's the holiday season. And so we\u2019re looking forward to quite a good year in PC gaming. But overall PC gaming is expanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Stephen Chin - UBS Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And for my follow up, just to touch upon the GRID business, so you mentioned the early customer access program for GRID with VMware. Any thoughts on the timing for how long that qualification cycle might take? And what kind of I guess brand profile we might expect going into next year for GRID and Tegra as a whole? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, our datacenter business overall had a record quarter. And we\u2019re seeing expansion in our datacenter business in multiple ways. And I appreciate you recognizing GRID. We entered into a partnership with VMware to support early adaptors of vSphere, which is supporting our GRID Virtual GPU technology. With this VMware and GRID platform, NVIDIA GRID platform, you can now virtualize all of enterprise, all the way out to the clients, and you can make it possible for the most graphics intensive applications. Whether new or legacy PC applications, you can now virtualized it, stream the graphics to any heterogeneous device that your company decides to support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re seeing enthusiasm all over the world. In fact, since we announced this collaboration with them to develop the market together, we\u2019ve seen thousands of companies try GRID. It\u2019s easy to try. You might want to try it yourself. Just type in try GRID on the web and it will take you to a Web site and will download a small client and you can enjoy with the GRID experience and see what it\u2019s like. We have thousands of interested companies. We\u2019ve selected many around the world. Many of them are very large enterprises, who have several different needs. Some companies because their campus is quite large, and so it\u2019s hard for IT departments to support all of the various workstations and PCs that are scattered all over campus. Universities are the same way. Sometimes it\u2019s because the workforce has large fluctuations. Maybe they use a lot of contractors, maybe it\u2019s because students graduate every year. And so there's a lot of different reasons why virtualizing the enterprise desktop is incredibly valuable to these companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As usual, enterprise validation and certification take some time. And so I don\u2019t know -- I can\u2019t give you a particular schedule, but I can tell you that the trials are going really well. And now because of VMware, we can now engage 90% of the world\u2019s virtualization opportunities and the size of opportunities that we\u2019re now looking at is getting larger and larger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Colette Kress</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Following up on the gaming question; the more than doubling in notebook gaming. Can you give us some context around that? That seems like a big growth rate. Is that a global phenomenon or is that kind of more regional and what do you think is driving that strength?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot Joe. For the very first time in history we\u2019ve been able to get a GPU architecture that is able to do in a notebook form factor, achieve a level of performance that is on parity, on par with desktop PCs. This is a really-really big deal. In a thin notebook, Maxwell GPU, because it\u2019s two times the performance power factor compared to Kepler, which is already the most energy efficient GPU we\u2019ve ever built and the most energy efficient GPU in the world today, we lapped by a factor of two. And as a result we\u2019re able to bring to the notebook form factors, a level of performance that\u2019s on par with desktop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now gamers don\u2019t have to choose. It\u2019s really just the matter of what kind of platform you\u2019re enjoying. And we know that a lot of people like laptops. So it's just that for gamers, until now, they\u2019ve not been able to gain access to that level of performance without Maxwell. So this is a big deal for us and we\u2019re quite excited about the Maxwell ramp and it's just beginning to ramp. My expectation is that we\u2019re going to continue to grow the notebook gaming business for some time here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then also on the client GPU business, can you talk a little bit about pricing? And it seems like your competitor hasn\u2019t had the success you guys have had and it sounds like it\u2019s being relatively price aggressive. They\u2019ve talked about that. Can you just talk about the pricing environment and does that competitive dynamic affect you guys at all?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it\u2019s really related to value I think. Our strategy with GeForce has really moved away from a component pricing model for several years. And it\u2019s the reason why the value that is received by our gamers and appreciated by gamers continues to grow. We\u2019ve really taken much more of a software rich approach. Even though our GPU architecture is now far and away the best in the world, it\u2019s the most energy efficient, it's the highest performance. It has amazing technology like VXGI that was just announced recently. Although at the foundational technology, it is far and away the best, if you look at the software environment, what we call the GFE, the GeForce experience console that\u2019s on top, we really think about the GeForce as a GeForce gaming PC platform now. The software intensity of it is quite high. If you have GeForce Experience, your ability to enjoy games at it fullest is really incomparable. And so I think that people don\u2019t choose component A to component B anymore. Overtime we see a lot more return customers and once you get on the GeForce platform, you tend to stay on the GeForce platform. And our goal is just keep adding more and more value to the GeForce gamers that are to join the GeForce platform to earn their loyalty over time, and I think we're doing really good job there. I'm really proud of the team for their work here. And the results kind of show it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. I have a question regarding the attach rates in traditional PC market. Do you see the declining attach rates in traditional PC to become a drag at some point? And if so, what kind of impact do you expect to see?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">PC OEMs represent about less than 25% of our GPU business and much less than 25% of our overall business already. And within that there are some moving parts. PCs are becoming thinner and lighter, in some cases and as result they tend to not have GPUs attached. In some cases the PCs are becoming application specific PCs, like gaming notebooks, in which case the GPU not only is attached but the GPU becomes quite powerful indeed. On the other hand, workstation notebooks are growing. And so there's a lot of different moving parts, but I would say the mainstream commodity notebook PC, we have been seeing lower and lower GPU attach for quite a long time and it\u2019s not a surprise to us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. On the datacenter cloud market, the recent market adoption of HPC as a core processor with Intel Xeon processors, do you see that as a stumbling block towards growing your datacenter and cloud revenue?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well FPGAs have been around for 30 years and they've been used all kinds of applications, far and wide in all kinds of areas. GPU accelerated datacenters is really quite a new phenomenon. And the benefit of a GPU accelerated datacenter is that the amount of total computational resource you could bring to bear is really quite amazing. It\u2019s not really practical, not really logical that one person or small team designing an FPGA could achieve the level of computational throughput that the NVIDIA R&amp;D department with thousands and thousands of engineers, refining a singular architecture called CUDA over the years [indiscernible]. So it\u2019s not logical that that could happen. And then secondarily in CUDA, programming our GPUs is far, far, far easier than programming an FPGA. The R&amp;D cost is a lot lower. The rate or iteration is much higher. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why Tesla has yet another record quarter. The number of platforms that support Tesla is growing all over the world and I think it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that accelerated computing could add a lot of value in many areas of computing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Harlan Sur - JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking into your revenue guidance for Q4, can you just tell us if your GeForce PC gaming segment is growing quarter-over-quarter and maybe that\u2019s potentially being offset by your PC OEM business? Jen-Hsun, as you mentioned, we just had the big launch of Call of Duty Advanced Warfare. We've got the Assassin's Creed launch coming up soon. We've got several other blockbuster games in November. So I would assume that your PC gaming is up sequentially in January, but wanted to get your thoughts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Harlan I appreciate that. We're expecting our gaming platforms and our enterprise datacenter platforms to be up quarter-to-quarter. Those are benefitting from both industry adoption of our platforms, as well as the fact that we are going into a brand new product cycle with Maxwell. We're also expecting our OEM business to be down sequentially, but our guidance reflects all that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Harlan Sur - JPMorgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then as you mentioned continued strength in enterprise, we\u2019ve got the [indiscernible] microprocessor ramp going into datacenters and HPCs. It was about 10% of the mix for Intel in Q3. One of the first big adopters, like I said does tend to be HPC and datacenter. So the question is how much of this is contributing to the strength in Tesla and potentially your GRID based products or is it more just sort of with Tesla and GRID, just prior design wins that are finally starting to ramp or maybe a combination of both?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well Tesla and GRID are both delivering record numbers at the moment, and they're driven by the fact that the enterprise adoption of our platforms are increasing. But in the grand scheme of things, they are still a small percentage of the world\u2019s overall servers. And so my sense is that those matters are important but they\u2019re not significant. Most of our adoptions tend to be related to new applications or an OEM certifying a new server for GRID, and there's a whole bunch of servers being certified right now, or a cloud datacenter service -- a service provider who is able to deploy their service using machine learning service or a natural language processing service or a music tagging service or some service that requires our GPUs deployed into production. And so those tend to the large reasons why we grow, more so than the microprocessor that it's attached to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with you question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Chris Hemmelgarn on Blayne. Congrats on a good quarter. First, I was curious, with Intel\u2019s new Broadwell platform looking to launch late first half -- some point in the first half of Q -- of next year, are you guys, I guess concerned about any more pronounced seasonality in Q1 ahead of that product launch or would you expect kind of just general typical seasonal trends this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our OEM business is just a smaller and smaller part of our overall business driver. Most of the platforms that we offer engage specific vertical markets, whether it\u2019s gaming or high performance computing or enterprise virtualization or the cloud services with service providers who are the automotive industry. And so these verticals tend to be much more important in how we think about our business. We also see now that our OEMs or our OEM partners go into a new product cycle when we launch a new product. And so when there's a new Maxwell GPU recently, every notebook OEM in the world offered a brand new gaming notebook, irrespective of the rest of the platform and the reception of those notebooks have been fantastic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s been so successful for us in the notebook gaming business, that for the very first time HP and Lenovo, both joined our GeForce gaming platform and offered gaming notebooks under their own brands. And so we\u2019re excited about the work that we\u2019re doing here. We\u2019re seeing more and more this type of dynamic as we continue to transition our Company\u2019s business model from components business attached to other components to a platform model, where we engage vertical markets where we serve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess follow-up, just turning to automotive business, obviously going quite well for you. You\u2019ve highlighted strength in infotainment this past quarter. It sounds like in December the new Tesla launching is going to support some type of autonomous driving. You guys had mentioned that at your last Analyst Day, I believe that that was one big opportunity for Tegra. I was just curious as to where you thought we were hitting a point where that could be a meaningful driver? You talked about the auto business doubling in consecutive years. Do you see some of these new opportunities \u2013 I guess a continued path for growth beyond that? Just kind of interested in your general thoughts?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we came into automotive industry because we think that the car is going to contain some of the powerful computers that we have and the future of the car is going to have computing in and not just infotainment, but the entire digital cockpit will be drive by computers and because of better and better auto-piloted capabilities, the car will become quite rich in supercomputing capabilities over time. And so this -- just in general, the car industry is quite a rich opportunity for our computing focus. Whether it's seeing around the car using visual computing technologies, or presenting information to the driver in all kinds of rich ways, whether it\u2019s Infotainment or your digital cockpit or heads up display or other technologies in the future, visual computing is going to play a huge role in the future of cars. So we\u2019re quite excited about the opportunities there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham &amp; Company. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rajvindra Gill - Needham &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Congratulations on very good results. Question on the GRID traction. In the past you talked about some design engagements and some metrics around that. I was wondering if you could perhaps update us a little bit on the trajectory of GRID in the enterprise as they begin to realize the leverage of cloud based visual computing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well we continue to track it. We\u2019re over a 1,000 trials around the world. And we\u2019re going to focus our energy, because we now have OEM partners and virtualization platform partners like VMware and Citrix who all have sales forces that are out there selling the platform now. We\u2019re going to focus our energy to continue to evangelize GRID and to help the top customers, the top and the large engagements adopt GRID in trial and doing their trial performance of GRID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we\u2019re going to continue to track them and the number of opportunities continue to grow. I just mentioned earlier, as we partnered with VMware to take vSphere around the world, the number of customers who have come out to ask to be early adopters and to be part of the trial program is really quite exciting. And we put a web self-trial service up on the cloud called Try GRID and I encourage you all to try it. Thousands and thousands of companies have come out to try it. And so I think it stands to reason that enterprises around the world would like to virtualize their entire enterprise. It\u2019s more secure. It\u2019s more cost effective. It allows for a mobile work force, and in many industries quite a dynamic work force. The work force could ramp up and down pretty dramatically from season to season and because they work with a lot of contractors, they could be onsite and off and change quite rapidly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so GRID virtualizes all of their workstations and PCs and makes it a lot easier for enterprises to support their dynamic work force. And so there's a lot of different reasons why GRID is just a really fantastic extension of the entire enterprise virtualization movement. And so it\u2019s the reason why all of these OEMs are supportive of GRID and why they\u2019re taking it to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rajvindra Gill - Needham &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And my follow up question, on the fourth quarter revenue guidance, you had mentioned that the gaming platforms would be up sequentially and enterprise datacenter would be up sequentially. So that would imply that the Tegra business is down sequentially, in order to hit the numbers for the midpoint of the guidance. Just wondering is that's just normal seasonality that you\u2019re seeing in Tegra for Q4 or if there's any other issues that are going on there? If you could elaborate on Tegra going into Q4, that would be helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, our strategy is to continue to advance our own platforms that are addressing these local markets. And when I said the gaming platform was going to be up sequentially, I meant that our PC desktop, our PC notebook and our SHIELD gaming platforms would all be up sequentially. They would each all be up sequentially. Our OEM business will be down sequentially and part of it is PC OEMs and part of it is device OEMs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Colette Kress</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, do we have another question? Operator, can you hear us? We can\u2019t hear you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry about that. Technical difficulty. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Guana with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Alex Guana - JMP Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jen-Hsun, I know earlier that you addressed the issue of Broadwell being a little slower to market. But I'm kind of curious from a process technology perspective. Does the trouble that Intel is having with 14 nanometer mean anything to you as you work to bring FinFET technology to market? Does it make you nervous about your own timelines or does it make you more excited that you\u2019re going to be in a position to maybe compete with a like for like transistor technology in the 2015 timeframe?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, first of all, we have a lot of different levers. I\u2019ve been asked in the past about Moore's Law and I believe in Moore's Law. But Moore's Law is not just about physics. Moore's Law is also about architecture and innovation. And it\u2019s really in the final analysis about performance and it's really into final analysis about clever ideas. And if you take a look at Maxwell, Maxwell improved on Kepler by a factor of two times on the performance power factor. That\u2019s really quite substantial and arguably unheard of. That\u2019s incredibly -- that\u2019s much faster than Moore's Law.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I believe in continued improvement in that area and that we have continue to add value through architecture, through design, through process and the combination of all that through software. All of those are levers for us. We\u2019re excited about the next generation of FinFET. The way that we deal with that that, you know that we've had quite a few scars in the past as we ramped up new process technology and we\u2019ve been better and better and better at it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the reason why is because we have just an extraordinary team in advanced technology group working deeply with our foundry partners and ensuring through real creation of test chips and rigorous test methodologies and development methodologies that ensure that when we are ready to ramp that the processors are ready for us. And I can tell you that for the next couple of nodes, I feel pretty good about it because of that work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Alex Guana - JMP Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And you touched on what I also wanted to talk about Maxwell in the market right now. I'm wondering, can you give me an example or us an example I should say of some of the gaming titles or the evolution of the industry that\u2019s starting to take advantage of Maxwell\u2019s capabilities right now? And I'm wondering if the clear advantage Maxwell has in the market is leading into any progress on the licensing front? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Every gamer who buys Maxwell will immediately benefit from Maxwell, in literally every single game they play. And they will enjoy in one of three ways. If you are a desktop gamer and you\u2019re playing one of the most advanced games out there, you\u2019re going to benefit. And it\u2019s likely that you have a GTX 560 or GTX 660 or GTX 760 or GTX 670. There are 10 million gamers who have GPUs that are GeForce\u2019s that are installed in their systems that can benefit from a Maxwell upgrade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when they install Maxwell, they\u2019re going to get the benefit of that 2x. They\u2019re going to either get better visual quality at the same frame rate or much higher frame rate at an even better and bigger quality. And so there's a lot of different ways they can enjoy that. If you are a notebook gamer, Maxwell allows you to enjoy desktop level of performance for the very first time in your laptop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then even if you had a game, and this is what\u2019s really cool about Maxwell. Even if you have a game that already is running at 60 frames per second on your 1080p monitor, the thing that\u2019s really cool about Maxwell is that we can now render to effectively a 4k resolution on our chip and we\u2019ll display it at 1080p on your monitor. And so all of a sudden your 1080p monitor improves in fidelity, as if you had a 4k monitor. So there's a lot of different ways that you can enjoy it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our licensing discussions are very active. And we have many in important stages. And I think at the highest level, the way to think about why we add value to several players in the industry is that the mobile device market is really commoditizing. And by adding NVIDIA GPU to their SoC, they can differentiate head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. And although there's a lot of different ways to differentiate, having the best processor in your mobile device is arguably the first way and arguably the best way of doing it. And so I think Maxwell surely adds value in that process. Tegra K1 adds an enormous amount of value in helping to validate the importance of our GPU and mobile applications. And so all of that helps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Colette Kress</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, next question? Operator, we\u2019re having a challenge hearing you. Can we get the next question?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry about that. Technical difficulties. Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Congratulations guys. Couple of questions there. On process node migrations, also to Alex question, what\u2019s the roadmap on the GPU side of the equation? Are you going to skip 20 nanometer and go straight to FinFET?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hans, we haven\u2019t announced our next generation products yet. And so we've got lot of great surprises for you guys and I'm excited about our next generation GPU. But right now we're enjoying ramping Maxwell. This is a brand new product cycle, and I don\u2019t remember our product cycle in our Company\u2019s history where we've had the lead that we have, the richness of applications in the gaming industry that we're ramping into, nor the number of vertical markets that we now serve, from gaming to design to cloud to high-performance computing, that we now serve that we're ramping this architecture into. And so Maxwell is unquestionably at this point a home run and we're just savoring the moment and ramping the living daylights out of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up Jen-Hsun. The game console guys have had a good year of a new product cycle to them. How do you compare this cycle for them versus PC gaming and Android gaming for that matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that the early adaptors of the game console market will enjoy every single platform. I've got everyone. And they'll have the PC, they'll have game consoles. But my sense is that the game console platform is not likely to enjoy the hay days when it was really unambiguously the only and the best game platform to enjoy games. It's just not true anymore. There are just too many other ways to enjoy games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The PC has become the world\u2019s largest game platform. China, the developing countries around the world, PC is a piece of platform they already own. They can upgrade it two, three, four times without having to change the basic platform. So the total of cost of ownership of a game PC is quite attractive. And the games are incredible. And so PC has become unambiguously the largest platform in the world today. Tencent is the largest game company. You could see how they're doing. And then of course, mobile. How can we ignore the largest operating system in the world, Android and why it won\u2019t become a premier game platform is beyond imagination really. And so I think that there's too many other ways to enjoy games now, for the game console to enjoy the hay days of the past. But we'll see. The thing that I do know is this, without any question is that the PC is continuing to expand the number of titles. Great titles are coming to the PC. It's is continuing to grow and the quality of titles is growing up ever so fast. And then mobile gaming is going to be right around the corner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from the line of Sanjay Chaurasia [ph]. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jen-Hsun, one question on Tesla. Some of your peers who are participating in the HPC market, they are highlighting some increased visibility. I was just wondering if you could give us any color on your visibility into Tesla. It has proven to be a little bit lumpy in the past. I was just wondering what kind of visibility you are seeing in this environment today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the number of applications that run on Tesla is growing and that is not a lumpy factor and it\u2019s continuing to grow. The number of customers of Tesla is growing. The number of industries that Tesla is servicing is growing. I think what really is happening is that it is now conventional wisdom that the accelerated computing model that we invented with Tesla is going to be a very important model for computing for as long as we see now. And when we go to Supercomputing this year and I hope that all of you keep an eye on it; I think Supercomputing is going to help us understand where accelerated computing fits in the psychology of computing around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it really is at the tipping point if not past, that accelerated computing can play a very important role in the whole field of computing. There's some applications where accelerating computing just utterly, utterly shines. Of course imaging is an area that accelerated computing does incredibly well. The number of applications related to understanding images and processing images, from satellites, from cameras all over the world, from smartphones from all over the world, understanding images is going to be just, if not the killer app, one of the major killer apps that we're looking at. This is a global phenomenon with all kinds of interesting applications. So high performance computing, accelerated computing at this point is really quite synonymous and I think that all the visibility that you see is just confirmation that we are down the right path.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Unidentified Analyst </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you earlier said that obviously Tesla is a very small percentage of overall compute in datacenter. In that sense what is the kind of growth profile you have in your mind? How do you see this business growing over the next two to three years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jen-Hsun Huang</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think that someday all datacenters will be accelerated and because we\u2019re starting from a very small base, it explains why Tesla is one of our largest growth opportunities. And for two consecutive quarters, we\u2019ve now seen record quarters and the number of partners that are supporting Tesla is growing and the depth of which they support Tesla is increasing. And so I think Tesla is going to be a large business over time and I would be very surprised if there are important or large datacenters anywhere in the world that aren\u2019t somehow accelerated by GPUs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our speakers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Colette Kress</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, operator.
