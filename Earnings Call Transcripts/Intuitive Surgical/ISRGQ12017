This first quarter of 2017 was a dynamic one for Intuitive, with strong performance in procedures and solid growth in system placements. We are making good progress in developing deeper connections to our customers worldwide and advancing technologies and offerings that fundamentally improve surgery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Procedure growth accelerated in the quarter rounding up to 18% over the first quarter of 2016. The growth was broad-based by procedure category, as well as global region. Starting with the United States, procedure growth in both the emerging category of general surgery and more mature categories in neurology and gynecology exceeded our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">General surgery growth continues to be encouraging with order of early clinical reports, surgeon interest, and utilization. Procedure growth in Europe, Korea, and China were strong in the quarter. While reasons for quarter-to-quarter fluctuations can be hard to assess, we estimate that Q1 benefited from some tailwinds that will balance out through the remainder of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call. Our capital placement performance in Q1 2017 strengthened over Q1 of 2016, resulting in a growth in total placements from a 110 to 133 this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we mentioned on these calls, capital placements can be lumpy, and after a strong 2016, U.S. capital placement settled into moderate growth relative to Q1 of last year. Outside the U.S. placement growth in the quarter was a highlight with 56 systems sold in the quarter versus 36 in Q1 of 2016. The lack of a new system quota in China and limited reimbursements in Japan constrained placement growth in these regions, Marshall will take you through system placement dynamics in greater detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to profitability for the quarter, strong procedure growth and solid system placements combined with favorable product mix and improvements in product cost to lead to gross margins at the top of our expected range and solid operating margin performance. Our fixed cost growth was as expected, with significant increases in R&amp;D spending that reflect investments and bringing new products through clinical trials on the path to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A summary of our first quarter pro forma operating results was as follows. Procedures grew proximately 18% over the first quarter of last year. We shipped 133 da Vinci Surgical Systems up from a 110 in the first quarter of 2016. Revenue for the quarter was $674 million, up 13% from the prior year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $381 million, up 18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total recurring revenue in the quarter was $521 million, representing 77% of total revenue. Gross profit margin was 72% compared to 70% in the first quarter of last year. We generated a pro forma operating profit of $264 million in the quarter, up 15% from the first quarter of last year, and pro forma net income was $196 million, up 15% from Q1 of 2016. In the quarter, we also entered into a stock repurchase agreement in the amount of $2 billion. Marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our product pipeline, as you know, we\u2019ve increased our mid and long-term investments in creating our next-generation of products and services. Based on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable more minimally invasive surgery, better outcomes, and to expand access to our technologies globally. To bring these investments to market, we have developed a product pathway that responds to our customer\u2019s desire for choice in clinical capability and choice in total economics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the next several quarters, we plan to launch a new technology upgrade to Si, named da Vinci X that enables a compelling entry point to our advanced technologies. da Vinci Xi will remain our flagship and we will provide customers with logical upgrade paths for more affordable entry-level systems like Si and X to Si and Sp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have submitted our documents for CE Mark review for X and anticipate it will be available in Europe in the second quarter, with clearances in other regions following over time. We\u2019ll provide you with additional information on X as it launches. The upcoming availability of da Vinci X has some accounting implications, which Marshall will describe in greater detail later in the call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Sp program continues to progress in its clinical trial work and new site initiation. Cases at our active trial site in Asia have included transoral, urologic and colorectal surgery. We\u2019re also on track in initiating our U.S. IDE sites to gather clinical data in transoral surgery. In reviewing feedback from surgeons in Asia and the latest standards for human factors validations, we have elected to pull forward a software release for Sp ahead of our urology 510(k).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This will pushback our urology 510(k) submission into the back-half of 2017 and it\u2019s likely to delay launch of Sp in the U.S. by one or two quarters. While I\u2019m disappointed by the delay, we believe this simplifies our submission and our ultimate path to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our flexible robotics program, we completed our first clinical experience in Australia in the quarter. Surgeon commentary on its performance has been enthusiastic. There are finishing patient follow-up and preparing their manuscript for publication. The overall program is now in its design for pilot production phase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, the first quarter of 2017 has been a busy one for Intuitive. We remain focused on the following for the balance of the year: first, continued adoption of da Vinci in general surgery; second, continued development of European markets and access to customers in Asia; third, advancing our new platform, imaging advanced instruments, da Vinci Sp, and diagnostic platform progress; and finally, support for additional clinical and economic validation by global region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marshall who will review financial highlights.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marshall Mohr</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Gary. I would describe our results in a non-GAAP or pro forma basis, which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals, stock-based compensation, excess tax benefits related to employee stock awards, and amortization of purchased IP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We provide pro forma information, because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro-forma basis. I will also summarize our GAAP results later in my script. We have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our GAAP results on our website, so that there is no confusion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter 2017 revenue was $674 million, an increase of 13% compared with $595 million for the first quarter of 2016, and a decrease of a 11% compared with the fourth quarter revenue of $757 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Gary outlined, we\u2019ll be launching da Vinci X system in certain markets pending appropriate regulatory clearances. In conjunction with the launch, we will offer customers who purchased systems in the first quarter the opportunity to upgrade, or trade out their systems for the X system. As a result, we deferred $23 million of fist quarter revenue and consistent with prior deferral, this revenue will be recognized when customers either trade out their systems, or when the offers expire, whichever comes first.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter 2017 procedures increased nearly 18% compared with the first quarter of 2016, and increased 2% compared with last quarter. Procedure growth relative to last year and the fourth quarter has been driven by general surgery in the U.S. and urology worldwide, and reflects the benefit of Easter Holiday being in the second quarter of 2017 rather than the first quarter of 2016. Patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenue highlights are as follows. Instrument and accessory revenue of $381 million increased 18% compared with last year and decreased 1% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, which closely reflects procedure growth. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure compared with $1,830 last year and $1,900 last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The increase relative to the first quarter of 2016, primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products, mostly offset by customer buying patterns. The decrease compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">System revenue of $153 million, which excludes the revenue deferred in conjunction with the customer trade-out program increased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 35% compared with last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher system placements and higher lease buyout and operating lease revenue, partially offset by the revenue deferral and lower average selling prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects seasonally lower number of systems, the revenue deferral, and lower average selling prices, partially offset by higher lease related revenue. 133 systems replaced in the first quarter of 2017 compared with 110 systems in the first quarter of 2016 and 163 systems last quarter. 21 systems were placed under operating these transactions in the current quarter compared with 19 systems in the first quarter of 2016, and 13 last quarter. As a reminder, revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the lease \u2013 life of the lease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As of the end of the first quarter, there were 95 systems up in the field under operating leases. We generated approximately $5 million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter, compared with $4 million in the first quarter of 2016, and approximately $5 million last quarter. We generated approximately $10 million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with $6 million in the first quarter of 2016, and $7 million last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Globally, our average selling price, which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was $1.46 million compared with $1.5 million last year and $1.48 million last quarter. The decrease in ASP compared to the fourth quarter primarily reflects geographic mix. The decrease compared to last year primarily reflects a higher proportion of Si refurbished systems sold to cost-sensitive market segments. We expect lower price systems to be \u2013 to cost-sensitive market segments to represent an increasing proportion of our sales in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Service revenue of $140 million increased 13% year-over-year and increased approximately 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da Vinci systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Outside of the U.S., results were as follows. First quarter revenue outside of the U.S. of $183 million increased 12% compared with $164 million for the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 14% compared with $212 million for the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue increased 23% compared to previous year and 5% compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting procedure growth, partially offset by customer buying patterns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Systems revenue decreased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and decreased 39% compared with the previous quarter. The decrease in OUS systems revenue relative to both the prior year and the prior quarter reflect lower system ASPs, reflecting sales of Si refurbished product to cost-sensitive market segments, revenue deferrals, operating leases fixed in the current quarter versus none in the prior year and two in the prior quarter, geographic mix, and changes in the number of systems placed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Outside the U.S., we placed 56 systems in the quarter compared with 36 in the first quarter of 2016, and 63 systems last quarter. The decrease in the system \u2013 in system placements relative to the prior quarter, primarily reflects seasonality. The increase in system placements relative to the prior year reflects higher sales into Europe, Korea, and India.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Current quarter system placement included 21 into Europe, seven into Korea, six into India, six in Japan, and two into China. System placements outside of the U.S. will continue to be lumpy, as some of the OUS markets are in the early stages of adoption, some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns, and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to the remainder of the P&amp;L. The pro forma gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 72% compared with 70% for the first quarter of 2016 and 71% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase compared to the prior year reflects reduced product costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, the higher gross margin reflects a higher mix of instrument and accessory revenue relative to systems revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Since we deferred costs associated with the $23 million revenue deferral, the trade-out program had a little impact on our margins. Future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products, the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue, our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency, and in the long-term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pro forma operating expenses increased 19% compared with the first quarter of 2016 and increased 1% compared with last quarter. The increases are consistent with our planned investments in product development, specifically da Vinci Sp, flexible robotics, imaging and advanced instrumentation, and the expansion of our OUS market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our pro forma effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.1% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.4% for the first quarter of 2016 and 26.9% last quarter. Our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of U.S. and OUS income and with the impact of one-time items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first quarter 2017 pro forma net income, which excludes income associated with the revenue deferral was $196 million, or $5.09 per share, compared with $170 million, or $4.42 per share for the first quarter of 2016, and $242 million, or $6.09 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The $23 million revenue deferral, including the associated deferral, the cost of sales, and income tax effect reduced GAAP and pro forma net income per diluted share by approximately $0.28 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earnings per share benefited from our $2 billion stock buyback, because our average shares outstanding were reduced by 1.7 million shares, as we retired 2.4 million shares on January 27, 2017. Our final delivery of shares under the ASR if any will be delivered at the end of the contract period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I indicated earlier, pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends. I will now summarize our GAAP results. GAAP net income was $180 million, or $4.67 per share for the first quarter of 2017, compared with $136 million, or $3.54 per share for the first quarter of 2016, and $204 million, or $5.13 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP net income for the first quarter included $21 million of litigation charges compared with $2 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $6 million last quarter. The first quarter charges included approximately $14 million for the estimated cost of settling product liability claims covered by tolling agreements. We\u2019ve made substantive progress resolving over 90% of the tolled cases. The remainder of the first quarter charges is related to a settlement of the dispute over a license and supply agreement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beginning in 2017, we were required under GAAP to report the excess tax benefits, or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to paid-in capital in prior periods. The excess tax benefit included in our GAAP results for the first quarter was $33 million, contributing $0.85 per share. We have excluded this benefit from our pro forma result. This amount will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises and the number of RSUs vesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the quarter with cash and investments of $3.1 billion, down from $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects our $2 billion stock buyback, partially offset by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I would like to turn it over to Patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Clingan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Marshall. Of our first quarter procedure growth of nearly 18%, U.S. procedures grew approximately 14% and outside of the United States, procedures grew approximately 28%. Procedure growth benefited from tailwinds from the shift of the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2, which had the greatest impact on our European business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding the benefit from these tailwinds, our procedure performance exceeded our expectations during the quarter. The United States both mature and growth procedures such as general and thoracic surgery outperformed our plan. Though difficult to assess, strength in the U.S. may have been due to a short-term uptick in patients seeking care ahead of any potential healthcare reform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In U.S. urology, the first quarter growth rate for da Vinci prostatectomy was similar to 2016. We believe that our U.S. prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market. Earlier this month, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF proposed a change to its 2012 guidance around PSA screening from recommending against screening at any age to encouraging individual patients and physicians to consider PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are pleased to see the USPSTF more closely aligned its recommendation with guidelines from the American Urological Association. In U.S. gynecology, first quarter procedure growth sustained trends observed during 2016. Procedure growth in U.S. GYN appears to be driven by consolidation of surgeries towards physicians that specialize in complex and cancer surgery, who tend to be users of da Vinci system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First quarter U.S. general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remained strong, led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures. Hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the United States and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains encouraging. Trends in lobectomies and other thoracic procedures continue to show early-stage adoption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning abroad, procedures outside of the United States \u2013 procedure growth outside of the United States was approximately 28% in the first quarter, led by the global adoption of da Vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures, general surgery, and gynecology. As I mentioned earlier, the shift of the timing of the Easter holidays from Q1 into Q2 serves as a tailwind in the quarter, likely contributing an estimated 3% to our 28% procedure growth outside of the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Procedure growth was led by Europe, China, and South Korea. In Europe, procedure growth benefited from the Q1 calendar tailwind, but also showed strength on an organic basis. Procedure growth in China was driven by a strong expansion in system utilization. The system placements remain constrained pending the issuance of the new quota for civilian hospitals. In South Korea, procedure growth is driven by a mix of specialties and procedures in addition to a recent uptick in system placements over the past several quarters. Recently, procedure growth in Japan as well as dVP penetration has grown above 80%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, clinical study being conducted to support a reimbursement submission for gastrectomy completed an enrolment. Over the past several months, new clinical evidences highlighted the role of da Vinci in treatment of gastric cancers in Asia. Case series comparing da Vinci to open or laparoscopic procedures have emerged from both South Korea and Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dr. Yang and colleagues from Yonsei University Health System compared all three modalities of surgery across nearly 1,000 patients, an article published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology. The authors found that the da Vinci patient cohort had the highest rate of surgical success compared to open or laparoscopic procedures, while experiencing a reduction in major in hospital complications, a reduction in positive resection margin, and improved lymph node yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dr. Uyama and colleagues from Fujita Health University published a letter in the Annals of Laparoscopic and Endoscopic Surgery highlighting prior work on over 500 radical prostatectomies for gastric cancer. The authors found that exchange for greater blood loss and operating time. da Vinci prostatectomy was associated with a reduction in complications and length of hospitalization compared to laparoscopic gastrectomy. In addition, the authors found that da Vinci patient cohort included a larger proportion of advanced gastric cancers, proposing that da Vinci technology was best for these patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward, during the second quarter, we expect our procedure growth rate outside of the United States to slow, as the calendar tailwind becomes a calendar headwind of similar magnitude during Q2. As we move throughout the year, we also expect the contributions from China and Japan to moderate until we obtain a new quota and place new additional systems in China, and obtain additional procedure reimbursements in Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da Vinci surgery. Of these, I wanted to highlight two additional publications. Dr. Luwan from Baptist Hospital of Miami and colleagues published results from nearly 300 right colectomy patients in the Journal of Surgical Laparoscopy Endoscopy &amp; Percutaneous Techniques.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Comparing da Vinci surgery with intracorporeal anastomosis to laparoscopic surgery with extracorporeal anastomosis, the authors found that while patients in da Vinci cohort have longer operating times, they experienced less blood loss, shorter incision lengths, and longer specimen lengths. Other clinical endpoints that trended towards improvements in da Vinci patient cohort include readmissions, post-operative complications, lymph node yield, and zero incisional hernia repairs compared to 7% in the laparoscopic cohort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next publication is from Dr. Leon and colleagues from the McGill University in Montreal Canada published an article in the Journal of Gynecology-Oncology on the associated \u2013 to their hospital from adopting da Vinci surgery for gynecologic-oncology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The authors reported that the introduction of da Vinci increased the use of minimally invasive surgery from 15% to 76%, increasing the volume of patients treated by 27% and decreasing in-patient board cost by approximately $5,000 per patient, despite a higher proportion of patients with complex comorbidities, the authors concluded, \u201cOrganizations are beginning to recognize that the economic implications of introducing the robotics program extend beyond the operating room. It is timely to evaluate the broader ripple effects robotics has on hospital departments outside of the operating room.\u201d</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This concludes my remarks. I will now turn the call over to Calvin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Calvin Darling</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Patrick. I will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for 2017. Starting with procedures. On our last call, we estimated full-year 2017 procedure growth of 9% to 12% above the approximately 752,000 procedures performed in 2016. Now, based upon favorable trends and key markets outside of the U.S., U.S. general surgery growth and solid results in mature U.S. procedure categories, we\u2019re increasing our estimate for 2017. We now anticipate full-year 2017 procedure growth within a range of 12% to 14%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect the Q2 procedure growth, procedure rates \u2013 procedure growth rates, particularly in Europe will reflect fewer operating days than in the previous year. In regards to system placements, 21 of our 133 first quarter system placements were structured as operating leases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going forward in 2017, we expect an increasing proportion of system placements to be under operating leases. We have recently expanded our leasing programs in Germany and Korea and in the U.S. more customers are considering operating lease arrangements to acquire da Vinci capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The average selling price for system sold outright will vary quarter-to-quarter based upon factors, including product, regional, and trade and mix. With the upcoming expansion of our value-oriented system offering and increasing placements in the cost-sensitive markets segments, we expect that our average system selling price will trend gradually lower in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we have described, approximately $23 million of product revenue was deferred in Q1 related to our da Vinci X trade-out program. In future quarters, we expect to defer additional revenue related to da Vinci X trade-out offers that we will make to customers in the U.S. and other markets ahead of the availability of the product. We will recognize revenue at the point the trade-out offers are executed or when they expire.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to gross profit. On our last call, we forecast 2017 pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between 69% and 71% of net revenue. We now expect our full-year 2017 gross profit margin to be in the upper-half of that range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to operating expenses. As we have described previously, we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the long run. Accordingly, we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution. On our last call, we forecast pro forma 2017 operating expenses to grow between 15% and 18% above 2016 levels. We now anticipate coming in at the higher-end of that range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consistent with our last call, we expect non-cash stock compensation expense to range between $190 million and $200 million in 2017 compared to $178 million in 2016. We expect 2017 other income to be between $30 million and $35 million, compared to the $25 million to $30 million range forecast on our last call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to income tax. Consistent with previous guidance, we expect our 2017 pro forma income tax rate to be between 26.5 and 28.5 of pre-tax income depending primarily on the mix of U.S. and international profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During Q1, we had $38.5 million diluted shares outstanding for EPS calculations. As Marshall described, in connection with our accelerated share buyback program, on January 27, we took delivery and retired approximately 2.4 million shares, representing the initial delivery from Goldman Sachs. Based upon the timing of this transaction during the quarter, about 1.7 million shares were reduced from our Q1 share count. The remaining 700,000 of the 2.4 million share reduction will be realized in Q2, reflecting the full quarter impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The final delivery of shares under the program, if any, will be delivered at the end of the contract period in November. Beyond the accelerated buyback, our actual Q2 shares outstanding will also be affected by the impact of employee option grants, share price, and other diluted share calculation inputs, as well as any other buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes our prepared comments. We will now open the call for your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, yes, good afternoon. Can you hear me, okay?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marshall Mohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, good afternoon. So, I guess, the first thing I\u2019d like to ask about is your announcement on da Vinci X. And it sounds like if you\u2019re deferring revenue now that the timing of this is fairly imminent. So is it safe to assume that X will be launching this calendar year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We plan to launch in Europe first and we are in the process of the CE Markreview. We expect that we\u2019ll pass through that review in the next quarter or so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then there are couple of other follow-ups in terms of U.S. timing. And then, Gary, can you just describe this a little bit more? I think you said it was an add-on to Si. I\u2019m just curious is this technology primarily a lower-priced offering, or is it going to be positioned as a tool for new settings, or new surgical markets? I just wanted to try to get a better understanding of what kind of new market opportunity that this is addressing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So let me describe a little bit of what it is first. It really combines our latest instrument accessory, robotic, and computing and imaging technology with an Si patients cart chassis. This brings to market advanced upgrade package for Si technology that\u2019s lost between the Si and the Xi in terms of its breadth of clinical reach. And it creates an attractive entry point for either an upgrade or a new install.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that it will do well in places that Si does well today and adds to it some of the Xi technologies at an attractive economic place. Where that goes in terms of treatment locations, we\u2019ll see. I think it will be well received.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly, I guess, on da Vinci X. Can you just talk about what sort of difference in price point are we talking about here? And what sort of difference in functionality if it\u2019s primarily addressing similar kind of surgical opportunities, I\u2019m just curious to any sense for what\u2019s the ASP difference and the functionality difference that would be very helpful? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. You\u2019ll have to wait on ASPs. We aren\u2019t announcing it at this time just directionally it will be between Sis and Xis. In terms of capability, again, we\u2019ll, as we launch, we\u2019ll give you additional information in terms of future benefit. It isn\u2019t foundational in terms of the types of procedures it can do. It will make Sis more capable to more comfortably do more procedures. So Xi will remain the top of the line. Xi has intraoperative table motion. It has automated help and set up an optimization and multi quadrant functions that X will not have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And could it launch in the U.S. this year, that\u2019s my last question?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is possible, but we haven\u2019t yet called the end date in terms of launch time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Hazan with Citi. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Hazan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Hey, good afternoon, guys. Let me just start maybe with the da Vinci Sp delay and just ask for a little bit more color just specifically what happened to get you to drive that delay? And then also other than the software upgrade, are you pretty much ready for the 510(k) filing in terms of the clinical results you wanted to have?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the clinical side has been really good. We\u2019re feeling great about our clinical experience and overall product performance. We do \u2013 we did learn some things in our trial that we want to make a little easier, it has to do with making it a little bit easier to set up and a little bit smoother and optimize workflow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We decided that, given the extensive HF, human factors validations that are required by regulators these days that we would rather do that sooner ahead of the submission than later. And so, we made a decision to go ahead and pull that software release forward into those validations on the newly released software.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m not foundationally upset about where we are with regard to Sp. You get out and you learn. I\u2019d like to take those learnings and put them back in the product and get on with it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Hazan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just two quick questions on guidance. First, on the gross margin side, I think, I want to try to understand you had another really good gross margin quarter and your guidance is still kind of a little bit below where we were last year. But it seems like the same drivers are in place, lower cost and new products, managing fixed costs well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m just trying to understand if this is conservatism by you, or if you\u2019re actually starting to think about some of the \u2013 maybe da Vinci X products coming through and that\u2019s why the guidance is lower, what else is the offset versus what you\u2019ve been able to achieve over the last five quarters?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Calvin Darling</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Amit, this is Calvin, and we\u2019re definitely pleased with our Q1 gross profit results and our continued progress to reduce costs and improve efficiency, as Marshall took you through. And as such, we did take up our guidance to the upper-half of the 69% to 71% range. But you look at specifically in Q1, the gross margin of 72% in the quarter benefited from product mixes, 77% of our revenue is from higher margin recurring revenue and 23% came from lower margin capital. Also during the quarter again, we had very few charges associated with field actions, excess, obsolete inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as we look forward into the balance of 2017, we think the margin will be impacted by things, including of course, capital sales comprising a higher proportion of the revenue and that mix factor, there will be some costs start to build up that \u2013 to support the manufacturers some of the new products. We are assuming a higher field action and charges more aligned with historic ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, as I talked about in the prepared comments, some directionally lower system ASPs as we expand our value-oriented system offering and increased placements in the cost-sensitive market segments, and of course, the margin will vary quarter-to-quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Hazan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just lastly, for me on \u2013 is on the procedure guidance. So if I\u2019m kind of hearing you correctly putting all the pieces together, you had some selling day impact that you\u2019re calling out for the first time really, I\u2019m assuming you kind of knew that ahead of time, so I don\u2019t know how much that has an impact on your new higher guidance, but maybe a comment on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, in addition to that, you talked about strong kind of legacy growth, but your legacy growth was right in line with where it\u2019s been more recently. So I\u2019m just wondering is the net effect that the higher guidance for you comes really from general surgery in the U.S., that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the higher number?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, there\u2019s a lot of factors. Again overall, we\u2019re again very pleased with our Q1 procedure results and growth trends, and we do expect 2017 procedure growth to continue to be driven by U.S. general surgery and international procedures. We\u2019re still very early stages of adoption in these categories. And again, we raised our guidance in the quarter from 9 to 12 to 12 to 14, so it\u2019s reflecting our increased confidence overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But at the end, we feel like our Q1 results were exceptional in the quarter. And going forward, we would expect some moderation in growth in Asia, as Patrick took you through as we await additional da Vinci procedure reimbursement in Japan and sales growth in China. We do expect moderation in the European growth rates due to the timing of the Easter holiday, slight moderation in U.S. mature procedures, which have continued trends, as you mentioned. But dVP and GYN, we\u2019d assume some moderation there. And then just, the overriding uncertainty and policy direction in the United States and what impact that may have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Amit Hazan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fair enough. Thanks, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Just a few quick ones. Gary, just starting off with da Vinci X. for a second here, I wonder what the upgrade electronics package on da Vinci X. Is it going to be possible to upgrade the X with Sp, meaning, will that tower work with Sp, so potentially you can bring Sp to a broader marketplace than we initially thought, which we thought maybe was limited to just Xi?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So it\u2019s a good point, is the \u2013 the answer to that is ultimately, yes. But the competition or hardware platform and the basics are shared across all three X, Xi and ultimately Sp. So in addition to giving people lower entry point on advanced technologies, it gives them logical upgrade pathways to advanced technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect, very clear. And then Gary, just two more quick ones. One on Sp, does this software upgrade, or software pull forward, I should say, does that impact to the timing of the second and third filings you were forecasting out ahead than others?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It does not appear to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then, Gary, the one procedure we talk a lot about prostate, we talk a lot about hernia lately. But this thoracic procedure, or segment has really come into the dialogue the last six months. Can you just talk more about what\u2019s happening in thoracic? How much of it is long resection? How much of this is broad category of VATS surgery? And any you can share with us in terms of market size, stage of inflection, because it\u2019s sort of merged from a nice place to a definitive driver, it\u2019d be helpful to get some clarity? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I think just painting it broad strokes, the opportunity for us in thoracic surgery over time is real. There\u2019s a lot of open surgery in that space. These are complex procedures and delicate surgeries. As we think that sets us up well for da Vinci kind of platform, as we have brought Xi to market with its longer reach, its narrower arms and its set of Xi staplers that has helped.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re seeing what would amount to early interest and early growth in that category. In terms of market sizes and rate of penetration, I \u2013 I\u2019ll let Patrick speak to that a little bit. We still think we\u2019re early. I would also say that, we\u2019ve got our sales force and commercial team really focused primarily on general surgery. I think we want to support that market very well. But Patrick, take it away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Patrick Clingan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at the United States market, there\u2019s probably around 100,000 patients who receive surgery a day, split evenly between lobectomies and other types of thoracic procedures for which we think our products can bring value to patients and surgeons. We look outside the United States beside, markets are much, much larger, particularly when you look to Asia and China in particular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re optimistic about the future. But we\u2019re still in very early days and you\u2019re seeing some of the early evidence that\u2019s come out comparing robotics to open and even VATS surgeries with their improving outcomes and evidence holds up over time. We think there\u2019s a runaway for us here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, David.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll start off with just a couple of clarifications on procedure expectations. Are you factoring in any impact from the USPSTF guidelines? And then, can you comment on hernia ventral versus inguinal? Are you still seeing relatively balanced growth rates between the two?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Patrick Clingan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Tycho, it\u2019s Patrick. From a USPSTF perspective, in 2012 when the original announcement came out, we saw dVP volumes decline over a couple of year period. However, since then you\u2019ve seen our volumes really return to nearly the level they were in 2011. So I think a lot of that has played through, so we\u2019re pleased to see the statement become more aligned to what the AUA society guidelines are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a ventral and inguinal hernia perspective, we remain encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing. You continue to see growth in our existing surgeon populations doing more and more procedures, new surgeons coming along. And there\u2019s a lot of positive energy coming out of society meetings like the American Hernia Society and the SAGES meeting. So we continue to be pleased by the adoption that we\u2019re seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on Sp, I know you suggested the software release would necessarily impact the timing for follow-on procedures down in urology. Can you maybe just help us think of when you may have those filings for the follow-on procedures? And also, when can we get a readout from the first clinical experience in Australia? Is that something that would be published.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So two different things there; one is Sp and one is our flexible robotics program. But just going to Sp to start, we have not yet settled on submission timelines for the additional indications on Sp beyond urology. We are imminently initiating the transoral surgery trials, and then we\u2019ll open colorectal trials thereafter, but we have not yet set dates publicly for when we expect those submissions. That said, the software update we\u2019re doing vis-\u00e0-vis the urology filing should not disrupt the timeline of those two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to the work that was done in Australia that was on the flexible robotics platform, they are in patient follow-up now. So they\u2019re following patients after their treatment for the prescribed amount of time in their protocol. I\u2019d expect them to be presenting publicly in the fall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We now have a question from Tao Levy with Wedbush. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tao Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks. Good afternoon. So I had a question on the X \u2013 on the da Vinci X. Are the instruments similar to the Xi, or it\u2019s still going to be a different course set of instruments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good question. The instruments on X are the same family as the Xi, so there are generation 2 advanced instrument kit. So things like stapling and vessel sealing, or gen 2, they are the same exact instruments, same part numbers as the Xi likewise with the imaging system. So if you\u2019re on account that has multiple systems, you have Xis and Sis then moving to X can standardize your Si base and have one set of instruments and accessories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tao Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gotcha. And the pricing pathway for an upgrade from an Si to and an X outside of obviously the deferral?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So not \u2013 we haven\u2019t published yet what the list price steps are going to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tao Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay And just lastly, I asked this question last quarter, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any update on the quota from China? Is that still something you expect over the near-term? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Marshall Mohr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There really \u2013 this is Marshal. There really isn\u2019t much of an update as we\u2019ve previously communicated. We\u2019re still waiting for a quota, which would cover the civilian hospitals in China, and we\u2019ll keep you informed as we hear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tao Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Henry with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brandon Henry</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks for taking my question. First, can you talk about the dynamic? You mentioned of patients coming in for surgery ahead of potential healthcare reform changes, and what you heard from surgeons regarding that dynamic? And then should we expect this similar dynamic to occur in the second quarter? And I have a couple of follow-ups?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Gary. I don\u2019t think we have a deep insight there. There has been a little bit of speculation that there has been some pull forward. We have seen just in the numbers a little more buoyance kind of broadly across our procedure base not just in the single category, but kind of across each category, which leaves us to believe there\u2019s something environmental going on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would not say that we have special insight. I think it\u2019s a little bit of speculation we\u2019ll know in the future quarters. I cannot predict what will happen Q2, Q3 with regard to how ACA dynamics will occur.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brandon Henry</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then and separately on the international side, I think the company breaks at international procedures by prostatectomy, hysterectomy in kind of other bucket. The other bucket has become the larger portion of the international procedures, but we don\u2019t really have a lot of visibility into the underlying trends there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So can you just spend sometime discussing what specific countries our procedures are driving that continued 30% plus growth in the other bucket and your confidence that that rate of growth continuing for the other category going forward? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Patrick Clingan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sure, Brandon, it\u2019s Patrick. We continue to see most of our outside of the United States procedure growth being driven by urology, mostly prostatectomy and dVP, but also in kidney repairs, mainly through partial nephrectomies to which the system tends to be an enabler for population of patients to access partial nephrectomy for kidney cancers. We also do see encouraging signs in general surgery and gynecology, stronger in Asia and in certain markets in Europe, where we\u2019ve already deeply penetrated urology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brandon Henry</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lawrence Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, if I focus on the pipeline, any updates on the new technologies that you\u2019re working on the imaging agent and additional instruments? And I had one follow up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Imaging trial on the uro imaging agent is initiated so far so good. We\u2019re still early in that trial, but we\u2019re pleased. Otherwise our imaging programs are progressing against our plan. Your second question was on, I\u2019m sorry advanced?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lawrence Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additional instruments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Instrumentation. We have a portfolio of instruments we\u2019re working on nothing to really call out in terms of dates for you. We are making progress on expanding our stapler line to be a full line stapling system, but nothing I call out for you on this call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lawrence Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gary, let me ask one on the competition. So Medtronic has talked about bundling their surgical portfolio to drive sales of their robot assuming they have a competitive offering. Can you talk about things you could do such as partnering to mitigate that advantage that they could have? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think \u2013 the way we think about it in terms of servicing our customer is to allow them to have a minimally invasive surgery program that they get the outcomes they want to across a broad population of patients and surgeons. We think that our technologies are outstanding and we\u2019ll continue to be market leading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To the extent that they need to augment a robotic system with other products, there are a plethora of other companies that are happy to sell into surgical suites. And I think as long as those were at an economically attractive price point and the products are well accepted, I think, we\u2019re going to be in good shape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lawrence Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thanks for taking the questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And our next question will come from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Newitter</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks a lot for squeezing me in here. I just the first one, coming out of SAGES, we noticed just a palpable kind of acceptance \u2013 increased acceptance of hernia procedures in general, multiple kind of podium sessions devoted to it. So just wondering, is there that acceptance that you\u2019re seeing, so that we saw do you guys feel that kind of there has been a notable inflection in the acceptance of kind of hernia robotic hernia surgery? And would you be willing to kind of give us an updated kind of sense of where we are on the market opportunities within ventral and hernia \u2013 inguinal how big they are and kind of where you think that could go from your addressable market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think in the first part of your question where are we in acceptance? I think that you\u2019re seeing some early exploration and enthusiasm and we\u2019re feeling that enthusiasm as well. But as you well know the surgical population is not of one mind. And I think that we\u2019re going to see pro-conned dates in hernia for sometime, and I would expect that. And I think it will be challenged and debated and discussed variance by patient population, variance by surgical technique, and variance by total economics to treat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That leads to your second question, which is are we ready to make any changes to our thoughts on estimated market size? And I think it\u2019s really too early to try to redraw boundaries there. So the summary for us is so far so good. I think, surgeons are finding real value and pursuing that value. They\u2019re doing what I think they should in terms of assessing it carefully and publishing the results and debating, which patient groups and subgroups make sense, and we\u2019ll support them in that effort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Newitter</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the ACA kind of some of the dynamic that might be playing out in the marketplace. I\u2019m just wondering on the capital side and on the decision-maker side of the equation and hospitals institutions, any updates on what you\u2019re hearing from customers on kind of their willingness to invest in innovation like robotics?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think on the one hand in a good way a lot of people understand the basic value proposition of robotics are familiar with the kinds of things they can do. So that has led to, I think meaningful conversations that are data driven and effective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think on the margins right now, the ACA has injected some caution on the part of capital buyers. So on the positive side, I think, robotics the value it can bring is pretty well understood. On the negative side, I think, on the margin at the outside it\u2019s been \u2013 ACA uncertainty has been a slight negative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Richard Newitter</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise with Stifel. Go ahead please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon, everybody. Hi, Gary. Just a big picture question, first. I mean, I would assume you\u2019d think that the opportunity for robotics and surgery is under penetrated. I\u2019m just sort of fascinated with the several times you\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 you Marshall, Calvin had mentioned that average selling prices will trend lower because of new products and mix here. Just stepping back from both specifics, how do we think about the opportunity for a lower-priced system perhaps driving increase penetration?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, is this the next leg in robotic market penetration? And does da Vinci X and Sp and should we think about that more specifically as one of the next big opportunities as opposed to just a procedure, or a geography if you see what I\u2019m getting on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll answer a little simpler question that you asked. I think we have been in close contact with our customers, particularly those outside the United States and have been listening carefully to what kind of procedures they want to do, what the reimbursement environments are in their countries, and what kind of capabilities need to match that procedure set and reimbursement set, and we think X fits that bill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as a result, I think that it will be well received. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s limited to a single country. I do think that we believe and I think our customers believe the total cost to treat is the right economic measures, that better outcomes followed by economic analysis to look at total cost to treat. And to the extent that your technology offering can match that, so that you get both great outcomes and lower total cost to treat that will drive adoption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How big, how fast X goes? We don\u2019t have a crystal ball. But we have invested in it based on some conversations and research we think was right. I think that is going to hit the mark for them, and we will be delighted to report to you in future quarters how it\u2019s going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And Gary, just a follow-on to that. So just to be very clear, I mean, this is not, \u201cJust an upgrade for existing Xi installed base, it is that, but it\u2019s definitely something much broader potentially\u201d?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You can \u2013 if one has an Si then you can upgrade to Xi to an X. If you have no system and you want to get started then you can buy an X to get started.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And you didn\u2019t mention, I know it\u2019s small table motion this quarter. Just out of curiosity where are we with adoption and the uptake there? Is it going as you expected and planned?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. At the top level, attach rate of table motion has exceeded our initial expectations and kind of our original business plan for that product. I think with regard to the last quarter, I would imagine, I look at Patrick about\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Patrick Clingan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very solid attach rates with new Xi system sales. We\u2019ve worked largely through the existing population of customers. So we are not seeing as much on a year-over-year basis as we saw when the product launched.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just last for me on Fosun. Any milestones we should expect and, let\u2019s say, the next 12 months on the program? And maybe just more broadly, how do we think about this partnership\u2019s impact, if anything now looking ahead on the broader high surge Chinese business, and especially given the complex geopolitical situation? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Guthart</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. With regard to Fosun, I think, I\u2019d focus the audience on really two things. One is the technical progress of the flexible robotics platform, because we think that\u2019s a major component. And then the other one will be our activities in building that organization, hiring staff. As the organization builds out, then we\u2019ll announce to you kind of where we are. I gave you an update on where we are in the flex robotics program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are very bullish on the interest in and the value that robotic surgery can bring to China. We have the right partner in Fosun. Over time, that partnership exists today in the form of our distribution relationship with one of their subsidiaries in Chindex, that will grow into the relationship into a full JV. And we will navigate the international waters as need be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gary Guthart</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So thank you for the question. That was our last one. As we\u2019ve said previously, while we focus on financial metrics, such as revenue, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things, which really make a difference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and look forward to talking to your again in three months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.</p>", "twitContent": "$ISRG - Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) CEO Gary Guthart on Q1 2017 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4063232-intuitive-surgicals-isrg-ceo-gary-guthart-on-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2479", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17896", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17908", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4063232-intuitive-surgicals-isrg-ceo-gary-guthart-on-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4063232-intuitive-surgicals-isrg-ceo-gary-guthart-on-q1-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
