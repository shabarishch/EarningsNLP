On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions.</p> <p>Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.</p> <p>Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today as well as those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.</p> <p>With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p> <p><strong>Mike Corbat</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. Today, we\u2019ve reported earnings for the first quarter of 2020, with net income<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> of $2.5 billion, we had earnings per share of $1.05. Our earnings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic weren\u2019t felt until late in the quarter and we continue to show expense discipline. However, as you would expect, credit costs reduced<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> our net income. The significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the Day-2 impact of the new CECL accounting standard.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our Institutional Clients Group, we had strong performance in our markets business as we help clients navigate severe volatility that led to trading revenues that were higher than last year and what is typically a strong quarter for that business as it is. Treasury and trade solutions was impacted by the cuts to interest rates, but client engagement stayed very strong throughout the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Investment Banking matched last year\u2019s solid performance as we continue to gain share among our target clients. Global Consumer Banking also fared well from a revenue perspective, considering the environment. In the US, and its strong revenue growth in cards with branded in retail services of 7% and 4%, respectively. We grew average deposits 8% with another solid portion acquired digitally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Asia, we saw a slight revenue decline as the economic impacts of COVID-19 first materialized in that region. In Mexico, revenues rose modestly, excluding a one-time gain from 2019 as the virus had limited impact on that country\u2019s economy during the quarter. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.52 at the end of the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.2% as our risk weighted assets increased significantly due to increased client demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I\u2019ve said, this isn\u2019t a financial crisis, it\u2019s a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications. Although we did have good revenue performance this quarter, we exited the quarter in a dramatically different environment. While we\u2019ve built significant loan loss reserves, no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virus\u2019s impact on the global economy will be. That said, we entered this crisis in a very strong position from a capital, liquidity and balance sheet perspective. We have the resources we need to serve our clients without jeopardizing our safety and soundness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight some of the things that we\u2019re doing to help our people, clients and communities which you can see on Slide 3. I have to say I\u2019m very proud of how our people have responded to this fast-moving situation. We\u2019ve been very aggressive, shifting to remote working to reduce our people\u2019s chances of becoming infected, where the spread of the virus dictates it, we only have people going to our sites if there\u2019s no possible way, they can perform their roles remotely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, last week in North America Markets and Securities Services 98% of our people worked remotely and globally, our people adapted well to this new way of working with over 80% of our colleagues working remotely. Investments we\u2019ve made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that would have been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether it\u2019s a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity. Our investments in risk management and controls will never complete are also serving us well in the face of the severe economic downturn and large swings across markets, whether in equities, fixed income or commodities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduce the stress they\u2019re facing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We decided last month to make a one-time payment of $1,000 to employees who make $60,000 or less per year in the US that are making equivalent payments in our international markets. And we\u2019ve halted new reductions in our workforce for the time being.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a consumer and institutional perspective, we\u2019re well positioned to serve the clients and the customer segments we\u2019ve been focusing on. We know many consumers are facing real struggles, and we\u2019re doing our best to support them. We were quick to implement the ways to reduce the burden on our consumer appliance and announced additional accommodations last week in the US. While we haven\u2019t been a large player in small business lending, we\u2019re ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the Payroll Protection Plan, and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re working hard to support our corporate clients, many of whom are facing financial pressure. We\u2019ve been able to support them, while keeping within our risk and liquidity limits. We\u2019ve also been helping the communities we served during this extraordinarily difficult time, partnering with groups like the World Health Organizations, Citi\u2019s foundations have already committed $30 million today to support those impacted and we\u2019ll make additional announcements in coming days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve donated personal protective equipment, the hospital workers and last week we started using our cafeteria in our headquarters to make meals for food banks. Our people keep coming up with new ways to help and I couldn\u2019t be prouder. And as a Bank, we\u2019ll do everything we can to support the broader economy. We serve as the transmission mechanism for policymakers for both fiscal and monetary, which they can use as a bridge to the real economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward, there are too many unknowns to count. The path that virus will chart, whether there will be successful interventions, the action government leaders will take either reopen the economy or put in place measures that will further restrict it. We also have to bear in mind, COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical guidance continues to evolve, as you would expect. But we feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that, Mark will go through our presentations and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Mason</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4, Citigroup reported first quarter net income of $2.5 billion. Results included a $4.9 billion increase in credit reserves this quarter. This reserve increased reflects the impact of changes in our economic outlook due to COVID-19. These builds are larger, given a significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new CECL standard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenues of $20.7 billion grew 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio. Expenses were roughly flat year-over-year, and we were able to deliver positive operating leverage and a 27% improvement in operating margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Credit costs were $7 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 19% for the first quarter, below our full year outlook, reflecting a small benefit associated with stock-based incentive compensation. The ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impact that we are already seeing varies across our franchise. We saw the earliest impact on consumer behavior in Asia as spending slowed in response to restrictions on travel and other commercial activity. We\u2019re seeing the same pattern today here in the US and now beginning in Mexico, which is likely to put pressure on loan balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, deposit growth remains strong across regions and we\u2019re leveraging digital channels to engage with our client. The rate environment has changed significantly. Our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three US rate cuts seen last year, as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis, with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Although I would know that this has been partially offset in areas like TTS, where clients are moving volumes towards us as a stable partner of choice. A similar dynamic is playing out in markets, where we are also seen as a counterparty of choice. Additionally, we are seeing higher corporate loan volumes reflecting drawdowns and new facilities given our clients response to the crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, our performance in investment banking reflects the market volatility we\u2019ve seen, as well as the uncertainty that remains on the corporate side. From the onset, we\u2019ve been focused on our employees and our clients and ensuring we maintain balance sheet strength to serve them through this uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As of March 31st, our CET 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, below our stated target of 11.5% even our efforts to support our clients through this period. Additionally, we had over $800 billion in available liquidity to help support our clients, and including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power, we are operating from a position of strength. We\u2019re combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 2% as growth in North America was partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, reflecting the initial impact of COVID-19 on customer behavior. Expenses were roughly flat, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and 5% improvement in operating margin. Total credit costs of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Although the impact of COVID-19 has only been felt in North America in recent weeks, we have leveraged our experience in Asia to inform our response strategy. We\u2019re one of the first banks in the US to provide assistance to help impacted customers starting in early March. We\u2019ve since expanded that support and continue to evaluate whether additional support is needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this pricing. Digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at $1.6 billion. We continue to drive mobile adoption of 13% year-over-year. We made change to allow our customers to use self service channels for more transactions, including increased limits for ATM withdrawals, mobile check deposits and Zelle transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve continued to launch new digitally led value proposition such as Citi Wealth Builder, a new digital investment platform for clients in the emerging affluent segments. These capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients, even as roughly 40% of our branches in the US are now temporarily closed, driven by lower customer traffic, particularly in urban areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the businesses. Branded cards revenue of $2.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to 933 basis points this quarter. Client engagement remained strong through February with purchase sales growth of roughly 10% for the first two months of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, as seen across the industry, purchase sales declined significantly in late March with the implementation of more extensive lockdowns in many states. Categories like travel and entertainment have seen the biggest impact, while there has been some offset from higher spending on essentials as well as higher online sales. So in total, we grew a purchase sale of 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits of 8%. As I noted earlier, digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continue to adjust pricing, given the current rate environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also saw a strong engagement with existing clients, driving balanced growth across deposit [technical difficulty], including checking. While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower partner payments and higher average loan. Purchase sales were down 3% year-over-year in the first quarter, again, including significant pressure in late March, driven by reduced client activity and store closures at some of our partners. This is expected to have an impact on new account acquisitions and loan balances as we move through the year. Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume related costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to credit, total credit costs of $3.9 billion increased significantly from last year. We built roughly $2.4 billion in reserves this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook. And net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolio. Our NCL rates in US branded cars and retail services were 346 and 553 basis points, respectively. Consistent with the uptake we\u2019ve typically seen in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Historically, we\u2019ve seen higher NCL rates in the first half versus the second half of the year. However, given the rapidly changing economic environment due to COVID-19, we are likely to see increased pressure on NCL rates in the back half of 2020, consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 1% year-over-year in the first quarter. Despite the early emergence of COVID-19 in the region, we saw strong investment in FX revenues through most of the quarter. This was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business, driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also saw an impact on customer acquisitions in products like insurance, which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit growth remained strong at 8% this quarter, and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise. Today, we are seeing some early signs that we\u2019ll pick up in activity in China as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so. But that is a small consumer business for us and of course, many other markets are still in an earlier stage of managing through the crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues were largely unchanged year-over-year and grew 3% excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 4%. And we\u2019re also benefitting from improved spreads in card.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, we continue to see pressure on overall loan growth. And while we haven\u2019t yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern we\u2019ve seen in other regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In total, operating expenses for our international business were up 3% in the first quarter, driven by Mexico, reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to $939 million, primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 8 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends, which shows the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Overall, we have not seen a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our credit statistics, but it is still early. We do anticipate rising unemployment and therefore higher loss rates than originally expected for this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, it is unclear what benefit the historic $2 trillion relief package as well as our own customer relief efforts will have in helping to mitigate some of the potential stress on consumers. I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation. And importantly, as I\u2019ve noted on prior calls, we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios, both relative to the industry as well as Citi\u2019s historical risk exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at our US card portfolios as an example, the FICO distributions of our outstanding loans and open to buy exposures due much more towards the higher end than before the 2008 crisis. And as a result, when we stress today\u2019s card portfolios to the same level as 2008, our pro forma loss rates are 25% to 30% lower than experienced in the last crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Asia as you can see from our credit metrics, we maintain a very low risk portfolio targeted at high quality consumers in both our unsecured and mortgage portfolio, where our average LTV is less than 50%. In Mexico, we clearly serve a wider range of clients compared to our other region, given our national footprint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, we generally target a higher quality segment than our local peers. The credit profile of our clients has improved over time, as we have remained disciplined and tightened down lending criteria since the crisis, which is reflected in our more stable NCL rates over the past few years. We generate strong margins in Mexico as well, with a net credit margin of cards for example, of roughly 20%. That said, clearly the impact of COVID-19 is not fully known at this point and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS and corporate lending. The quarter also benefited from the impact of $816 million of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges, as credit spreads widen during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total banking revenues of $5.2 billion decreased 6%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Our global footprint enables us to have a unique relationship with our clients. Even the breadth of that relationship, we\u2019re playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, including 24% growth in end-of-period deposits in constant dollars, as well as 6% growth in cross-border flows. And we continue to see that benefit of our investment in technology, given the accelerated adoption of digital tools. In March, while we, as well as most of our clients were working remotely, we opened close to 1,000 accounts digitally, three times the number we opened digitally in March of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve also seen a rapid growth in CitiDirect users, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter to over 580,000 users. And within that, active mobile users increased tenfold this year. But as we exited the quarter, we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begins to take hold, with revenues down 9% year-over-year in the month of March on a reported basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&amp;A and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting. However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digits year-over-year, as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Private bank revenues of $949 million grew 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions. In higher lending and deposit volumes, partially offset in lower deposit spreads, reflecting the impact of lower interest rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Corporate lending revenues of $448 million were down 40%, primarily reflecting an adjustment to the residual value of the lease financing, as well as other marks on the portfolio. And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total markets and Security Services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $4.8 billion to 39% year-over-year, with growth across rates and currencies and commodities. As volatility, volumes and spreads reached record levels, we actively made markets during this turbulent period for both corporate and investor clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility. And finally in security services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, driven by higher client activity and deposit volume partially offset by lower spread.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth. Total credit costs of $2 billion were up significantly from last year, we built roughly $1.9 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves primarily reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as some downgrades along with volume growth in the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As of quarter end, our funded reserve ratio was 81 basis points, including a funded reserve ratio of roughly 2% on the non-investment grade portion. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 57 basis points. Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 10 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses were down 24% as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs, as well as incremental costs associated with COVID-19, including a special compensation award granted to roughly 75,000 employees who are being most directly impacted by COVID-19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the pretax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, locks on security, the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day, along with higher trading related NIR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $330 million, reflecting the lower rate environment, one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that I mentioned earlier. And net interest margin declined 15 basis points sequentially, with lower net interest revenues driving roughly half of the decline and the remainder reflecting growth in the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to non-interest revenue, in the first quarter, healthy business performance for most of the quarter as well as a strong pickup in trading activity in March drove a significant increase in non-interest revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look to the second quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates, as well as a much more pronounced impact from COVID-19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 11.2% driven mostly by the increase in risk weighted assets. The increase in RWA reflected our support to our customers as well as increased market volatility and widening credit spreads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our supplementary in leverage ratio was 6%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $71.52 driven by net income and the reduced share count. In summary, the environment changed dramatically this quarter, but we continue to operate well in a challenging environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the period with a strong capital liquidity position. We certainly saw the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results as we exited the quarter. But we feel good about our ability to manage risk through the cycle. We remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higher quality, more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking to the second quarter and the rest of 2020, let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today. And our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. With that said, given the adverse impact of COVID-19, we no longer expect to deliver a RoTCE of 12% to 13% for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on what we\u2019re seeing today, on the top line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID related lower level of activity, particularly in banking, and our consumer franchise, will continue through much of the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in our markets business, revenue should reflect the broader industry. The first quarter is typically the strongest quarter, and clearly this year was particularly strong, so we would expect some normalization in activity levels here. And finally, we will see the more pronounced impact of the lower rate environment on the top line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the expense side, there are couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses, including the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this. And from this standpoint, we\u2019re being thoughtful about where we need to deploy resources to ensure we can deliver for our customers, in a period where roughly 80% of our workforce is working remotely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Here we feel good about the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years in technology. These investments are allowing us to manage through this period, and support our customers and clients through digital mean. However, I would also note that during these unprecedented times, we are also exploring all opportunities to operate as efficiently as possible and potentially repay certain investments we would have otherwise made, in order to offset some of the headwinds created by COVID-19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We would also expect to see a natural reduction and some volume related expenses, including T&amp;E, meetings and event calls. So again, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty today, but we will have more to say on both the top line impact as well as these efficiency efforts in the coming month as the impact of COVID-19 is better understood. But that should hopefully give you a sense of how we\u2019re thinking about the environment and our pre-provision earnings power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to credit. Looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2020, we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook. And as our outlook continues to evolve, it is also reasonable to expect additional increases in credit reserves if our outlook deteriorates further. However, given the credit quality of our portfolio, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers and win new business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Undoubtedly, every company around the world will feel an economic impact from this unprecedented situation. But we are confident that Citi will emerge in a position of strength, having demonstrated that we lived up to our stated objective to be an indisputably strong and stay institution and having shown that we stood by our clients and supported our customers and employees during this very difficult time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks very much. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019d give us a little bit more of the assumptions behind the reserve build and \u2013 because card is \u2013 is a little bigger for you guys. I\u2019m curious if you could talk about the reserve and how you think about it from a branded versus retail services partner card perspectives? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Good morning, Glenn. So you know, you can turn to page 20, we\u2019ve broken out some additional you know, details here and you can see you know, we started or ended the year, I should say with about $14 billion in reserves, you\u2019re right the lion\u2019s share that is in cards in split between branded you know, and retail and you know our focus obviously is tends to be on the higher \u2013 the higher FICO scored you know, clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services, but not quite as high as on the cards\u2019 side. And so that\u2019s going to you know, impact a little bit the split between the two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You can see in terms of the day one impact that was about $4.1 billion. We talked about that on the last call, and we built another $4.9 billion, so that gets us to a total reserve balance of almost $23 billion. What it point out is you know, the cards piece obviously is at roughly $9.5 billion, but again \u2013 I mean 9.5%, excuse me of LLR to loans. But again you know, we tend to you know, to think of this as a higher quality book.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the factors that become important you know, there are a host of variables that we run through our model, as well as combined with severity of a recession, probability of a recession, I would say that the two most critical as it relates to cards and again, they\u2019re all important in understanding how they work together becomes important. But two very important ones become obviously GDP and unemployment, and how that affects the underlying behavior of the consumer in each of those instances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously, the retail services there, our partners that we have that are you know, more directly impacted by the COVID-19 situation, but we also have the $2 trillion relief stimulus that\u2019s been introduced and a little bit unclear as to how that ultimately plays out and impacts the behavior. So lots of puts and takes going you know, through the model, the \u2013 those economic assumptions change kind of straight through the end of the quarter, but the short of it is that you know, based on our outlook as have been you know, this additional build of $2.4 billion per cards you know was the appropriate amount for us to take.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s a very helpful side. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up on, I\u2019m curious your view, because you\u2019re in the midst of all of it of how much has the financial plumbing been improved by some of the government actions, and then where you, most importantly, where you see that we need the most improvement less to come on the plumbing things like, money markets, CP, I\u2019m talking about reserve banks?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, Glenn, I would say that the actions that we\u2019ve seen out of the combination of the Fed and the Treasury are truly extraordinary, not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs, but I think the breath that\u2019s there and the speed at which they\u2019ve implemented them I mean, whether it\u2019s it's been the CP facility, the money market liquidity facility, the repo facilities, the broader corporate pieces, the SBA loans and now not something that\u2019s being talked about that much, but this main street program that\u2019s there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think from a plumbing perspective, your question\u2019s a good one, because obviously the real economy doesn\u2019t have direct access to the Fed or to the Treasury. And I think if the banks and in particular, the big banks role, one of many roles that we played to be that transmission mechanism between fiscal monetary and the real economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think you can just see in terms of in the early days, how the markets were trading, a lot of the fears and concerns that were there and whether it was the early fears of draws, whether it was the early fears of money funds that being able to get liquidity across the board, and I think the programs have gone a long way. I think that there still a few things out there that probably need some work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And certainly, as an institution, as an industry, we\u2019re in constant dialogue with the Fed and the Treasury on those. And again, as I suspect as those things create challenges, it\u2019s likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies to be able to address it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think the plumbing is actually working pretty well that in spite of working remotely and the numbers that Mark and I spoke to, and we had in late March record volumes of trading in terms of settlement, clearing, margin \u2013 margining in the system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, most of that done remotely and you know, we all would have said to each other 6, 9, 12 months ago you know, we\u2019re going to model for this type of stress, we probably all would have been skeptical in terms of how the system performs. So I\u2019m proud of how we\u2019ve performed and I\u2019m quite pleased so far, how the system has performed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thank you, both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Erika. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Erika.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mark. Hi, I wanted to clarify your statement on card losses. So just want to make sure I was interpreting it correctly. You said that the losses today, the cumulative losses today could be 20% lower than the global financial crisis experienced. And when I look back at the regulatory data, \u201909 and 2010 would add up to a 20% loss rate. So wanted just to make sure I \u2013 we were interpreting that correctly that you know, you could see losses of 15% to 16% in card in a cumulative loss scenario, which is about in line with both the company run DFAST and the Fed stress test?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, sure I mean, what I said was that you know, if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality, then it was back in \u201808, and you were to stress it for the \u201808 financial crisis that yes, our pro forma loss rates would be 25% to 30% lower than what we experienced in the last crisis. That is \u2013 that\u2019s what I see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think to be clear, Erika not \u2013 that\u2019s not a prediction, it\u2019s just a level setting based on historic data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And one of your peers noted in a call yesterday, that they were comfortable going below their regulatory minimum of 10.5% to serve its clients. And I\u2019m wondering what Citi\u2019s stance is ongoing below that 10% bright line, especially since that\u2019s where the automatic distributions on dividend and other payouts kick in?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, why don\u2019t I start, Mike or?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know look, I think our view is, we are clearly living in an uncertain period of time. The crisis we\u2019re facing is unprecedented. And you know, if I think about our objectives, you know, primary objective ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees, second to that or an addition to that ensuring that we are positioned to serve our clients, our customers and to play an important role in stabilizing the economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so when I think about the combination of those things, we want to be there for our clients. And I think we\u2019re expected to be there for our clients in a period like this. And you\u2019ve seen our CET1 ratio dropped to 11.2% this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve, we\u2019re going to be there for them and that means that our ratio takes more pressure than we\u2019ll manage through that. If we were to drop you know, below the 10% that you referenced, there\u2019s still plenty of room between that and the use of the buffer that the - you know, that the regulators have authorized. And so we\u2019re managing it thoughtfully, diligently but in the context of those priorities that I mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. How are you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Betsy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Betsy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Question on \u2013 as it relates to the use of that capital part of it is coming from the drawdowns and I wanted to understand how you think your clients are going to be using those drawdowns. Do you expect them to persist for you know, many quarters, many years or do you think that you know, we will, over the next 12 months see some pay down of that through terming out in the capital markets and maybe also give us a sense as to the associated deposits, how much of the drawdowns came back into you know, your liquidity via the deposits and persistency there as well would be helpful? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so Betsy I would say kind of looking at the numbers, we had roughly right around about $30 billion, $32 billion worth of draws in the first quarter, so somewhere 10% or 11%, 12% of our outstanding, but unfunded. So I wouldn\u2019t call that an overly meaningful number. And I think going back to my earlier comment to Glenn, I think that the extraordinary actions taken in the CP facilities in terms of some of the corporate facilities, some of the SBA or probably more likely the main street lending facilities alleviates a lot of that pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we saw two things there, there were clearly those industries that were under stress and those were pretty easily identifiable along the list that Mark had described. And then I think there were those that just believed that it was a good time to bring in liquidity. And I think as the Fed programs and the Treasury programs came into place, the bond markets reopened, you saw record issuance of debt in the late first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, when you look at our portfolio, it\u2019s predominantly an investment grade portfolio and that investment grade portfolio in times with those programs in place has access to the capital markets. And so we saw people shift there. Obviously something we were paying attention to. We\u2019re in constant dialogue with our clients. But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, we\u2019ve actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we don\u2019t see or feel that pressure right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then on the deposit side, can you give us a sense as to, you know, the percentage of the draws that went into deposits and how you think about the persistency of those deposits as well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah let me comment a little bit more broadly on the deposits. So you know, the ICG deposits that we saw come in the month of March, we\u2019re about $92 billion our deposits grew pretty significantly just in the month of March. And if I break that down about a third of that were from corporate clients that built liquidity through draws or issuance. And it\u2019s not you know, necessarily just liquidity you know, just draws from us, but about a third of it, we would attribute as being tied towards that increase in liquidity draws or issuances that they\u2019ve done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">About a third were from brokered dealers and clearing houses and financial institutions as they bolstered kind of their liquidity buffers. And then a third were from investor clients derisking and moving to cash. And so that gives you a little bit of a sense for a mix. We obviously look at the persistency of the deposits and you know, some of those are certainly operating deposits. And I think part of what will inform the view to some extent is, as Mike described you know, the additional you know, channels that are now available for clients to access additional liquidity as needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But also how long this persist and there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty as you\u2019ve heard us reference as to how long you know, this crisis we\u2019re managing through persists. So hopefully it gives you a sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And you know, the fact that the drawdowns have slowed dramatically you know, de minimis in your words, Mike, the pressure, I would expect going forward on CET1 is going to you know, pull back as well. So maybe you could give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about that? And then you know, in the context of that how you\u2019re thinking about the dividend? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So you know, I think as Mark described, the way you know, we thought about, you saw us kind of put a balance sheet to use and you saw the CET1 move from the 11.8% to the 11.2%, clearly leaving us lots of room, lots of buffer. And again, we\u2019re early in this, you know, we don\u2019t know and where this will go, but our gut or how we\u2019re thinking about this is \u2013 this recovery is going to be uneven.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that as a team, we\u2019ve pretty well discounted, a uniform V-shaped recovery. The question, is it U-shaped? Is it W-shaped or parts of it L-shaped? And I think we want to retain a lot of flexibility and capacity to be able to step into the situations that count. And again I think as we said that, if there\u2019s two roles, one is, how do we use our own balance sheet? And then how do we actually use and bring to life a lot of these programs and continue programs that have been put out there by the Fed and the Treasury.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in the right situations, we\u2019re prepared to let that ratio go down. We\u2019re in conversations with our board. We are in conversations with our regulator and I think Mark said you know, we feel that we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend, but again, we\u2019re going to treat that as a time when it comes. But you know, to be clear, in our capacity here and the way we\u2019re looking at things you know, we remained committed to paying our dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. A couple of more questions on the card business if you don\u2019t mind. So if you kind of separate the branded cards from the retail services and just can you help us talk about just what you\u2019re seeing \u2013 you know, relatively speaking in terms of we can see it in the rate of change that happened in the first quarter, but would you expect divergence in either spending trends, volume balances and credit as this evolves or any color you can help us with there? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, I don\u2019t \u2013 why don\u2019t I start just in terms of the spend. And so you know in the quarter if I think about kind of the last week of March, the card spend activity you know, just broadly for us was down about 30% US spend, you know, by category down total of 30%. The big you know, categories, if you will, impact it are not going to be of any surprise to you travel down 75%, dining and entertainment down some 60% you know, discretionary retail which would include you know, apparel, the department stores, et cetera, down 50% you know, essentials were up 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, as you would \u2013 as I think you would expect and again, that got us to a total of down about 30% in just the last week. We all have seen what has continued to happen over the past couple of weeks. And so, I would expect, we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter, in light of the way this is persisting, and that you know, should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes in which we expect to see some top line pressure there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, similarly as you referenced that we have a large retail services business and we have partner clients who we advise in that regard and we\u2019ve been working with them to help drive sales digitally. But obviously the shutdown in most of the economy and the stay at home orders as well as the temporary store closures across most of the country will certainly impact our partners and our results, including a slowdown in new customer acquisitions as well as again, a lower purchase sales volumes \u2013 volume through you know, through that part of our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, that said you know, we\u2019ve got a number of partners who do operate or a large partner I should say who do operate you know as essential resources to you know, to the economy and while they\u2019ll have lower store traffic, they will be able to continue to kind of serve. And ultimately you know, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in NCLs subject to, of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, and thank you and just a follow-up and you know, should and if you know balances come down, just given that card is such a bigger part of your balance sheet. This \u2013 is there a positive offset that comes through with regards to the reserving needs. Just wondering how cards specifically for you guys in that in and out with regards to you know, spend and outstandings informs how the ins and outs of card reserve builds? If that\u2019s a fair question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. So I mean, if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter, there are number of factors that come into play, you know, so your probability of recession, your severity of recession, our view on the important economic variables and how they\u2019re going to play out as well as balances. And so, as the balances you know, shift and the mix and makeup of those balances shift, that\u2019s going to have an impact on what we would expect in the way of those lifetime losses and therefore, what we would expect in a way of how that reserve balance would move.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. So in the US there\u2019s obviously a lot of efforts underway that kind of soften the blow to the consumer as we think about credit losses, there\u2019s the fiscal health, there\u2019s payment deferrals. Maybe you could just talk about kind of what\u2019s going on in Mexico and Asia and some of your bigger markets there in terms of you know things that might soften the blow for the consumer. And you know is that as meaningful as kind of what we\u2019re seeing here? Or how do you factor that into your thought process on potential losses?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, Matt, I think that\u2019s a great question. And I think as you think about it as, we think about all the places we come to work, I think we\u2019ve got to use a series of lenses to really look at where these countries and these economies are, I would say, one is that you\u2019ve got to look first at the health crisis response. Have the government\u2019s taking it seriously? Have they put measures? Have they put social distancing? Have they put stay in place types of things and what\u2019s the trajectory of that look like?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the second piece is around what you see in terms of both monetary and fiscal response. And not just what\u2019s been to-date, but what\u2019s been the capacity of those economies to be able to implement those and more things, potentially into the future. And I think the third important piece that we look at is the underlying demographics of the economy as an example, do they have big exposures or are they dependent on oil exports or other commodities or other types of things where there\u2019s concentrations around that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I would say that that it\u2019s not by region, it is really and we are taking really a country-by-country approach to what that is. And I think you\u2019ve seen it all over the map in terms of very strong responses out of the US, out of Japan. You\u2019ve seen some responses out of Europe and I think you\u2019ve seen some of those that are slower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In particular, to your question on Mexico is, we know the President has labeled himself a fiscal hawk and I think he has been reluctant to use any type of outsized spending to go at this crisis to-date. And obviously we\u2019re watching that carefully. We\u2019ve tried to be pretty prudent in terms of our credit standards there and the things that we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re obviously watching it closely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just want to follow-up on that. I mean remind us, I think your targeted customer base in Mexico you know, is much higher than I would say, the broad-based customers. So maybe just remind us about some of the credit metrics in the card portfolio in Mexico specifically? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mark, do you want to \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have the credit metrics available. What I would say is that, you know, while we do appeal to the broader population there, we do tend to focus on the higher and certainly relative to our peer players in that Mexico market. And so, we do skew to the higher end in terms of the credit profile. They have a different system and the FICO system per se.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we actually have been you know, very closely monitoring as you\u2019ve seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have, in fact, trended lower than that of the broader industry as we\u2019ve you know, been and quite vigilant about focus and staying inside of our risk parameters, which again, do skew higher than most of the peers in that country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry if I missed part of this. In terms of additional reserve builds ahead, another $5 billion in the second or third quarter. Yes, no, maybe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Mike. Let me make a couple of comments to that. One, you know, again, a lot of uncertainty here dealing with a significant crisis as you well know. Even as we have closed out this quarter, the variables you know, that we look at continue to shift you know, meaningfully. I would expect that you know, with that as a backdrop, and again, subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there, so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s kind of where we are. I mean I \u2013 I\u2019m not going to you know, we\u2019ve got the rest of the quarter to play out. We\u2019ve got you know, analysis and models that we have to do. We have you know, consumers that have to respond to much of the stimulus that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve got to understand how it continues to impact the different businesses that we\u2019re in. it\u2019s way too early to give you any sense for what that number is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And what lessons have you learned from Asia? I mean, the virus was there first. You should have a little more of a head start than other banks that don\u2019t have that experience and what are you seeing in terms of you know, volumes and credit losses and your ability to work with the clients?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so I think that \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Go ahead, Mike sorry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that you know, in some ways, Mike, we you know, if you want to call it that have been fortunate to have lived that. And I think you know, we took a lot of lessons and I think you saw in our actions in terms of the moves we took in terms of getting people \u2013 remotely getting people home of the types of client engagement. And I would say, less than one that we\u2019re watching very closely is the resurgence of cases as people start to come back in. And so I think we\u2019ve got to be very mindful about how and when or when and how we, in fact, do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You saw us in very early March go, I think is the first US bank to go out and engage around in particular, our consumer customers in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged. And I think to Mark\u2019s point and you can see it in the credit numbers that so far relatively benign and we\u2019ve been putting programs in place in most, if not all of our Asian countries in terms of similar types of forbearance programs and really trying to engage around that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s early, but again you could \u2013 you can see the numbers that would probably 60 days in or so that we probably had a reasonably full February and March in terms of COVID in terms of Asia, but you know, again we\u2019re watching the numbers closely, but it\u2019s around the engagement and the programs and you know, some of it was dusting off the playbooks from \u201808 and in some of the things in between.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I can just follow-up. You talked about the resurgence of cases and people come back in, in Asia. I mean are your employees coming back yet? Are you seeing this or is this just third-party you know, medical advice that you\u2019re receiving? Are you seeing this firsthand? And when do you plan to open Asia back up? You know, in Citi Asia? I mean, how many people are working remote? How many people are in the office?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, you may have missed it. But we talked a little bit earlier, Mike in terms of the unevenness of this, that when you think of this virus that you know, it\u2019s not only uneven in terms of pacing in terms of where we are in the world, we\u2019ve got at least a two to three span just in the United States in terms of where the virus is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you know, within Asia you know, we\u2019ve seen probably the most concerted efforts to get people back in in terms of China and I would say, we are largely back there. I think the last numbers I looked at as of yesterday, we were about two-thirds back in terms of Hong Kong and I would say, most of the rest of the region at lower levels than that. And so we\u2019re taking a very specific or very site-by-site view in terms of how we bring people back.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, you know, first criteria is where is the virus in its trajectory? Second criteria is, what are the things that happen at a site that are very difficult to replicate in a remote environment? And then in terms of addressing that, what\u2019s the safest way we can begin to bring people back? So that I think that \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But that\u2019s pretty remarkable two-thirds back in Hong Kong. So that\u2019s you know, cautiously optimistic for what\u2019s ahead here or don\u2019t read too much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, I think it\u2019s place-by-place so I think we\u2019ve you know, we\u2019re taking a kind of a site-by-site and \u2013 but at the same time you know, understanding again, you probably missed this part of it, you know, we\u2019re absolutely open for business. We\u2019re just working differently, right. If you look at the things that we\u2019ve accomplished just in the month of March, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not at work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, as an example, yesterday you know, we had over 180,000 people accessing our systems remotely at one time our peak search was 132,000 of those people on simultaneously. You think about the things that have accomplished Mark and his finance team, you know, closed the quarter on a $2 trillion balance sheet. You look at this submission of CCAR, you look at all the things that remediation efforts, the small business programs, all being applied remotely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, it\u2019s going to be bespoke in terms of how we do it, as Mark said, with an eye towards making sure we keep our people safe. And at the same time doing everything we can do to service our customers and clients through this extraordinary time. And it\u2019s going to be case-by-case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Hey, good morning guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Saul. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of CECL questions, so please bear with me. But you know, first I want to get your perspective on the DFAST stress losses and whether you think it\u2019s a good reference point to judge reserve adequacy under CECL, because we do get a lot of questions asking why allowance level are so much below, what the nine quarter stress losses are in the severely adverse scenario in the adversary. And I think that\u2019s true for you guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you know, my personal view is that, DFAST is a useful data point, but that there are fundamental differences you know, obviously beyond the differences in the economic scenarios used. The point of DFAST is to estimate loss absorbing capacity in a severe downturn. And maybe estimates are going to be on the conservative end of losses where as under CECL, like these are point in time estimates that you\u2019re \u2013 are your best guesses of what your losses will be over the life of the loans under an economic scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, let alone the lot of methodological differences in terms of how you calculate those things in terms of things like you know, weighted average remaining life or whatever it is. But I\u2019m curious if you have a perspective and whether you think you know, there \u2013 the stress losses should be sort of a reference point or you know, or how useful they are to measure whether you know, a given bank or your bank has adequate reserves?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, I think you said a lot there. I think that it is a reference point, I think you\u2019ve highlighted you know, some meaningful differences in the approaches and perspectives everything from you know, the modeling, the assumptions like et cetera, et cetera. And so I think it does serve as a reference point. But I think what we\u2019re experiencing now and even as we submitted a plan from a CCAR point of view, is that you know, that\u2019s a scenario. It certainly is a stress scenario, but we\u2019re now living through a real life stress situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think you know, that scenario is meant to \u2013 those scenarios are meant to inform you know, a firm\u2019s ability to withstand stress, but we\u2019ve got a real test here that has put us and I think the industry in a position where we are constantly you know, modeling and demonstrating our ability to withstand real-time pressures and the prospect of real life losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now with that said, you know, CECL, you know, a new approach I think that the timing is interesting in that we get to see a \u2013 we see a meaningful shift between transition and day one, which I would think in a normal environment, you wouldn\u2019t see that type of dramatic shift. But again you know, that\u2019s informed by you know, a view \u2013 a forward looking view of what is now a crisis in a stressed environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so that magnitude of the change that we see in the day two is a direct byproduct of that. And I think what we\u2019ll see is, that continues to you know, that what we do in the way of forward reserves will continue to be informed by that. And what we ultimately experienced in losses, however, will be informed by how much of the uncertainty that I talked to plays out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, no stress scenario that\u2019s been created you know, thus far you know, would have contemplated the amount of fiscal response and monetary response that we\u2019ve seen in short order. You know and so that\u2019s not modeled and how customers or consumers react to that is not part of any CCAR DFAST model that we would have run. How that offsets the impact of you know, unemployment or ultimately losses is completely unclear. And so, there\u2019s a fair amount, you know, yes, it\u2019s a data point you know, but there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty and now differences I would expect in light of now managing through a real life scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. If I can follow-up, you guys use one scenario, most large banks use these multiple scenarios in calculating their reserves. But \u2013 sorry if I missed this, but can you just outline you know that the sort of big picture, some of the big picture assumptions you\u2019re using whether it\u2019s you know, global growth or US growth or unemployment that underlie that scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I guess it\u2019s sort of an adjunct to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Does using one scenario create more volatility, because if you\u2019re using the scenario analysis you know, you can kind of calibrate between different outcomes, whereas it\u2019s more of a a big change if you change your outlook, it\u2019s just one scenario to another in your case as opposed to maybe a grade of different outcomes if you were to use sort of a weighted average scenario analysis that most banks use. So does it \u2013 do you think it creates more volatility and more jumps and releases than you otherwise would have?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so we do use a model approach, where we use a scenario, but what I would say is that, that scenario was informed by kind of a further management adjustment and the factors that are considered are not only thousands of variables like GDP and unemployment and many, many, many other stats given the nature of the business that we do, but also the probability of recession and the severity of the recession and we can toggle in our management adjustment degrees of severity that we would expect in a recession, whether that\u2019s 25%, 50%, 75% and a 100% in terms of the severity relative to an \u201808 recession or whatever the case might be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, while we do use a model and one scenario, there is flex there, if you will, in terms of ensuring that we capture what we think best reflects the forward view of the economic outlook in our analysis. And in terms of as we \u2013 as I may have mentioned \u2013 I think I mentioned earlier at some point you\u2019ve got to put a stake in the ground at the end of the quarter and look at the assumptions that we have to work with in terms of those thousands of variables and certainly the key ones that I mentioned. And this quarter in particular, we\u2019ve seen things continue to move and so even the view that we would have taken at the end of the quarter around many of those metrics \u2013 the outlook on them have been \u2013 has continued to shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we find ourselves running various scenarios to understand the impact on our ratios and on our estimated losses, including ranges of unemployment from 10% to 15% and GDP declines from 20% to 40% we\u2019re constantly kind of running those scenarios to understand the implications on our CET1 ratio and other important metrics that are required to properly run and manage and plan at the firm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Saul Martinez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks. Mark, just quick question first on the ICG and the reserve coverage there. I hear that you said that you\u2019re comfortable with it. When you kind of look at the reserve that you have against the total exposures. It\u2019s about an 80 basis points against all the exposures, but yeah, you\u2019re looking at non-investment grade being 21% of the portfolio. So what kind of metrics are you keying on to get comfort there? It doesn\u2019t seem like it takes a large amount of delinquencies also and have a large increase in losses?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, look we\u2019ve got, there are series of metrics that we use in the case of the ICG, GDP is an important metric, obviously a view on downgrades is an important metric, a view on energy prices, oil prices is an important metric and as you \u2013 we don\u2019t have the entire portfolio parsed here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But that 81 basis points is going to be a mix of where we feel as though we need to have more \u2013more reserves and so one example is that when we built additional reserves and you can look at kind of our reserve ratio for the energy sector for example and that\u2019s closer to 2%, 2.1% in terms of the funded reserve ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, I highlight that as just a simple example of obviously there going to be some higher, some lower and in terms of the broader non-investment grade similar to that example, I just gave you, the broader non-investment grade bucket is closer to 2% in terms of the reserve ratio. So, again, I can understand the question given the 81 basis points, but we are \u2013 obviously are using good judgment as we look through the different risk profile of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Kleinhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then with regards to the guidance that you\u2019re giving about how March and April could trend out to the rest of the quarter, I mean, is there any given update on kind of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry if you gave it already, but how purchase sales were trending in April and how the revenues in TTS were trending in April. I mean, you said March they were down 9% in TTS, is that gotten worse in April? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Mason</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I don\u2019t have the spend activity at hand. If I look here for April. I\u2019m not sure if you call it, I said earlier, but the card spend activity towards the end of March, the last week in March has been around 30%, down 30% with a mix across the difference across the differences in the different categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of TTS, again, I don\u2019t have the April stats, we did see kind of pressure in the month of March and what I was referencing there was the rate pressure playing through in terms of commercial card activity just as another proxy for spend similar to the retail card or consumer card spend levels that was down pretty meaningfully, which says a lot about our corporate client base in terms of T&amp;E, commercial card spend was down almost 60% and kind of B2B, business-to-business, commercial card activity was down some 19% in the month of March.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, but likely those trends continue. However, I would kind of just note that we continue to see very good engagement with our TTS client base and we see that in the higher volumes that we saw in Q1, we expect as that will continue, we see that in the new accounts that we\u2019re opening with them, we would expect that to continue, including utilizing many of our digital capabilities there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And frankly, as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with, we would expect that we\u2019re going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like. And so the metrics will move, the top line will move in light of the rate environment, but I think those underlying drivers, if you will, say a lot about what the future prospects are for the firm here. Mike, you want to comment on \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mike Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I can just quickly, Mark before we close out here. I just want to go back to Mike\u2019s question and apologize for having flipped my numbers. We\u2019ve got globally over 80% of our staff working remotely and the number in Hong Kong is that we\u2019ve got about a third back and two-thirds still working remotely. So Mike, I apologize for getting that one inverted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator with that, I think that concludes the call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for today \u2013</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elizabeth Lynn</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you all for joining us today.
