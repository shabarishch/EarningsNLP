Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.</p> <p>We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.

On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p> <p>Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Michael Corbat</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016, or $1.24 per share. These results are a significant improvement from the first quarter not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets were winding down in Citi Holdings.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The results also show our institution\u2019s ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, and utilized additional deferred tax assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets, and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan which was just approved significant increases to the amount of capital we\u2019ll return over the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our institutional franchise, both our markets and investment banking businesses are rebounding client activity from the last quarter. And our treasury and trade solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates in support of our clients\u2019 needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In global consumer banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we\u2019ve been investing in our U.S. branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines, and in retail services, we\u2019re renewing our partnership with the Home Depot. We\u2019re excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from one year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup\u2019s total earnings for the quarter. We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While our remaining DTA does hamper, our return on tangible common equity utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately $30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last four quarters. Even so, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time and earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted. And as a result, we\u2019ll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next four quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan shows the progress we continue to make to becoming a safer and stronger institution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We\u2019re continuing to navigate the consequences of the UK referendum on the EU from its economic impact to how exactly it will structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the UK has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn\u2019t create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019ve navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there has been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we\u2019re seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And while we don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming \u2013 what will come in the months as we look forward, we\u2019re always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources. And I believe, we\u2019re very well-positioned from the capital, liquidity, and capacity perspective. John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. John?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Gerspach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, but expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We earned $4 billion in the second quarter, or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to $938 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp is the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp other.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pre-tax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year, but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and the lower cost in credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Citi Holdings, both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year, as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets, or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results from North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially, but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9% respectively from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs in our existing portfolio, as well as higher payment rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we\u2019re making in our core products. In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to-date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly two-thirds being out of store, and the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size had already grown to a $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Costco is a great partner and we\u2019re excited about the potential for this business. We\u2019re also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct-mail, e-mail, phone and Admiral\u2019s Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality growing portfolio and attractive returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impact of the renewal should lower pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pre-tax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond, as certain additional revenue sharing arrangements become effective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, turning to retail services, revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter, as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot. We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year, as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, credit cards in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve building branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second-half of 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe, we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second-half of 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower return mortgage loans, as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by 3% growth in personal loans as you can see on the lower right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second-half of the year with continued growth in higher return personal loans, and therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second-half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans, and revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Asia, as I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year, as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia. In response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover, as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields. But combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which have seen slower overall market activity relative to last year. And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with a sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year with revenue growth to follow thereafter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rates in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trend. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second-half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 10, we show the year over year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis. As you can see, the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second-half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter, and the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our expense growth in the first-half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise, as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter, and credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable with the net loss rate declining year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11, revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by fixed income and treasury and trade solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products, such as U.S. dollar clearing, as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world. We\u2019re seeing the demand for our services increase, as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment, at the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions, as well as our wallet share in all major products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Private bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And corporate lending revenues of $389 million were down 18%, as higher loan volumes were more than offset \u2013 more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates in currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the days following the UK referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our treasury and trade solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our fixed income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery particularly in securitized products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to equities, excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity, as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, in security services, revenues declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year, but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly two-thirds offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to non-accrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The cost of credit related to energy was minimal, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices, as well as increased capital markets activity. Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvements in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back-half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first-half growth, although modest in our accrual and transaction services businesses, despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in treasury and trade solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in fixed income and equities, but remain down year-over-year in investment banking, given lower overall market activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain disciplined in our core expense management, as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first-half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements, and of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 13 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year, as well as the lower debt buyback activity, and expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 14, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM, and lower low yields. Looking to the second-half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco, as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields, as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In consumer banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the institutional business, we expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while investment banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our treasury and trade solutions business, as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients day-to-day banking needs around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp other revenues are expected to be close to zero, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at break-even for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that Mike and I are happy to answer any questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good afternoon guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Jim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a question on the energy credit, you \u2013 I think you said in June around $1.2 billion of, I think, energy-related credit costs. I think if I my math is right, you did about $500 million year-to-date, and now you\u2019re seeing $300 million to $500 million in the second-half, is that right? So, 8 \u2013 is that kind of way to think about $800 million to $1 billion right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the $1.2 billion, Jim, that was our reference to total Citi \u2013 total ICG cost of credit, that was not specific to energy\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, fair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">...at that point in time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So is \u2013 it does seem like it\u2019s a little bit of a step-down versus expectations even\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, certainly \u2013 it certainly, when you take a look at the first-half, which you know is about $500 million cost of credit in ICG. And with the second-half range of $300 million to $500 million, that gives you your comparison of $800 million to $1 billion against the previous $1.2 billion. So, yes, it is a step-down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And is that just simply the improvement in the capital markets in what you\u2019re seeing in terms of experience with the energy space and then getting capital, is that the big change, or is it oil prices or just the combination of both?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it\u2019s a combination of both. And certainly, we\u2019re benefiting \u2013 that outlook benefits from what we\u2019re seeing as a stabilization of energy cost with oil in that $45 barrel range. So I think, it also reflects the overall resiliency in our credit portfolio, which is what we\u2019ve been talking about. Now, we described to you the quality of our energy exposure in the past. First quarter, even in the first quarter, we said 73% of our energy exposure was to investment-grade names that has continued to remain at 73% in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The funded loan book at the first quarter was 63% investment grade, that\u2019s actually improved now to 65%. And because we\u2019re concentrated in those high-quality names, they do have access to capital markets and therefore are able to strengthen their balance sheets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. An E&amp;P balances were down too. So, okay\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I mean, when you take a look at what we\u2019ve been able to do, we traded off. We reduced the high risk portfolio and remained more concentrated in the high-quality portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. Maybe just one follow-up on Costco, it seems like it\u2019s off to a pretty good start. You\u2019re obviously going to be building reserves there. Do you expect it to be added to the earnings, neutral to earnings, as we think about the combination of expenses, revenues, and provision build?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jim, our view going into the acquisition is that, in this first year in 2016, it would likely be neutral to earnings just because of the mechanics behind the reserve build. And so that\u2019s our view right now. We\u2019ll give you more updates as to how it could impact 2017, certainly as we get later in the year. But for now, I\u2019d say 2016 on EBT point of view is basically neutral.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">James Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So still sticking to neutral. Okay, thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Jim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Glenn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hello there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Glenn, can you speak up a little bit. We really can\u2019t hear you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Really? I\u2019m screaming into it, sorry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No problem, no problem. In cards, when I take a step back and I look at all the either renewal up rates or the acquisition costs, like cards is a super tough business right now, or I should say super competitive business right now. So I heard your comments about the 250 basis point ROA on the retail partner. Could you maybe talk about where the cards overall ROA and RoTCE is now and where it should be going forward, it kind of follows on, on Jim\u2019s question. I just like \u2013 just want to make sure we\u2019re growing profitability here and not just volume, important business for you guys?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, again, as we\u2019ve said, longer-term we \u2013 our view is from a branded cards portfolio, we want to be running that portfolio at about 225 to 235 basis points, which really is consistent with where we were entering into the crisis. So, what you\u2019ve seen through the crisis is a \u2013 an impact on ROA first with a severe downturn in ROA, as everybody built reserves and worked their way through the credit issues and then coming out now we\u2019ve all benefited from reserve releases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So today, where we were getting ROA in branded cards something close to 300 basis points, but a lot of that has been fueled by reserve releases. The business that we\u2019re building in branded cards is one that is set to yield in ROA of 225 to 235 basis points, where we were going into the crisis and with a better more higher quality book of business. And it\u2019s the same story with retail services that 250 basis points is what we think is a realistic long-term return with that business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, I appreciate that. You mentioned the renewal on American, most of the channels, I saw that Barclays had gotten, I think, it was the airports and on the plane, which I\u2019m not sure what that means. But what percentage of the originations in the past came from those channels, like do I care?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I mean, it certainly is a smaller amount of the originations than what we believe that we are going to be able to achieve through the channels that we retain. The on-airline and in-airport the \u2013 I\u2019d call it the travel day type of acquisitions, that was not a particular strength of ours anyway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, I appreciate that. One last one on, which one to choose? Okay, I saw the commentary on the more preferreds coming. With capital and leverage ratios so strong, like really strong and a payout ratio still at 70%, I\u2019m just curious where the incremental preferreds \u2013 what\u2019s their purpose, where they are going and why do you need them?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Glenn, maybe I misspoke or \u2013 but we\u2019re not signaling that we are issuing more preferreds. We\u2019ve done our preferred issuance for now, given the capital stack that we have right now, our preferreds are where they are. But that did since we now are settled for a couple of quarters you\u2019re going to see the preferred dividend than increase over where they were prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, no problem, I got it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if you take a look at Slide 32, that just sort of, we just want to level set your expectations as to where preferred dividends will be reflected. But all these preferred dividends reflect issuances already done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Totally appreciate it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Glenn. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bye, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. As Mike noted, the earnings came in nicely better than the first quarter. Just wondering, John, what are some of the items that got better since the early June guidance that earnings looked kind of flattish with the first quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d say several things improved, John. Clearly, the markets \u2013 markets revenues were improved. What we found is during the month of June, we were able to engage with our corporate clients. They were seeking advice as to how to handle a volatility, both leading up to the UK referendum and then certainly subsequent to the UK referendum and that that gave us a great opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But at the same point in time, because the capital markets remained open during the month of June, we did benefit from a lot of our energy clients then being able to access the client, so that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference at the early part of June.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, we saw improved momentum in Mexico in the retail bank during the month of June. We noted that overall consumer revenues in Mexico grew 4% year-over-year that was higher than what we had thought that was going to be when Mike spoke. So we had momentum building in Mexico. We had good engagement with clients throughout the whole UK referendum. And then we benefited from the lower cost of credit again because of the high-quality of our book.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And you mentioned the corporate credit getting better and you gave an outlook for the cost of credit for ICG looking ahead. How should we think, John, about the provision trend in cards and overall consumer going forward from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, again, that\u2019s going to intend to increase for two reasons. One is, as we build additional ANR and we\u2019re definitely in a growth mode when it comes to our card \u2013 our branded cards book. We\u2019re going to meet to build reserves just because of the volume. And then with Costco, again, when you get into purchase accounting, you\u2019ve got a heavy front-end build on LLR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just one final thing on Costco, as you mentioned, that\u2019s starting to grow and you\u2019re getting the accounts. There have been some press stories and anecdotal reports of difficulties in the initial roll out. Were there some operational snafus that occurred? Have they been fixed and is everything running right now? Could you just give us an update on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, it\u2019s Mike. I would say that we experienced extremely high calling volumes in the early implementation of it. We\u2019ve put a lot of resources at it, questions around card activation, questions around statements, questions around where to send payments. And so we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re gaining on it. We\u2019re very focused on it. We\u2019ve got a lot of resources deployed against it and it\u2019s something we can fix in the short order.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. But you did mention John that the accounts are growing, sign-ups have been good?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s definitely are growing. I mean 330,000 new card acquisitions just since we took over the book that far exceeded our expectations by a factor of 2 and 2.5 times. So, again, we\u2019re really excited about. I think it speaks to the quality of the value proposition that that we put forward with that card in partnership with Costco.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So just dealing with the volume operationally is what you\u2019re still working through?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, again, as Mike mentioned, the call wait times are coming down, but it\u2019s, yes, it\u2019s probably it\u2019s not the largest, it\u2019s got to be one of the largest portfolio implementation transfers on a single day that\u2019s ever been attempted. And that\u2019s not to give us excuses, I mean, we should be performing better than we are, but we\u2019re working on that. But again, it\u2019s a massive program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McDonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Brennan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On card another one here, the velocity in North America has been really, really good in both purchase volume and ANR. How long should we think about that sustaining and given some of the deals you\u2019ve just walked down from a modeling perspective how long can that sustain?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, that\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t anticipate the same level now. You\u2019ve got two things, two factors. One is Costco obviously is going to benefit as now for the next year, so we\u2019re going to get a tremendous pickup from Costco. As in Costco though, we will begin on an ex-Costco basis some of that growth and we have 10% growth this quarter in purchase sales year-over-year, excluding Costco. That will begin to moderate sometime around towards the end of this year, the beginning of next year. But, again, we still anticipate getting good volume growth, but you\u2019re not going to get the same bump that you have when you start an investment program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Okay, thanks. We also recently heard about some of your competitors widening out their credit box in card in recent years. Have you guys done that too? Have we seen a shift down within the Citi portfolio a bit of an expansion as far as credit, or can you maybe give a little color on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re still focused on the same target client that we had going in. If we moved by a basis point or two in FICO, that\u2019s about it. But when you take a look at where we\u2019re focused right now, it\u2019s still on that same target clients that I described to you in the past. And with the renewals that we\u2019ve done and with the new partnership with Costco, I think that speaks to the type of clients that we\u2019re really looking to build on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Terrific. Just wanted to make sure. And then last one from me, the card trends in Asia, I appreciate your comments on the lower rewards in Australia. But when we look at the loan balances, it doesn\u2019t look like Australia is really all that big. Can that really move the needle? Can you help us understand how that would actually drive that those metrics?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, again, it\u2019s not going to drive in this quarter in ANR, but it is going to drive purchase sale. So we have a lot of usage coming out of Australia. So the drop-down in Australia itself cost us a full percentage point on purchase sale growth year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then that will probably just sustain for a year that lower volume, because it sounds like that\u2019s probably pretty structural, given the changes in that market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, what I would actually think is that as the other card issuers in Asia also adjust their rewards programs, what you\u2019ll see is less of an impact where people stop using their Citi Card. And as the programs become more consistent and more competitive with each other, we should get a pickup back again. So I don\u2019t think that this is more than a one or two quarter blip down in purchase sale growth in Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And have you seen competitors move yet or just you\u2019re just anticipating it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have anything particular in front of me that that would indicate what we\u2019ve seen yet on behavior. We\u2019ll get back to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sounds good.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. John, you touched on Mexico earlier, but can you talk about Mexico or more generally where do you see it in its profit cycle in addition to just consumer what you said is improving. And then a question for Mike, under what circumstances would you consider a sale of Mexico? I know that that\u2019s in the past, but your discount tangible book keep getting steeper and steeper especially as your tangible book value continues to cost?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to handle the first part of that question, Mike, there we were seeing good momentum throughout our Mexico franchise. We\u2019ve actually had great momentum in our ICG business in Mexico throughout the past year, year-and-a-half. It\u2019s consumer where we had a bit of a slowdown in that momentum, which we\u2019re now working our way out of, which is why we find getting 4% year-over-year revenue growth to be a nice start positive operating leverage this quarter, positive operating leverage in the back-half of this year. We anticipate having positive operating leverage coming out of the consumer business in Mexico straight on through 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019ve got an improving cards picture. We\u2019ve got a vibrant retail banking picture going on in Mexico. So we see that as an engine for growth out into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And, Mike, from the strategic perspective, it really dovetails off of what John just described we like \u2013 as we have talked about. We like the demographics of Mexico, the growth prospects, where they are now post reforms. The position of Banamex in terms of its retail and consumer franchise, the scale of that our ability to compete. And so in a world that we see, at least, for the future ahead of us right now growth in the world\u2019s are pretty tough thing to find. We think Mexico offers that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So based on what we see and what we think the opportunities are in the franchise, we think it\u2019s accretive to our shareholders. The return are solid, and we think we\u2019ve got the ability to continue to expand those. So right now, I really don\u2019t see a scenario, where we would contemplate selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The spirit behind the question and I know you, you understand this. I mean tangible book is close to 64 and the stock price is $44, and at some point the best investment is buying back your own stock. And but you created asset sale gains to, be allowed to buyback more stock, it\u2019s not something you should consider and you\u2019ve made a lot of strides. You discard many consumer operations outside the U.S. You reduced the size of Citi Holdings. Can\u2019t you reaccelerate some of that restructuring?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, if you look we just announced a pretty meaningful capital return. We\u2019re in the market and we\u2019ll be buying back $8.6 billion worth of stock over the next four quarters. As you look at our math and you look at our capital return capacity, we\u2019re going to have a lot of ability to buy stock back.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when you think about the trade-offs between the stock buyback and growth, you\u2019ve got to find the right balance. So, again, if we can execute on the things that we want to execute, create the earnings, continue to liberate the DTA, we\u2019re going to have a lot of firepower against the stock, and I\u2019d like to keep investing and making sure, we\u2019re finding and continuing to build on growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So because of your capital excess in both CET1 and SLR, your name keeps coming up as someone that can continue to take market share, particularly in ICG. And I\u2019m wondering if there are limitations on growth or balance sheet allocation that we\u2019re not thinking about. And I guess the real question here is, where are you in terms of your scoring range on your GCIB surcharge? And is keeping your surcharge where it is today a bigger priority than potentially growing the balance sheet in a greater way to gain market share, given how volatile that that score can be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great question, Erika. And one that we contemplate every day. There\u2019s a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against, GCIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1 stress test capital call that CCAR capital, there\u2019s just many and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s a constant trade-off, but the GCIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we\u2019re making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year we work to get there. And we ended the year now, I\u2019d say in the very high end of that score range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one of our goal is to remain in a 3% GCIB in a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so, we\u2019re actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you\u2019re right, those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GCIB score, we come out right at 630. So we\u2019re right in that range of where we need to be and we\u2019re going to keep on working to make sure that we end the year below that 630 target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And just a follow-up question on the margin appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the puts and takes of Costco for the next \u2013 for the second-half of the year. If the slope of the curve persists or there\u2019s continued pressure on the long end, how should we think about how the marginal progress from that 290 level?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One more weighted especially short-term to the short end of the curve. What we\u2019ve told you in the past is, if the rates move by a 100 basis points, we\u2019ll generate an additional around the world of $1.9 billion of additional net interest income. And most of that $1.9 billion will be concentrated in the U.S. which is I think about a $1.4 billion. And most of that $1.4 billion is focused on the short end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the long end of the curve, especially in the near-term the next year, year-and-a-half doesn\u2019t really impact us all that much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Erika Najarian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. No problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot. John, we saw a progress this quarter in the efficiency ratio as you mentioned. And I was just wondering is the prior comments you had made about 58% in Corp for the year still relevant, given the trends that we\u2019ve seen, or is there anything that kind of coming out of the second quarter with the 57 that makes you feel any better about the second-half, I know there\u2019s some seasonality?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I feel pretty good about the second-half. But what we had said at the end of the first quarter is that our target would be to do 58% efficiency for the full-year, given what we \u2013 the given the first quarter results. And I\u2019d say that still is where our target is, is at or around that 58% efficiency ratio in Citicorp for the full-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And I know it\u2019s hard to talk about seasonality and given the flurry that we just had of activity in the markets business in June. But how would you characterize how we should think about quote, unquote seasonality or normal seasonality in the summer for the business. And do you \u2013 have you seen any change in activity as things have kind of calm down post the initial reaction of f Brexit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The \u2013 it\u2019s still very, very, very early in the third quarter. So it\u2019s a little hard to comment on activity for an entire quarter after just eight, nine trading days. But the activity levels are fine that I think it\u2019s good. And we\u2019ll have to see how everything holds up into the month of August, but again the beginning part of July looks fine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. One last or one for me just in terms your NIM comments and then just that we know that Costco is going to full quarter in the third, it\u2019s a pretty good line of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I like the prospects of growing NII, I mean, obviously with Costco coming on, that gives us the big boost. I talked about the momentum that we got in for the consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America with branded cards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, yes, we \u2013 I don\u2019t have a prepared comment on guidance on NII. I don\u2019t like to give guidance on individual line items of the income. But, yes, we feel very good about the NII, and that\u2019s why we feel that the NIM should improve back up to the 290 or maybe a little higher range in the second-half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ken Usdin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, understood. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. John, a couple of questions. The first is on Slide 28, where you have the ICG unfunded corporate energy exposure?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The double and single B component looks like, it actually grew by close to $1 billion versus last quarter. And I\u2019m wondering, if that\u2019s from actual additional exposure or is that from the down \u2013 the ratings migration of existing exposures?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, and some of that is migration. There\u2019s a variety of factors that that go into that. But there\u2019s nothing in there that would indicate that there\u2019s something deteriorating, or anything else it\u2019s just a series of puts and takes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And the \u2013 I think you previously indicated that 65% of the total of about $35 billion is either investment-grade or has credit support. Has that figure changed at all?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I don\u2019t have that in front of me. So I apologize for that. We\u2019ll have to get back, yes. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any big deterioration there. I just don\u2019t have that with me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great, no problem. And then just following up on sort of several of the questions and your responses, we think about the back-half of this year. It sounds like what you\u2019re pointing us towards is balance sheet expansion driving NII growth with perhaps a little bit of a lift also from NIM, continued positive operating leverage from lower repositioning costs and some improvement in the provision guidance, although still incremental build, but potentially some lesser degree of trading revenue. Is that broadly correct?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I\u2019m not going to comment on what you might pull out of your own model. But in broad strokes I would be cautious about thinking that I\u2019ve guided you to balance sheet expansion. Balance sheet expansion is not really something that we\u2019re targeting. As I said, we still believe that we can optimize our balance sheet. So I wouldn\u2019t factor in undue expansion of the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Yes, I was sort of speaking of within Citicorp, but rather than broadly. But would Citicorp still be broadly low like, I mean, I think it was up about 1% in the period?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The balance sheet growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m not prepared to give forward guidance on the balance sheet. Let\u2019s just say that, again, from the overall level of about $1.8 trillion for the overall Citigroup, that\u2019s broadly the area that we still believe that we should be operating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Wasserstrom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great.

Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, John, I had a quick question on CCAR, maybe a bit of a follow-up to Erika\u2019s earlier question. The results are priced very positively in the latest round. As you prepare for some of the tougher elements like GCIB surcharge inclusion, how are you thinking about the capital minimums or targets that you need to amass to day to day as part of your allocation process? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to whether this has changed significantly just given the favorable results that we saw in the latest stress test round?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, first of all, Steven, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do about GCIB surcharge in CCAR, because unless something happen this morning while I\u2019ve been sitting here we haven\u2019t seen any proposed rule yet. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re obviously aware of the rhetoric that\u2019s out there. But, again, we just don\u2019t know, so that has not impacted our planning as yet at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, got it. And I recognize, John, that you don\u2019t want to give explicit guidance on balance sheet growth expectations, but with the price of RWAs come down in the quarter and given the growth in both loans and assets, I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle as to what was driving that. I know that there\u2019s some FX translation impacts that could influence the moves in RWA. But given how much Holdings has shrunk, is it reasonable to assume that RWA growth will wrap Citicorp growth going forward in terms of\u2026?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, actually, if you \u2013 yes, Steven, if you look Holdings RWA declined by about $8 billion or $9 billion in the quarter. And if you look our RWA overall dropped by about $8 billion in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, okay. One more quick modeling question for me on legal and repositioning costs. You\u2019d guided to the 225 basis points for Citicorp for the full-year. It looks like there has been a higher run rate in those expenses in the first-half. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation for what we should be modeling for the second-half for legal and repositioning?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would still say that for the full-year, the 225 is still a pretty good number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Matt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just stepping back bigger picture, you\u2019ve done a lot of work in the credit card businesses, a lot of upfront investing, obviously renewal of some contracts, gaining some contracts. So there\u2019s still obviously the execution to do, but it seems like the heavy lifting has been done from an investment point of view. If you look at the rest of the franchise across the products and the markets, are there other areas that you want to focus on increasingly so on investment dollars, or do we start to see maybe some moderation in some of the spend?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the investment perspective, Matt, I think we remained largely consistent with the things that we talked about before. So we talked about equities and we talked about what we\u2019re trying to do there the combination of prime brokerage, the combination of cash derivative Delta One and investments in people balance sheet, et cetera. So those continue. Investments in our network and our cash management business in that investments in digital and our interface on the consumer side. So, again, things that we\u2019ve consistently spoken about those investments continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just how you think about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would describe it\u2019s outsized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Is it fair, I mean, it feels like the credit card and some of it shows up in expenses and some of it\u2019s a contra-revenue. But it seems like that was a pretty big effort to get behind you. And are these other things more kind of in a run rate or business as usual?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say from a technology perspective, we probably need to think of a lot of those investments ongoing as business as usual. I think of the equities investment is probably being slightly different in terms of \u2013 there\u2019s a life to it and there\u2019s a set of expectations that we\u2019ve got to make sure we achieve out of those investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think, Matt, what you\u2019ll see is, we\u2019ll continue to invest where we have the prospects for growth. So you\u2019re likely to see still we\u2019ll have investment spending in Mexico, but that is captured in the guidance that I gave you as far as our belief of generating positive operating leverage in the second-half of this year and positive operating leverage in consumer in 2017, so that\u2019s embedded in that. We\u2019ll continue throughout U.S. to spend money to enhance our digital capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we do have investment dollars at play. So I don\u2019t want to tell you that, we\u2019re not going to be investing. Just to keep our TTS network in place, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that is not going to stop. But I think the spirit of Mike and I are trying to answer your questions, we don\u2019t see any large lumpy dollar where we\u2019re going to tell you that this is going to be some negative impact on our financial performance for the next several quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt O\u2019Connor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.

And I\u2019m wondering, do you get any credit from the regulators for this in your opinion? And is there an opportunity, do you think at some point, maybe it\u2019s once we get through the CCAR buffer for GCIBs that\u2019s coming. But do you think there is a point when you\u2019ll be able to talk to them about the DTA utilization and the incremental capital from that going towards share repurchase as opposed to factoring into the whole CCAR process?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When we think about capital generation and in particular capital returns, we don\u2019t as you reference think of that in terms of earnings, because we\u2019ve got the capacity and I think Slide 33 shows the drivers of capital and DTA that we\u2019ve got this ability through the utilization of DTA and again $10 billion used we since it peaked to generate regulatory capital at a kind of pretty significant rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we understand that if we\u2019re not returning all of that excess capital and so if we measure ourselves, we measure ourselves against finding capital constraints, and today that would most likely be CCAR. What do we need to run the institution, what do we need is a buffer, and it\u2019s our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can\u2019t use. And in this environment that\u2019s probably the bulk of earnings and DTA liberalization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when you think about the difference between our TCE and our CE Tier 1, it\u2019s largely the $29 billion of disallowed DTA. And so as we liberate that, we\u2019d like to return them. I think it\u2019s part of that conversation that\u2019s not nor will be a prospective conversation. But as we liberate it, we then want the ability to return that in arrears. And we\u2019ve been in conversations with our regulators about that and that will I think continue to show itself over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I guess, is it \u2013 this upcoming rule that we\u2019re waiting for from the Fed regarding the GCIB buffer, GCIB surcharge increase for the folks like you that we\u2019re waiting for you get through that and then maybe the ask can go up? I\u2019m just wondering how you think about timing around that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve consistently talked about walking the ask up. This year was a tripling of the dividend and meaningful increase in terms of buyback and it\u2019s our intention around the right operating environment and the right results to continue to do that. And again going back to the knowing that unless we do that and we return or use all of this excess capital, we\u2019re going to have a denominator problem. And so we\u2019re committed to doing that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Betsy Graseck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple one. First of all, John, in terms of the DTA utilization, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times on the call freeing up that asset. I guess, I\u2019m just curious why the pace of the DTA utilization was so much slower in the second quarter than the first quarter, given it looks like North American consumer profitability, pre-tax profitability was roughly similar quarter-over-quarter? And just looking through some of the ICG numbers, that it appears North American profitability there was also relatively similar quarter-over-quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Matt, if it was very simple to give you the formula as far as how you drive down the DTA, I\u2019d love to lay it out. But it just doesn\u2019t work that way. It has to do with certainly where the earnings are generated, importantly, how much of that is coming out of current taxes that that are due as opposed to how much you can put against your deferral.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s difficult to give you well if earnings are bit and the DTA will be back. There\u2019s just a lot of other things that go into it. But in general, again, we\u2019re focused on driving it down. And I think as Mike said, we\u2019re obviously been able to do that in billion dollars of utilization over the last couple of years. And we should be able to continue to utilize it somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year that\u2019s going to be the pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just moving on to page 24 of the supplement, I realize we\u2019re looking at end of period balances, so there may be something skewing this a little bit. But the corporate loans in EMEA grew in the second quarter at a much faster rate than you\u2019ve seen them grow year-over-year. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s sort of a one-quarter blip possibly driven by Brexit, or are you really driving market share gains on the lending side, partly because of some of the challenges of the European banks?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I don\u2019t have a great answer for you on that, Matt, I\u2019m sorry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just finally, John, maybe following up on Betsy\u2019s question. Looking really at this CCAR cycle, you\u2019ve obviously had some good news in terms of living will, your CCAR proposal was accepted without any change. I guess, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about potentially requesting a de minimis or a further increase in the buyback in this CCAR cycle using the de minimis exception?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Matt, in that, I would say that it\u2019s still relatively early in the year, let\u2019s see how the year progresses and where we are and we\u2019ll make that judgment or that call later in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klainhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Brian.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had two questions. First on the Costco, you mentioned that the reserving would start in the back-half of this year, but do you get from the fair value marks, does that last you to third quarter? So you\u2019re not really going to see the reserving start until the fourth quarter, or does that start as early as the third quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, it actually started in the second quarter. But, again, we only had the portfolio for 13 days. But if you remember we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated when we\u2019d purchase a loan portfolio, we acquired the receivables and they\u2019re recorded at fair value, so there\u2019s no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR build.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a matured portfolio, in a matured portfolio that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, if the acquired loans don\u2019t have an LLR, there\u2019s no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build to a, let\u2019s call it normalized LLR for an acquired portfolio is actually depended on how fast the new loans are created, as well as how fast the old loans pay down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if the pay down rate really has the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high pay down rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more front-loaded than with the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you\u2019re going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks. That was very helpful. And then also related to Costco on the purchase, obviously the intangibles went up. What\u2019s the life of those for the amortization schedule? Is it amortized over one year, two years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I believe tangibles would tie back to the contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just lastly, I guess going back to 2013, I mean, Mike you provided a nice update as to back in March of 2013 as to your long-term strategy of where you\u2019re going to be investing. Is there any plans to provide another one of those updates of the kind of benchmark what you\u2019ve done over the last three years, because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been done, but kind of what you are going to do to kind of drive the company forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we plan on doing that. We haven\u2019t set a date in terms of coming out. But probably sometime over this summer or as we get to the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ll probably come out with some talk about when we\u2019re going to go up more broadly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Klainhanzl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Gerard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John, you talked about how you had better than expected growth in the number of new cards from the Costco \u2013 new accounts from the Costco acquisition in these early days. Were the purchase sales as better than expected as the acquisition of the new accounts?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Purchase sales, I can say are running roughly in line with what we had anticipated, maybe a little bit higher, but roughly in line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And the two-thirds outside of the store, is that in line with your expectations as well on the purchase sales?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s in line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Is there anyway of taking this bigger with your global reach outside the U.S. than what maybe American Express could have done with Costco?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m not prepared just to talk about. Let\u2019s absorb what we\u2019ve got right now first. Obviously, we\u2019re still working through the $11 billion portfolio that we have a 11 million new card members, let\u2019s give them a delightful experience first and then we\u2019ll think about international.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Clearly, you guys have made a commitment to cards with this acquisition and your other acquisitions. Are there any other portfolios that you are aware of that might come up for bidding in the next 12 or 18 months of meaningful size?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Corbat</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of meaningful size. There is a couple intermediate size bites over the next few years, but there\u2019s nothing of any real significance. Obviously, like we have in the past, we\u2019ll continue to look at those, and if the numbers and returns work, we\u2019ll obviously compete for them, and if not we won\u2019t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to this question. Obviously you guys are very well capitalized. The regulators control what you can give back in excess capital similar to your peers. Is there ever a thought of if you\u2019re limited and we won\u2019t know for a couple years that you can only give back what you earn every year and nothing above it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is there a thought with your investments in the digital consumer capabilities that you are doing, that mobile channel to pursue a more aggressive consumer business in the United States, obviously you don\u2019t have a retail branch network and you probably don\u2019t need it in the future like some of your bigger peers. But is there any thought that you guys have, as your mobile channel is very robust, very strong, can you take that even bigger to grow that faster nationwide?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think we have that opportunity whether or not, we have the issue that you talked about. Again, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to end up with. But even if we are able to return all the capital that we think we have, I think we still have the opportunity to grow our consumer business in the U.S. as a result between digital and mobile. Those are things that we\u2019re definitely focused on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Shifting gears on you, I know you talked about the ICG business and obviously what went on post Brexit with the trading. Was there any significant change in the pipeline in investment banking activity post Brexit? I know it\u2019s not that long ago. But anything there to talk about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think the pipeline remains pretty strong. And actually on the heels of Brexit, we saw actually quite good deal flow. You saw debt capital markets, you saw equity capital markets, you saw M&amp;A getting executed getting announced. So I would say the pipeline for the third quarter remains pretty strong and provided we get reasonable markets. We\u2019ve got an environment in which we can continue to get these things done. So it feels pretty good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just finally, your \u2013 obviously your credit quality has improved dramatically and it\u2019s still very strong. But there\u2019s always moving parts, and so one of the questions on the moving parts is, I think it was on the supplement package on page 33, you give us the breakout of your non-accrual loans in corporate and consumer. I notice you had some real good improvement in Latin America, they dropped quite a bit. But EMEA jumped up quite a bit in the quarter on non-accrual. Was that in energy-related credit or Brexit related credit or credits?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two energy-related names in EMEA caused that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gerard Cassidy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. And look forward to see those, Mike, those new guidelines that you guys are going to hopefully announce later on. And just I would also throw an Investor Day now that you guys are moving forward, you might want to consider that for 2017, even though Susan is probably not happy about that. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gerspach</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we have no further questions in the queue at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Susan Kendall</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right.
