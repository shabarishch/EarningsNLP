P&amp;G would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.</p> <p>Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures.

I\u2019m here at home by myself coming to you through my cell phone. John Chevalier is at his home and is prepared to jump in if for any reason my connection fails and I can\u2019t reestablish it. We\u2019re all going through a difficult and challenging time. And I want to start by expressing our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and are<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> well. Thank you for joining us on accelerated timing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our motivation in advancing the timing of this release was simply transparency, giving information to you and to the market as quickly as possible. We\u2019ve had a very strong quarter, but I\u2019m going to start by outlining our priorities in<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> the crisis period. These have been and will continue to guide our actions and our choices. I\u2019ll then move quickly to strategy, which remains unwavering. I\u2019ll discuss actual and potential results for three time periods, the quarter we just completed, which as I said was strong; the long-term on the backside of this crisis; and then, the short to midterm as we all work our way through this.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Following this, I\u2019ll answer a couple of anticipated questions and then turn to additional questions that are on your or your clients\u2019 minds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first priority in this crisis is to ensure the health and safety of the men and women we work with, our colleagues around the world. Second, we\u2019re maximizing the availability of products that help people and their families with their health hygiene and cleaning needs, which has never been greater. The next priority is helping society meet and overcome the challenges we all face. Taken together, these priorities help ensure P&amp;G is there, there for employees, there for consumers, there for communities who have always been there for us. Let me briefly discuss each of these priorities in turn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Employee safety and health. With guidance from medical professionals, we\u2019re constantly evaluating and updating the robust measures already in place to help our people who are making packing and shipping P&amp;G products stay safe at work. This includes temperature scans, shift rotations, queuing avoidance and physical distancing. We\u2019re performing comprehensive methodical cleaning of all production areas including regular sanitization and surface disinfection that exceeds the most rigorous health authority standards. We\u2019re also equipping and encouraging all employees to make smart appropriate choices, such as staying at home if they feel unwell or part of high risk groups or have preexisting medical conditions. In all cases, we\u2019re partnering with our colleagues individually and proactively to ensure they feel and are protected and safe. This has never been more important as many of our facilities are running around the clock to deliver P&amp;G products during this period of increased demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our industry-leading benefits plans play a critical role in providing P&amp;G people with the resources they need to care for themselves and for their families. From paid leave and comprehensive medical care to flexible work arrangements and financial support, P&amp;G people can work confidently knowing that the Company stands with and behind them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s been very inspiring to witness the many actions service people are taking to support and care for each other, demonstrating creativity, flexibility and commitment, truly P&amp;G people at their best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to product availability. P&amp;G products play an essential role in helping consumers maintain proper hygiene, personal health and healthy home environments. Our products clean your laundry, your home, your hair, your body, your hands, and we clean and shave your face. We provide hygiene products for feminine protection, Baby Care, adult incontinence and bathroom needs. Hair Care, shampoos to clean hair and conditioners and treatments to improve hair health. Facial cleansers, body wash, hand soaps and antiperspirants deodorants address additional hygiene needs. Our OTC health care products provide proactive health benefits as well as important symptom relief. These products are more important than ever, given the needs presented by the current crisis. The increased awareness around health and hygiene and the additional time we\u2019re all spending -- many of us are spending at home.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consumption of hand soaps has obviously increased. Consumers in the U.S. are doing more laundry loads per week and washing more garments after wearing them just once. More loads are being done with unit dose detergents. We\u2019ve seen a spike in demand for Tide antibacterial spray. This care consumption has increased as families eat more meals at home and are more concerned about the hygiene of their dishes, glasses and silverware.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">More meals at home means more surface cleaning, often with a preference for a disposable cleaning solution versus a funky sponge, dingy cloth or suspect mop, leading to increased consumption of Bounty Swiffer and Mr. Clean.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In late February, we launched Microban 24, an antimicrobial technology that keeps surfaces sanitized for up to 24 hours, when used as directed. The power behind Microban 24 is a multilayer protective shield that binds the bacteria-fighting ingredient to the surface that\u2019s been cleaned, even when contacted multiple times, helping homes stay cleaner and more hygienic, longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve been working lockstep with governments around the world to make sure we can continue to operate, enabling us to help people and their families meet their health hygiene and cleaning needs. Our operations have been resilient. As of today, our 108 manufacturing plants along with our network of external suppliers are broadly operational with only a few at modified capacity as a result of regulation, workforce, travel restrictions, curfews, material availability or quarantine needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">March was a true test for our product supply planning and logistics organization, which they passed with flying colors. We set records for volume of product produced and shipped. Our largest five North American plants produced and shipped 22% more cases in March than the average of the prior 12 months. The P&amp;G supply organization delivered similar records across Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world, incredibly impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the next priority. P&amp;G has a long history of supporting communities in times of need with the products we produce and other forms of support. P&amp;G donations of product and cash are significant and will continue to increase as we work with communities around the world to support their efforts to help people through this crisis. Millions of P&amp;G products are being donated, helping to ensure that families have basic access to the everyday essentials many of us take for granted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re partnering to provide additional support with some of the world\u2019s leading relief organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross Americares and Direct Relief and key regional organizations such as Feeding America, Matthew 25: Ministries, the Child and Youth Development Foundation, One Foundation, the Korea Disaster Relief Association, the United Way and many others. We\u2019re working to protect health care workers and first responders. United States Center for Disease Control has issued the guidance recommending proper shaving when wearing N95 and similar respiratory masks in order to ensure proper mask fit for maximum protection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gillette has donated razors around the world to hospitals and other facilities to protect the people working to care for others. We\u2019ve modified equipment to produce hand sanitizer in nearly a dozen manufacturing sites around the world, using it to ensure our people can continue to operate safely and sharing it with hospitals, health care facilities, and relief organizations. Colleagues in our Gattatico plant in Italy volunteered to create an extra shift to produce surface cleaning and sanitizing products that are being donated to 70 hospitals across that country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Work is underway to produce critically needed nonmedical facemasks. We\u2019re already up and running in China and the U.S. and we currently have teams working to solve additional capacity in every region of the world and will quickly begin production in those areas in coming weeks. When fully operational, we expect to be producing more than 10 million masks per month. We\u2019ve leveraged P&amp;G R&amp;D, engineering and manufacturing capability to quickly produce face shields in Boston and Cincinnati, which are currently being used in hospitals and COVID-19 testing centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re using our marketing and communications expertise to encourage consumers to support public health measures to help flatten the curve and slow the spread of the virus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">P&amp;G is committed to the priorities of ensuring the health and safety of our employees, maximizing availability of products and helping society overcome the challenges of the crisis. Our strategic choices remain the right ones and serve each of these priorities: A portfolio of daily use products, many providing health hygiene and cleaning benefits and categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice; superior science-based products delivered with superior packaging and retail execution; consumer communication and value in all price tiers where we compete. As you know, we\u2019ve made investments to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands, and we\u2019ll continue to invest to extend our margin of advantage and quality of execution, improving options for consumers around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The strategic need for this investment, the short term need to manage through this crisis and the ongoing need to drive balance top and bottom line growth including margin expansion, each underscore the continued importance of productivity. We\u2019re driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program, cost productivity and cash up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Success in our highly competitive industry requires agility that comes with a mindset of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. In this environment, that agility and constructive disruption mindset are even more important. How can we be even safer while both produce even helping more, what new needs must we meet and what new ways, an ongoing mindset of constructive disruption and disruptive possibility. Our new organization structure, six industry-based sector business units that manage our 10 product categories with a differentiated approach in focus markets and enterprise markets, and very small corporate groups with best-in-class function expertise is serving us well. A more empowered, agile and accountable organization with little overlap or redundancy following to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver our priorities around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These strategic choices we\u2019ve made to focus and strengthen our portfolio and daily use categories where performance drives brand choice to establish and extend the superiority of our brands to make productivity is integral to our culture as innovation, to leave constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability are not independent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we said at CAGNY, the best response to the uncertainties and sources of volatility we face is to double down on this integrated set of strategies, which are delivering very strong results. These integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies are a foundation for strong balanced growth and value-creation. The best response to what we are challenged with today is to push forward, not to pull back, and that\u2019s exactly what we intend to do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to now describe how this approach has played out in the quarter we just completed and how we think it could play out across both, the longer term and the arguably more challenging short to mid-term. First, as I\u2019ve said, strong results in the January to March quarter. When we spoke with you at the CAGNY conference on February 20th, we said that results for the January to March quarter in China and for the total Company will be materially impacted on both the top and bottom-line by the dynamics affecting the market in China. Remember at that point in time, COVID-19 was really just a China and travel retail issue. Korea had reported only 50 cases. The U.S., Japan, Italy and Iran combined had reported only 30 cases, 15 and 10, 3 and 2, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At CAGNY, we were internally expecting organic sales in Greater China, our second largest and second most profitable market to be down as much as 20%. Through the incredible efforts of our organization, we did much better than we were expecting in Greater China, down only 8%, excluding travel retail. We saw a strong lift in our categories in e-commerce that make up a portion of sales lost in closed physical stores. We quickly restored production capability, built share as a result and are now operating at very close to full strength. As the pandemic unfortunately developed in the U.S. and Europe as the quarter progressed, demand surged. We finished the quarter with organic sales growth of 10% in the U.S., 14% in Canada, 6% in European focus markets, 15% in European enterprise markets and 11% in Latin America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At CAGNY, we were internally projecting Q3 organic sales growth for the Company of around 2%, we delivered 6% with 9 of 10 categories growing organic sales. We built aggregate share, despite temporary out-of-stocks in some of our highest demand items. While we don\u2019t have final U.S. all-outlet share through March, share results and track channels through March show broad-based growth. Vicks respiratory products were up more than 4 points, Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol up 3 points. Olay moisturizers and Oral-B power toothbrushes up more than 2 points; Always Pads Always Discreet, Tampax, Tide, Dawn, Cascade and Gillette blades and razors each up 1 point or more; Pantene, Head &amp; Shoulders, Old Spice, Native, Secret, Crest, Mr. Clean, Gain and Bounce, each growing share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see in the track channel data, our share declined recently in baby and Family Care categories, due largely to out-of-stocks on our high demand brands. We\u2019re pushing production to its limits but we expect share softness to continue while consumer pantry stocking remains at extreme levels. In China, we built share in offline stores and in e-commerce. Safeguard and Gillette delivered strong share performance in both channels. Head &amp; Shoulders is particularly strong offline in a way Whisper and Pampers posted solid online share growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Top line results this quarter obviously benefited from consumer pantry loading in preparation for in-home quarantining. We\u2019re planning for pantry inventory levels to eventually return to normal. This higher level of consumer demand was served with our ramp-up and production levels and the depletion of retailer inventories. As at-home inventory decreases, we expect to refill the retail inventory pipeline. We believe the net effect of all of this shifted about 2 points of sales growth on a global basis from Q4 into Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Back to CAGNY, we were expecting a slight decline in core earnings per share for the quarter. We delivered instead a $1.17 per share, an increase of 10%. The significant volume of sales increase, related fixed cost leverage and our ongoing productivity efforts more than offset a growing FX challenge and higher virus-related operational costs. Commodities also provided a benefit. Core gross margin up 120 basis points, excluding currency up 130. Core operating margin up 100 basis points, currency-neutral core operating margin up 180 basis points. Core earnings per share up 10%, currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15%. $4.1 billion in operating cash flow, adjusted free cash flow productivity at 113%, returning $2.8 billion in cash to share owners, $1.9 billion in dividends and $900 million in share repurchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, January-March, 6% organic sales growth, 10% core earnings per share growth, 113% free cash flow productivity building share. Fiscal year-to-date, 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth, over 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity building share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just two days ago, we announced a 6% increase in our dividend, reflecting both, these results and the confidence we have in our future. This was the 64th consecutive annual increase and the 130th consecutive year in which P&amp;G has paid a dividend. So, that\u2019s January through March and fiscal year-to-date, very strong results in very difficult conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shifting to longer term, we remain well-positioned to serve consumers and create value in a very attractive industry. And as I said previously, our strategy to do this is unwavering. Consumption of our products is not likely to dissipate. In fact, the relevance of our categories and consumers\u2019 lives potentially increases. We will serve what will likely become a forever altered health hygiene and cleaning focus for consumers who use our products daily or multiple times each day. There may be an increased focus on home, more time at home, more meals at home, more cleaning of homes with related consumption impacts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The importance of noticeably superior performance potentially grows. There\u2019s potential for increased preference for established, reputable, dependable brands that solve newly framed problems better than other alternatives, potentially less experimentation. Potential for a lasting shift for e-commerce, both etailers and omni-channel. Our experience to date makes us believe we are generally well-positioned in this environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Increased demand has focused retailers on the core SKUs that drive the business. There\u2019s potential for this to result in a cutting of the long tail of inefficient SKUs and brands in our categories. We\u2019re discovering daily lower cost ways of working with fewer resources. Today\u2019s necessity birthing the productivity inventions of tomorrow. New digital tools are being brought to the forefront, providing another productivity rocket booster on the factory floor and in the office environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in the longer term, we believe we are relatively well-positioned to serve consumers\u2019 heightened needs and their changing behavior to serve the needs of our retail and distributor partners across channels and geographies and to create value. In the short to midterm, outcomes are frankly anyone\u2019s guess.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Epidemiologists will have wide variations in their best and worst case scenarios for viral spread, mortality, the shape and duration of the curve. We may see months of sporadic production suspension due to local quarantines or raw material supply. It\u2019s not just our operations that matter here. It\u2019s those of our suppliers, of contractors and of our transportation partners. A lot must go right in a very challenging environment and not all of it will.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Customers may close stores. There will continue to be extreme foreign exchange and commodity costs volatility. Added operational complexity will result in higher costs. Unemployment will impact outcomes, perhaps severely. All of this occurs on top of what was already unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in our categories and markets. But, as you saw in the development of the business in just five weeks from CAGNY to March 31st and as we\u2019ve just talked about in our long-term outlook where there\u2019s volatility, there are opportunities to serve as well as challenges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s a very wide range of possible near-term scenarios and it\u2019s futile to spend too much time trying to assign probabilities to each. We\u2019d be fooling ourselves and fooling you to try. As we stand here today though, we continue to believe our guidance ranges for the fiscal year on both the top and bottom lines remain relevant. Our internal forecasts remain within these ranges. But, I must again emphasize ranges and I must again emphasize the degree of uncertainty and volatility we face day to day. We currently expect organic sales growth for the year in the range of 4% to 5%, assuming continued operations in our facilities and those of our customers and suppliers. On the bottom line, we\u2019re forecasting core earnings per share growth in the range of 8% to 11% for the year. This tool assumes no significant interruption in the extended supply chain through to our retail and distributor partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This earnings per share range now includes over $400 million of after tax foreign exchange headwinds. Just since CAGNY, FX has moved against us by approximately $0.10 per share, over 2 percentage points for core earnings per share growth on the year. And the fourth quarter FX is currently forecast to be a 7-point hit to core earnings per share growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please recall that our fourth quarter bottom line comps include the earnings gains from the Boston land sale and the divestiture of two Oral Care brands in the base period. These items combined are an additional 7-point headwind to core earnings per share growth, Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we do expect some midterm benefit in commodity costs from the recent decline in oil prices, it usually takes about six months for movements in feedstocks like oil to make their way through the raw material supply chain and our inventories to our P&amp;L. That we don\u2019t expect to offset to FX headwinds from lower commodity costs within this fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result of all of this, you might likely guess that we\u2019re closer as we talk today to the bottom end of the earnings per share guidance range than the top end. But, we also go back quickly to our priorities and note that none of the three include hitting quarterly consensus estimates. We will be focused on serving colleagues, consumers, customers, communities, building our business for the many more months that will follow this crisis than the months that will exist within it. But we\u2019ll do this responsibly and keep our choices squarely centered on mid and long-term value-creation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 100%. We\u2019ll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash return expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends, share repurchase in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. We\u2019ll provide our first outlook for fiscal 2021 on our year-end call as we typically do in July.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before turning to your questions, I want to address just two items I expect are on your minds. The first is liquidity. Our liquidity status remains very strong. We are a 183-year old company this year and we take a long-term view to balance sheet management. We aim to maintain our AA minus credit rating and to manage within the ratios that support that rating. With a $5 billion term issue three weeks ago at approximately 3%, we now have $15 billion in cash on hand and are generating more each day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to have open access to the U.S. commercial paper markets, recently issuing over $3 billion on three months paper as a part of our routine financing efforts. The amount of debt maturing in the next 18 months is well within anticipated cash availability. And while we don\u2019t expect to need to draw on them, we have $8 billion in bank credit lines available if needed. That\u2019s credit, very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second topic is recession. We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s already here and will be here for some period of time. While we are not immune, our current strategy puts us on better footing than prior downturns to weather economic headwinds. Our portfolio is now focused on daily use items where performance drives brand choice. We have much less exposure to discretionary items than we had during the last downturn. We\u2019ve increased the superiority of our offerings, simultaneously increasing their value. While not perfect, we had stronger entries across price peers, better pricing ladders. We\u2019re emphasizing performance-based value messaging. We will serve with relevant pack sizes designed to hit key cash outlay thresholds for consumers who need to make week-to-week purchase decisions based on cash availability. Our productivity muscle is now well developed. None of these make us recession-proof, but they should each help.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Summing up, the men and women at P&amp;G working together to deliver three very strong quarters, averaging 6% organic sales growth, 16% core earnings per share growth and over a 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, we\u2019ve built market share. Our Board has increased the dividend 6%, reflecting both strong results and confidence in the future. We really do believe there is a very bright future ahead. We\u2019ll manage the short to mid-term, consistent with the strategy we\u2019ve outlined many times and against the immediate priorities of ensuring employee health and safety, maximizing availability of our products to serve health, hygiene and cleaning needs and helping society overcome the challenges of this crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re stepping forward, not back. We\u2019re doubling down to serve consumers and our communities. We\u2019re doing this in our interest and society\u2019s interest and in the interest of our long-term shareholders. While we may not see you in person soon, we look forward to engaging with you on the phone and would love to hear your voice. We are here with you and are here for you. Feel free to call our offices as you normally would, our phones. You know where to find us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll be happy to take questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Powers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Jon. Thanks for the comprehensive update. Clearly, a ton of questions. I guess, maybe we could start with just a little more detail on what you\u2019re expecting in terms of the shape of demand, both consumption and shipment wise as we head into the fourth quarter, especially in the U.S. where it appears shipments lag. Consumption in the March period, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting a reversal of that in the coming quarters. Just some more color there, as well as China, where as you say things seem better, on trend versus where you thought they\u2019d be in February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, I\u2019m also curious, just building on your final comments there around preparedness for coming recession. I guess, if you think about where you are in your fiscal \u201821 planning process, could you just give us a little insight as to how -- clearly this has been an abrupt change, but in terms P&amp;G\u2019s planning preparedness, how recessionary planning has factored into your thinking more on a run rate basis? Like, are you -- I guess, the question from investors is, are you scrambling to put in place the recession playbook or is this something that P&amp;G has been factoring in and considering for some time? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Steve. As it relates to the fourth quarter, there are, as you readily appreciate, a ton of moving parts. Geographies are in very different places in the cycle, categories have different levels of need and demand. There\u2019s the supply situation and then there is the retail inventory dynamics as well as consumer pantry dynamics. And again, you multiply that by a 100 countries around the world and 10 categories and many more brands and you realize that you probably don\u2019t have the answer. As we were sitting together at CAGNY five weeks ago, I don\u2019t think any of us in our conversations would have assumed how the next five weeks would unfold. And I don\u2019t pretend to know how the next 8 to 10 weeks is going to unfold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Having said that, you mentioned China. Our business there is rebounding nicely, both from an operations standpoint and from a consumption standpoint. We are seeing a continued significant demand in our categories and the supply and retail inventories are being steadily rebuilt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>In the U.S., -- and I focus on these two markets because as you know, they are our largest markets, so to give you some relative feel. April has started off very strong double digit rates from an order standpoint. We expect that to tail off as the lines are set between retail inventory, restocking and consumer demand. But having said that, we are definitely seeing increased consumption levels, not just increased buying levels to put in pantries. I mentioned that in the U.S. we\u2019re seeing an increase in the number of loads of laundry that are done per week, the number of garments that are cleaned after one wearing. With much more in-home meal preparation, there\u2019s a lot more cleaning that needs to be done. And we\u2019re seeing consumption, for example at-home consumption of cleaning aids,, whether that\u2019s surface cleaners or paper towels or Swiffer continuing to be very, very strong. Our Home Care business, if I have my numbers right, was double digits in sales and that\u2019s following or in line with what we\u2019re seeing in terms of consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Now, having said all that, and sorry for the long answer but there\u2019s no short one. We have never faced the level of unemployment that we\u2019re likely to see in this country and potentially in others. And we don\u2019t know how long that will occur for. We\u2019ve never faced a complete shutdown of very important channels of commerce, whether that\u2019s travel retail, whether that\u2019s the electric channel in Europe, whether that\u2019s the specialty beauty channel. So, there\u2019s a huge amount of volatility we\u2019re likely to experience and we\u2019ll learn more every day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Our fourth quarter sales guidance, deductively, given fiscal year-to-date results and our fiscal year guidance is minus 2 to plus 2. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the pull-forward from Q4 to Q3 was about 2 points. So, that minus 2 to plus 2 on an apples-to-apples basis is really zero to 4. And while that may not seem like a lot, given a 6 year-to-date, recall again a number of things. One, it\u2019s our highest comp period. So, last year, organic sales by quarter were 4, 4, 5 and 7. 2 will have a full quarter of the impact of these channel closures and store closures. 3 will have the inventory dynamics, however, those net out that I described.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, when you put all that together, zero to 4, accurate, I doubt it, but it\u2019s representative of the combination of all those dynamics. So, it\u2019s the best number we have. And again, I apologize for the length of this answer, but it\u2019s not a topic that lends itself to simple formula.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On recession and recessionary playbook, I really do believe that we have made major steps as a company since the last recession that significantly improve our hand, whether that\u2019s productivity, whether that\u2019s a focus on superiority, which is critical, because certainly price points matter and we\u2019re prepared to address that. But overall, value proposition really matters. And at a time when there\u2019s heightened concern about the need for a product to work and be efficacious, as I take care of my family and my home, the superiority plays an even bigger role. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the changes we\u2019ve made there I think will put us in much better stead. I talked about the portfolio and the difference and the preponderance of our product serving needs on a daily basis versus much more discretionary portfolio and not daily use based in some categories that we\u2019ve divested. So, this is a playbook that we\u2019ve been developing for both good times and bad times, month-by-month, year-by-year. And I really do believe we\u2019re in a better position. Having said that, when something significant like this happens, would it be right to sit back and assume that we\u2019ve got it covered? No. So, we are making very deliberate plans business by business, market by market to ensure we\u2019re as well positioned as we can be. And there will be changes and there will be adjustments, and they won\u2019t always be right, and we\u2019ll have to remain agile and learn and adjusted as we go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lauren Lieberman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks. Hi, Jon. I was hoping you could talk a little bit. You mentioned that you are focusing your production on kind of key SKUs, starting to talk about thinking through changes in pack size and affordability. But, I was also wondering about promotional spending. We\u2019ve heard certainly from some of the food companies already just about promotion, more or less and stores being shut down U.S., and that\u2019s happening in Europe I\u2019m assuming by government mandate. So, how should we think about pricing going forward, even just from the standpoint of complete change in the promotional landscape, just normal everyday kind of stuff. So, that was one area of question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the other thing I was curious about is we haven\u2019t talked much about emerging markets outside of China. And just thinking about as the virus presumably spreads and start to have a bigger impact in some of your enterprise skewing markets, how you are maybe planning for that or what\u2019s kind of built into the thought process beyond the next, probably a month or two on this getting worse in emerging markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Lauren. The promotional dynamics in our categories are changing pretty significantly, just as they are in food and beverage, which you referenced. It\u2019s really nobody\u2019s interest to be promoting products when you don\u2019t have them, when there is not a sufficient inventory to supply demand. So, if we look at for the full quarter, the amount of volume in our categories as a percentage of sales that moved on promotion, that\u2019s down about 5 points, and obviously that number would be much more significant in the month of March. And I don\u2019t really know how that will develop going forward, but certainly, if I had to guess, there will be less promotion in the next couple of quarters where the job is restocking and replenishing than had been the case historically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Price in the quarter was a net benefit of plus 1. And if I look back over the last 30 quarters, price has typically been a benefit of 1 to 2, sometimes, very rarely, but sometimes zero or minus 1, sometimes a little bit more, in that range. But it\u2019s pretty much in that range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as I mentioned, our strategy is unchanging. So, an innovation based strategy, I don\u2019t see any reason why there will be a dramatic change in the contribution of price, particularly also because you have significant currency devaluations in many parts of the world, where some amount of pricing will be needed over time, done appropriately and sensitively to recover cost structures in those markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right now, in emerging markets outside of China, we\u2019re operating and thinking rightly or wrongly, day-by-day, because situation changes dramatically. India is a good example. That market is effectively shut and will be at least through the end of April. We\u2019re working with governments, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to establish the essential nature of our product categories for their citizens and therefore gain the ability to operate, which we largely have. That\u2019s been a significant focus area over the last five weeks, and it\u2019s a daily endeavor. And then, once we establish our ability to operate, we then have to source materials and we have to ensure that employees can get to work, which sounds simple, but is anything but. For example, we\u2019ll go back to India again, there is a prohibition on any transport of people across state lines. And you can imagine, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual that we might have a plant or two that are located close to a state border, and you might imagine that some of the people that work in that facility live on the other side of that line. So, that\u2019s just an example of kind of the level of operational agility that we\u2019re having to execute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In order to continue operating in the Philippines, we had to basically secure access to a dorm next to our production facility in which to house and protect employees as a condition of operating. So, we\u2019re not that far out in our thinking about how to operate in these markets. Right now, it\u2019s day-to-day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dara Mohsenian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I just want to spend some time on your market share expectations going forward. The comments were helpful in terms of thinking about a recession. Obviously, you guys have had a lot of market share momentum over the last couple of years, particularly in the U.S. Can you just discuss the forward puts and takes, as you think about a post-COVID environment, all your market share. And specifically, what I was most interested in was consumer trade-down risk in your mind and then also in emerging markets as you think about covering FX pressure there with pricing, relative to local competition. Can you talk about how market share dynamics would play into your thought process there? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some real positive developments from a market share standpoint as I walked you through over the last quarter, and no reason for those underlying trends, not to continue, particularly when they\u2019re based on again, performance advantages at a time when performance is required more than ever. Will there be a trade down pressure? I don\u2019t know, but I think it would be silly to assume none. And will there be some share pressure as a result of pricing moves that need to be made? Undoubtedly that we\u2019re going to be very careful in terms of pricing that we do take in emerging markets and will likely tie that much more closely to local inflation than we would to the financial markets and currency and as a result should encounter fewer issues relative to competition than we would if we were just pricing to the currency conversion number. The biggest pressure on shares in the near term is none of any of that. It\u2019s the ability to supply very, very high levels of demand in some categories. I mentioned two categories in our prepared remarks, Family Care, which is our Bounty and Charmin business, and Baby Care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And let me just describe briefly some of the dynamics that occur in the Family Care category as an example. We can see a scenario where our business continues to grow at strong double digit rates and we lose share. That\u2019s because the market is growing at an even higher rate than that. Many of our competitors in that business source the industrial or commercial market, as well as the consumer market. Our business is entirely focused on the consumer market. Those companies have the ability with what is largely a shuttered hospitality industry as an example, to move production from an industrial or commercial focus to a consumer focus. You don\u2019t have that excess capacity to make that move. So, our throughput is up significantly on a per line basis. The results are going to be very, very good. But, we will probably, in that context, lose some share. So, what I wouldn\u2019t expect going forward, and I\u2019m -- here I\u2019m talking about the next three to six months is a continued steady increase in share levels. But, I also wouldn\u2019t expect significant diminution of our position. We\u2019re committed to not have that happen. We talk about that actively. But, there will be more volatility in the share numbers just because of all of the market dynamics that we\u2019re trying to manage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>The next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br><strong>Q - Wendy Nicholson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Two question. First, pretty straight forward on Microban. It seems like great timing to have launched that, but I\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t expanded it to more a consumer centered business as opposed to professional. So, any plans there? I also noticed that you don\u2019t sell Microban rights, which seems like a category that\u2019s just going to be bigger and grow there for a long time to come. So, can you just comment on why or why not you might enter that category? And then, can you talk about just e-commerce generally? I assume servicing the e-commerce channel is no different than servicing other brick-and-mortar retailers. But maybe can you talk about -- I don\u2019t know that I heard how much it grew in the quarter or what percentage of business it was in the quarter, especially in the U.S.? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br><strong>A - Jon Moeller</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Sure, Wendy. Let me start with the second part of your question. The e-commerce business grew about -- globally about 35% in the quarter. It\u2019s now about 10% of our business globally. As we\u2019ve talked many times previously, we view ourselves as very well positioned within that channel and continue to strengthen that position. The two largest sources of growth by far are the U.S. and China with some categories growing in e-commerce in those two markets, as much as 50%. And obviously the at-home dynamics and the unwillingness to congregate in physical stores is driving a fair amount of that. We\u2019ll have to see where that nets out, but I don\u2019t think it all goes away. I think, we\u2019ve seen a permanent shift in the percentage of business that\u2019s going to be done in e-commerce and we view that positively. And when I talk about e-commerce, I\u2019m talking broadly including omni-channel, click and pick, and all forms and varieties of e-commerce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>Microban is a wonderful, fantastic product. We were serendipitous in terms of our launch timing. We are at full capacity at this point and are focused on the products we currently have in markets and the channels that we\u2019re currently operating in. But obviously, we\u2019ll work to develop that business to its full potential and that could include a number of different avenues of pursuit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Olivia Tong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two questions here. How does it change how you think about new product rollout timing? Do some ideas get backtracked while others get pushed out promotion strategies, how you market and build trial, because obviously market advisors can\u2019t really do their job right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>And then, secondly, in terms of margins, how does the current environment sort of help or hurt the margins? Because the categories that are moving are typically lower margin, but commodities have obviously come down and promotion isn\u2019t quite as necessary in many of these categories in the near term. But on the other hand, FX is worse and we expect it to some trade down. So, just those two areas, if you could elaborate on both, that would be great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we obviously saw a positive margin development in the quarter we just completed. We\u2019ve seen positive margin development fiscal year-to-date. Our guidance would imply positive margin development for the fiscal year. And as we talk about balance growth and value-creation, I\u2019ve explained many times, but it\u2019s not possible to get to where we want to get from a value-creation standpoint without strong top line growth and margin improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, there are some headwinds but there are also tailwinds, commodities as you mentioned, should be a tailwind longer term. And we\u2019ve got our -- we continue our efforts on our productivity program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there\u2019s additional learning that\u2019s come out of our experience the last five weeks on ways we might be even more productive, both in generating top line sales and in containing cost. So, my expectation there is that there continues to be a level of margin improvement going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of product launch and we\u2019re in the middle now of going through each category and determining are there any changes that need to be made, either out of necessity or by design to maximize the impact of those planned initiatives. And in terms of how products are brought to market, I don\u2019t see really significant changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, there\u2019s more media consumption that\u2019s occurring right now than probably there has been in the last three or four years. So, changing that model doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense. And by media, I\u2019m talking about not just TV but digital consumption as well. So, I don\u2019t see significant changes there. I think, our model with some adjustments will continue to be relevant and effective. And then, we just need to look at timing by initiative there. I wouldn\u2019t expect a net of that exercise either to have a significant impact on our ability to continue to grow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Strycula</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning and congratulations on being able to raise the dividend in a period of time like this and deliver consistency in results. Jon, I have a question. I appreciate that the Company\u2019s pivoted and evolved this portfolio to more daily use products over the last decade. But, could you help us for the products that you still have in today\u2019s portfolio? How did the organic sales really perform during the financial crisis for those products that are still in the portfolio today? And then, I have a quick follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have a category by category analysis of that. I just haven\u2019t had the time to get to that, although it\u2019s a very good question. But, what we do know and we refreshed learning on over the last five weeks is what\u2019s happened to market sizes in our categories during times of recession. And as you\u2019ll readily understand, our categories are not immune from recessionary impacts, but they\u2019re much less sensitive to that dynamic and most other categories across industry. And so, if we look at recessionary periods, the market has typically contracted in terms of its growth rate. So, it\u2019s continued to grow, but has contracted maybe 1 point. So, then the question becomes, okay, one, can we do anything about that if we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two, what\u2019s your relative position within that market and are you well-positioned to at least hold your ground if not build your position? And again, I feel better about that than I have at any time in our recent history. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be categories that from a market standpoint aren\u2019t impacted with more than others. And that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be individual situations typically at a brand or category country level. In fact do lose some share. But, I mean, put it this way, as we think about our planning for next year, we\u2019re not giving ourselves any break relative to share. We expect to hold and build share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Strycula</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for that. And then, a quick follow-up. For emerging markets, I\u2019m not asking about the month of April. We\u2019re taking a longer-term view here. But, in a marketplace where maybe some of the points of distribution are temporary shuttered and consumers are being impacted by the macro, can you expect that volumetrically, household, personal care products as an industry should be able to grow during a period like this of volatility. And what can you guys do within Procter\u2019s capability to be able to execute under that type of environment? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely, we should expect growth in these markets, absent physical barriers, either regulations or operational barriers that prevent products from getting first into stores and into markets and into consumers\u2019 hands. It\u2019s not necessarily a harbinger of the future, but I mentioned Latin America as an example growing 11% in the last quarter. The fundamental drivers of that demand remain as we go forward. In terms of our ability to capture those opportunities, our strategy in emerging markets is fundamentally the same and it\u2019s been working very, very well from both the top line standpoint and a bottom-line standpoint. By the same, I mean, our focus on superior products in daily use categories where performance means brand choice, delivered as productively as we can, and we still have lots of opportunities to improve in that context. With excellent communication, best-in-class go-to-market execution, the playbook is the same and works in enterprise markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason English</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Good morning folks. Thank for sliding me in. Jon, you\u2019ve covered a lot of ground, and I appreciate the thoroughness. I\u2019d love just to dive into a couple of business in a little more depth as possible. First, you mentioned that travel retail has been a bit more challenging. Can you contextualize how large is it for you as a percentage of sales and how it performed last quarter and what you\u2019ve seen more recently? And secondly, in terms of results, Grooming was a bit of a surprise to me. And you in mentioned in the press release some weakness in North America. Maybe I missed it, but I don\u2019t think you covered off on it in prepared remarks. Can you touch on what\u2019s happening in the Grooming business, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me start in a slightly different place, but I will get to your end points. The Beauty business generally and which is a primary business that\u2019s sold in travel retail, continues to perform very strongly. We hit our 17th quarter of organic -- consecutive of organic sales growth in Beauty in what is arguably the most difficult quarter we faced in a long, long time, really significant and positive growth across almost all parts of the portfolio. So, we overcame in the quarter a greater than 20% reduction in SK-II sales with solid growth in our other categories. The travel retail business specifically is round number, is a $1 billion business that\u2019s gone. It\u2019s gone because there\u2019s no travel. Having said that that -- the products that were brought in travel retail were consumed in markets and our job needs to be to make up for that travel retail loss in the near term by serving those markets. And we are for example, seeing significant uptake already on SK-II consumption purchase in mainland China, which was one of the big sources of the travel retail demand. So, generally, are performing very, very well in Beauty. And we\u2019ll continue to -- the SK-II impact will have a full quarter now going forward for the next three quarters in all likelihood. So, the challenge will become greater in terms of overcoming that. But, we\u2019re in a pretty good position to be able to at least make progress in that direction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a Grooming standpoint, we don\u2019t share during the quarter on global basis, which is great, and follows on a number of periods in a row now of share growth for the global Grooming business. The biggest challenge we face on -- we face two challenges in Grooming currently. One is, which I just -- actually I don\u2019t even know I talked about it here, doesn\u2019t matter, is the closing of the electric channel in Europe where a large amount of Braun products were sold. That also affects, by the way our power Oral Care business, which also utilizes our channel. But presumably, as soon as that reopens, which hopefully will be soon, that challenge dissipates. The other challenge is lower shave frequency while working from home, to put it bluntly. But, that\u2019s something where we\u2019re currently working through. As I said, we\u2019ve built share, we want to maintain our share position. We need to work with our retail partners as well who have in some cases, de-prioritized grooming in the very near term to deal with the empty shelves and some of the other aisles of the store. If we can do that effectively, no reason we can\u2019t continue to hold and build share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrea Teixeira</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. And I wish you continued health, to all of you on this call. Jon, I appreciate the bridge of underlying zero to 4% globally. And just to think about the puts and takes by region, what are you seeing in terms of the pickup in China? And I think you alluded a little bit on the call, an improvement in Beauty and Baby there. And do you expect, by my math, 80 basis points drag in the third quarter? It seems flat in the fourth, and be above the zero to 4 range that is implied. And also a question on mix, which is the improvement in skincare globally in China coming back help the mix effect, which I think was flat in the quarter just concluded but typically was up 50 to 100 basis points in the past. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br><strong>A - Jon Moeller</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>So, definitely relative to the quarter that we just completed, China offers upside quarter-to-quarter sequentially, and I expect that upside is significant. I would see us growing that business ideally at very healthy levels, at pre-crisis levels ideally in the subsequent quarter, which you\u2019re right, would get -- give a lift to the zero to 4 kind of logic. We are seeing, at least in China, mix come back in pre-crisis levels from a positive standpoint. I mentioned the strength of the SK-II restart as an example. So, that also is a positive. But remember, we have massive challenge ahead of us collectively in the U.S. and Europe, depending on how the economy develops. I mean, we literally sense the Great Depression had not managed with the level of unemployment we might see. So, the question behind your question is, is there upside to the zero to 4, I would encourage you not to go there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nik Modi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jon, it\u2019s pretty clear looking at the data that consumers are migrating back to big brands. Now, that could be because of availability or just safety and comfort in there in what they\u2019re getting. But I\u2019m just curious on two fronts. One is, kind of as you\u2019ve been interacting with retailers, how do you think this is all going to shake out in terms of how they think about taking on the brand? I think, you made some comments earlier in the prepared remarks on that. But, any specifics would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>And then, the second thing is, there\u2019s a lot of trials happening right now for a lot of brands that maybe consumers may not have tried and some of your brands. And so, I was just thinking about proactively like what Procter &amp; Gamble could do to kind of create stickiness with some of that trial going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><br>A - Jon Moeller</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><br></strong>I\u2019m going to focus my comments on the U.S. There\u2019s been active partnership, very active partnership on the part of ourselves and our retail partners to ensure that the SKU lineup that exists in stores today maximizes throughput all with the design to best serve our consumers and their shoppers and to ensure that product is available. So, there\u2019s been in some categories, a fairly significant concentration of SKUs, on the power SKUs that generate the most movement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re not at a place yet, as I mentioned, where retail inventories have been sufficiently replenished. So, for the near-term, I think this dynamic continues, but they and we are very focused on staying in touch with consumers and consumption and what they demand. And that will ultimately be the driver of our skew lineups. And I don\u2019t see situations where our retail partners and ourselves will view that very differently as long as we keep our eye on their shopper and our consumer. And our SKU portfolios will need in order to fully serve consumers. So, we expand. But, I don\u2019t think it necessarily goes back to everything that was on the shelf previously. I think, this is a reset opportunity for us and for our retail partners. And I\u2019m encouraged by the conversations so far in terms of approaching that in a constructive, partnered fashion. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But, the trial dynamic that you mentioned, unfortunately it works both ways. So, I gave you an example, for example in Family Care where there are consumers that are trying products that they haven\u2019t tried before, but they aren\u2019t necessarily ours. And we need to work hard to ensure that we maintain mental and physical availability to the greatest extent possible, so that those consumers return to their beloved and trusted brands which are ours as they\u2019re more fully available.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the other hand, you\u2019re right, there\u2019s big upside here in terms of reminding consumers of the benefits that they\u2019ve experienced on our brands and how they\u2019ve served their and their families\u2019 needs, which is why this is not a time to go off air. I\u2019ve talked to several other companies in different industries now who are viewing this as a time when we should be cutting back on support. And obviously, if you\u2019re in an industry that doesn\u2019t operate in this environment, that makes sense. But, in ours, I mentioned more media consumption now than ever. Your trial retention point builds on that. And this all ties back to the comment I made several times in my prepared remarks about doubling down and moving forward, not backwards. This is not a time to retrench. And really that\u2019s all in service, in service to consumers and service to our retail partners and we believe in service to a broader society.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin Grundy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Good morning Jon. Congratulations on the strong quarter, particularly in the current environment. Jon, I wanted to come back to longer term implications for consumer behavior, given the nature of the current recession, increased working from home and social distancing, and what this is going to mean longer term. You touched on some of this, so positive for cleaning products and Fabric Care, potentially negative for categories like blades and beauty for people working from home. So, I wanted to come back to this. As you see it, what are the longer term implications versus those that are more transitory? How are those conversations going internally? How is the organization balancing near-term objectives given the challenges in the current environment versus potentially modulating the playbook here a bit with what could be longer term structural changes to demand in some of these categories? So, additional thoughts there would be helpful. Thanks Jon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We need to stay very close to consumers and their habits, needs and desires more now than ever. Just because we\u2019re at change points in their habits and their consumption levels, and we need to understand those and be responsive to those. We actually meet as a portion of the leadership group three mornings a week at 7 o\u2019clock. And one of the things that we\u2019re very focused on in that meeting is, what is changing relative to consumer need and making sure, I mentioned SKU portfolio is one example, but making sure that we\u2019re positioning ourselves to serve those changing needs as well as we possibly can. I think, the net in terms of demand impact on our total portfolio is clearly a positive longer term. And I don\u2019t -- and when I say that I almost -- I don\u2019t want to minimize for a second any amount of human suffering that\u2019s led to the situation. But, we are seeing increased levels of consumption in the majority of our product categories. Even when we come to something like Beauty, remember, I talked about how this is a 17th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth in a row. And to get to organic sales growth on Beauty with a minus 20%-plus number on SK-II, you have to assume very healthy purchase and consumption levels across the portfolio, which we\u2019re seeing. And I don\u2019t see a reason that that wanes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, generally, thank you for pointing again to the long-term, which we view as -- we want to -- it\u2019s trite and overused statement, but we really do expect to come out of this stronger than we went into it. We really do believe that there\u2019s a very bright future ahead. And to your point, we need to be very deliberately keeping ourselves aware of what those opportunities are and putting steps in place to be able to seize those opportunities again really under the heading of fully serving consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Astrachan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks and good morning, Jon. I wanted to ask just briefly on private label. So, how should we be thinking about, how you\u2019re thinking about what potentially happens brands versus private label as obviously unemployment increases here. Commentary, what specific things you think we should be watching for categories that are more susceptible than others, I recall paper that\u2019s being one of those that we\u2019ve watched historically. And so, what are you concerned about? What are things we should be focused on and how do you think about that in terms of playing out this time around?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Generally -- so, let me take you through recent trends and then I realize your question was more future-focused. We\u2019re seeing modest increases in private label share in North America, at the same time that we\u2019re building significant share ourselves. We\u2019re seeing private label share declines pretty consistently in Europe at a time when we\u2019re building share there as well. We can grow our business and our share and Europe is a prime example, we\u2019ve done it for years, during the time when private label is growing. So, that\u2019s the first and very, very important point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, in terms of recessionary dynamics, as it relates to private label, I don\u2019t -- we see a number of different behaviors, which affect that overall equation. There are certainly a subset of consumers for whom price becomes a significantly greater portion of their personal value equation. And that will in some cases result in a trade down to private label. Our job becomes having an offering alternatives for them that allows them to achieve the same objective within our branded portfolio. And we have many more rungs in that pricing ladder now than we had during the last recession. There are other consumers who move the other way for whom performance, efficacy, dependability, I can\u2019t afford to be wrong, I can\u2019t buy two, so I need to buy the best, results in a migration to branded offerings. And that\u2019s different by category and by market. But again, going back to something we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in this call, I don\u2019t see any reason for us to have an expectation of ourselves that we hold their build share over reasonable periods of time, I mean given month or given quarter, or given category or given country will have issues. But our expectation is that, whether this is a V-shaped recovery, whether it\u2019s L-shaped recovery, whether it\u2019s a prolonged recession, with our portfolio as it\u2019s structured today, continued to focus on superiority, continued focus on excellence and execution, we should be able to hold and build share positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question will come from Bill Chappell with SunTrust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bill Chappell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two quick questions. One, I\u2019m not sure you can answer, but maybe from what you\u2019ve seen in China or what you\u2019ve seen elsewhere, I mean, if you\u2019re looking at a given category that had 10% type increase, would you say like -- is there a way to say like 5% of that is pantry stocking, 2% of that is a stay-at-home orders and then the rest is just normal growth? I mean, is there any way to look at that? And then secondly, on advertising, what\u2019s the plan in this environment? It seems like most large CPG companies have moved away from product advertising and moved more to kind of this is the company message and we\u2019re all in this together, which is great, but just didn\u2019t know if -- that the longer term it\u2019s going to change or cut back or if that\u2019s something just temporary?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in some categories, Bill, we have -- we do have the ability to tease out increases in consumption from pantry loading, et cetera. And for example, there are several categories in the U.S. where we have a panel of either consumers or devices, washing machines, dishwashers that give us information on a routine basis on consumption levels. And where we have that in place, that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to know, for example, when I mentioned earlier, what\u2019s happening to wash frequency of clothes and what constitutes that load, the same in a dishwashing context. So, we\u2019re able to in those categories, see very clearly the increase in use and consumption and obviously then deduct into what might be pantry stocking. There are other categories where we don\u2019t have as good a visibility into that, but we\u2019re working to develop that ability across each of the categories in the major markets, and that\u2019s the clear focus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>But, I would say that in general, we\u2019re seeing as much as a 20% increase in consumption across categories of where you\u2019d expect to see that and the balance is pantry to some extent. But remember also, in many of our categories, pantry availability itself leads to greater usage. I start conserving on my usage for example of paper towel or certainly of bathroom tissue as I reach the end of my inventory to defer that trip to the store and certainly avoid a situation where I don\u2019t have any available. If there is lots available, I\u2019m typically not rationing or conserving. So, just having it there results in increased consumption in many of our categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>I\u2019m not the expert in the company on advertising, but I would offer a couple of thoughts. Helping consumers understand how they can meet their own perceived and critical needs for them and their family through the use of our products and many categories is a public service. And as well for many years, well before this, we focused on, if you will, both. Think about the Always Like a Girl campaign as an example. And done well, you can do both simultaneously. But, again, I\u2019m not the advertising expert. If you want more perspective on that, feel free to call my friend Marc Pritchard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question will come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Ottenstein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much. And, Jon, thank you to you and your colleagues for all the things that you\u2019re doing to make Procter &amp; Gamble increasingly indispensable. Two questions. First, clearly e-commerce is becoming increasingly important, obviously in the U.S. and in China. Can you talk about the things that you are doing to become increasingly advantaged and meet the needs of your e-commerce partners in the U.S. and China, and maybe what your market share looks like in e-commerce versus brick and mortar in the U.S. and China? And then, the second question, obviously 6% increase in the dividend is impressive. But, I think what would be most interesting for me is to understand the thought process in that increase, given your very clear eye view of the sorts of challenges that the world faces over the next 12-plus months. So, how did Procter &amp; Gamble think about that sort of increase in that context? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Moeller</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me start with the second question. We have a very simple philosophy and belief, which is that the cash we generate is not ours, it\u2019s yours. And we have -- that\u2019s of course after meeting the needs of -- and opportunities that are presented by attractive investments. We\u2019re having a good year. And if we deliver against our guidance, it\u2019ll be 8% to 11% core earnings per share growth, operating earnings growth has been pretty much in line with that. And going back to the philosophy and the commitments, that results in a certain outcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our business is generally highly cash generative. So, I mentioned we generated $4.1 billion of cash in the quarter. Our payout ratio, with the move we\u2019ve just made is a little bit under 60%. So, there\u2019s plenty of room there, if you will. So, it really stems from our philosophy and our commitment and our result and the cash generative nature of our business. And I don\u2019t expect that to change going forward. Obviously, in extreme situations, we might come to a different conclusion. But so far we\u2019ve been weathering this situation fairly well and expect to do well as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I might also just comment on the general topic of capital allocation. I started receiving some questions on share repurchase and whether that\u2019s appropriate use of funds in this environment. And I don\u2019t fully understand the question. I do, if you\u2019re accepting government support or something like that. But again, going back to our philosophy, that\u2019s your cash, not our cash that needs to come back to you, either through a dividend or share repurchase. And probably, the worst thing we could do at this period of time when I go back to our priorities, the third one being to help society get through this crisis is take a bunch of cash and sit on it. We\u2019re much better off, I think, returning that cash to society and helping people, during a very difficult time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as you know, we have a large percentage of retail share owners, individual people, and we have a large ownership position from pension funds, which are representing the needs and wants and dreams or desires of frontline healthcare workers, firemen, policemen, of the bus driver, of teachers. And so, I don\u2019t see any reason not to maintain the stance we\u2019ve taken for many, many years relative to cash return. And I think it\u2019s more vital now than ever. Sorry. I got kind of waylaid on that point, but it\u2019s what I feel strongly about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to e-commerce, it differs pretty widely by category, by country. But, generally, our market shares in e-commerce, our online shares are equal to our offline share or slightly ahead. And also, our margins are generally in line, online and offline. In general, the things that we do to win and best serve consumers offline are relevant online as well. But, there are some specific things we can do to better serve both online shoppers and online retailers, for example, with packaging that\u2019s designed to survive the e-commerce journey, which was physically very demanding, and we\u2019re working to develop proprietary packaging that improves packaging integrity and consumer experience in that specific channel. So, there are channel specific areas of superiority that we can help our customers be relevant and in the process increase our relevance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are no further questions at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jon Moeller</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks everybody.
