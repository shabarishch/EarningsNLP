Today, we will discuss our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year against the backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We will also provide a preliminary view of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This morning, Anthem reported third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, down 14% over the prior year quarter. Our results in the quarter reflects the impacts of ongoing COVID-19 treatment costs, the continued return of a more traditional utilization environment, as well as our ongoing commitment to address financial imbalances to our customers and members. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Since the onset of the health crisis, I\u2019ve been incredibly proud of the way Anthem has continued to respond as a trusted health partner. Beginning with the earlier days of the crisis, we pivoted quickly and look for opportunities to serve in new ways to address the evolving needs of our customers and members and to make a positive difference in the lives we serve. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Armed with our purpose of improving the health of humanity, Anthem has continued to leverage our insights, innovation and partnership to improve lives and deliver a simpler, more affordable and more effective healthcare experience. The heart of Anthem is our local legacy and longstanding focus on the communities where we live and work. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, those communities are struggling with issues around food and security and health disparity, social unrest and economic challenges. Our focus on community health fueled by our $50 million commitment seeks to eliminate health disparities and racial inequity. Our passion for this work is driven by our strong track record of addressing true, whole person care, is a social drivers of health. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Throughout the pandemic, we have been connecting with our high risk members, screening for key health factors around housing, food and transportation, as well as ensuring that they have access to basic necessities such as face masks, hand sanitizers and cleaning supplies. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Food and security is not a new issue in America, but the pandemic has only intensified the problems. We know food and security is directly linked to the whole health of individuals, families, communities and businesses. Together with our partner Feeding America, we are calling on leaders across the country to join together to fight hunger and improve the health of our nation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Here in Indianapolis, we\u2019ve committed with our partners to provide 10 million meals to local residents in need through mobile food banks and program outreach. Anthem has also partnered with Aunt Bertha, a leading social care network help connect individuals and families for free and reduced cost social services in their communities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These programs include COVID-19 specific assistance with food, transportation, job training and more in every zip code across the country. Supporting efforts to create a more just society is an ongoing priority at Anthem. In light of the health disparities and racial inequities laid there by the pandemic, our work in this area has only accelerated. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For our associates, we continue to reinforce our strong culture and drive an inclusive environment for everyone. And in the City of Indianapolis, we are lending our voice and commitment, the INDY Racial Equity Pledge. This pledge spotlights our joint commitment with the local business and civic community to take meaningful actions to address the issues of health and racial equity towards the goal of a more just community for everyone. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We were also pleased to recently be named to Forbes Annual List Of The Most Just Companies ranking number one in the healthcare sector the second year in a row. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We know this year\u2019s flu season is going to be particularly challenging for our communities in combination with the rising spread of COVID-19. In response, Anthem has launched our Fall Flu Campaign, partnering with over 100 community-based organizations across our markets to stand up more than 500 pop-up and drive-thru clinics providing free flu shots in underserved neighborhoods. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Anthem is continuing to lead and shape our industry for the digital future and our experiences with COVID-19 have only accelerated our innovative efforts in this space. Our Sydney Health Application has more than 2 million unique downloads is helping ensure our members get the care they need where and when they need it. Sydney is delivering personalized engagement, and real-time access to health information, telehealth services and AI symptom-based triage. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Psych Hub is providing a range of mental health resources designed to help consumers and their families cope with the pandemic-related stress brought on by social isolation, job loss, and other challenges. This resource hub is a collaboration among several national leaders in the mental health community. Telehealth usage has been strong and we see that trend continuing, particularly for behavioral health services. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Since the onset of the health crisis, telehealth now comprises 40% to 50% of all behavioral health services compared to low-single-digit utilization pre-COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Investor Day last year, we shared our vision for modernizing our business by consolidating our systems platforms, automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AIs across the enterprise to simplify and improve the customer experience. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The charge this quarter enables us to enhance our speed to market as an enterprise to streamline our operations, accelerate our digital journey and ultimately deliver a better experience for those we serve. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our experience in the last several months of the pandemic saw the pivot quickly to operate virtually and challenge our ways of working. With the insights from this experience, we are reimagining our workplace to the reduced real estate footprint, more selectable work practices and evolving our offices to serve as collaboration spaces when safely able to do so. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Membership trends in the quarter were strong despite the challenging economic environment. Medical membership totaled 42.6 million members, an increase of 172,000 lives sequentially, driven by continued robust organic growth and market share gains in Medicaid and Medicare. This was partially offset by attrition in our commercial business, as a result of the prevailing economic environment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The risk of a more significant deterioration in our membership is real. But thus far, our overall membership trends are outperforming internal expectations. Our commercial membership declined 0.9% sequentially, which beat expectations in both our risk and fee-based businesses. New account sales supported by new virtual strategies and tools outpaced lapses for the second consecutive quarter despite the challenging environment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the Large Group segment, net new Large Group risk sales have exceeded lapses in the 11 of the last 13 months. Importantly, we remain discipline in our pricing and go to market strategy keeping an eye on long-term customer retention. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we expect to see some headwinds from in group changes over the next several quarters, our focus on sales effectiveness, affordability, and offering a portfolio of product options to meet customers where they are continues to pay-off. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While the 2021 selling season looks different than most, our results year-to-date increase our confidence through sustained momentum in new sales growth, powered by our focus on whole person health. Our Medicaid membership grew by nearly 390,000 lives in the quarter and is up nearly 18% year-to-date due primarily to the pause on re-verification. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The financial performance of our Medicaid business in the quarter was significantly impacted by retroactive, prior period rate adjustments, that totaled nearly $300 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we previously shared, our second quarter results were impacted by the broad based deferral of normal healthcare utilization, while the experience in the third quarter reflects a considerable increase in COVID-related costs, which we expect persists through the balance of the year more than offsetting the impacts of deferred utilization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to work with our state partners to achieve reimbursement levels that are actuarially found while earning a reasonable return on capital and margins in the 2% to 4% range. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the Medicare business, our growth of more than 16% year-to-date is outperforming the market average and we expect another year of mid-double-digit growth in 2021. The recently released star scores for payment year 2022 however are disappointing. Our pharmacy scores remain the single largest driver of our underperformance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a reminder, our Medicare Advantage members transitioned to IngenioRx on January 1, 2020, which limited our ability to improve our pharmacy scores in the latest measurement period. We are intensely focused on our star ratings with significant improvement expected over the next year. We are seeing a strong start to the annual enrollment period demonstrating that our multi-channel approach is delivering results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Digital platforms have long been an area of focus even prior to the pandemic and this year, we expect to gain a significant percentage of our sales through digital channels. The development of our Medicare Care Guide is just one way we are enhancing our members\u2019 onboarding experience with proactive outreach to help them understand their benefits and enhance the onboarding process and overall new member experience. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our 2021 offering reflects our industry-leading supplemental benefits, which include the popular over-the-counter offering, transportation, dental and vision benefits, as well as benefits to address social drivers of health such as food delivery and service animal care, positioning us for another year of above market growth Medicare Advantage. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, we expect to see nearly 90% of our members in $0 premium plans for 2021 as we continue to the fourth quarter, our compassionate commitment to making a positive difference for all of our stakeholders will continue. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will now turn the call over to John for a more detailed review of our third quarter financial performance and our preliminary review of the headwinds and tailwinds we project heading into 2021. John? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Gallina</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Gail, and good morning. As Gail mentioned earlier, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $4.20, a decline of 14% year-over-year. While our GAAP quarterly results included a few significant charges, our adjusted earnings were otherwise relatively consistent with our overall expectations. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our results reflect the departure from normal seasonality trends due to the continued impact of COVID-19 utilization, as well as the actions we voluntarily took to support our members, customers, communities, and care providers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to offer expanded benefit policy changes to adjust cost share waivers for COVID-19 treatment has access to 24/7 telehealth at no cost, provided grants and support for our communities to name a few. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our adjusted third quarter results exclude our expected share of the impending Blue Cross, Blue Shield Litigation settlement, as well as the charges related to the business optimization efforts that Gail referenced earlier. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impending Blue Cross and Blue Shield litigation settlement removes an uncertain while the business optimization charges are the latest milestone in our journey of delivering on our commitment to achieving an SG&amp;A ratio of 11% to 12% by 2023. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These initiatives are aligned with our enterprise strategy and represent a reallocation of resources in high growth and high impact areas such as AI and digital. After transitioning the majority of our associates to work from home in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were able to reassess and further optimize our real estate footprint as we gained a better understanding of our organization\u2019s capacity to work from home. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Anthem\u2019s third quarter operating gain was $201 million, a decline of $1.3 billion from the prior year. Absent the aforementioned major adjustment items, operating gain in the quarter declined 8% or $126 million. Our underlying results reflect elevated COVID-19-related cost across our commercial and government lines of business and retroactive Medicaid rate adjustment, partially offset by deferred healthcare utilization and strong performance in IngenioRx. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Medical membership was 42.6 million members at the end of September, growth of more than 1.6 million lives year-to-date. This growth is further evidence that Anthem has the most balanced and resilient membership mix in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Time and time again, we have shown the ability to grow at stronger comps which was illustrated by industry-leading organic membership growth in 2019, as well as during periods of economic uncertainty, as we have continue to grow membership throughout 2020. Since the end of the first quarter, enrollment in Medicaid has grown by more than double, a decline in our employer group businesses, excluding Blue Card. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a matter of fact, our Medicaid membership growth is approximately ten times the decline in our commercial risk-based members. And of course, this is going on while we continue to exhibit double-digit growth year-over-year in our Medicare Advantage. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating revenue in the third quarter of 2020 was $30.6 billion, an increase of approximately 16% versus the prior year quarter, and nearly 15% on a HIF-adjusted basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher premium revenue from solid growth in our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Pharmacy revenue related to the launch of IngenioRx and the return of the health insurer fee.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The increase was partially offset by risk-based enrollment declines in our commercial and specialty business driven by higher unemployment rates. The medical loss ratio in the third quarter was 86.8%, a decrease of 40 basis points year-over-year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a HIF-adjusted basis, MOR in the quarter increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by increased cost related to COVID-19 including actions to support our members, customers and providers in addition to the retroactive Medicaid rate adjustments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-COVID utilization in the third quarter largely returned to normal levels or roughly 95% of historical baseline. And when coupled with the cost of COVID-19 care, overall utilization was above baseline. As discussed on our second quarter call, we continue to expect the second half mix adjusted MOR to come in a couple hundred basis points higher than normal seasonality trends would suggest, driven by COVID-19 cost and the continued recovery in non-COVID utilization throughout the remainder of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our third quarter SG&amp;A ratio was 17.3%, an increase of 440 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. However, excluding major adjustment items, SG&amp;A in the quarter was 13.4%, reflecting an increase of 50 basis points. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with return of the health insurer fee, and increased spend to support growth, partially offset by growth of operating companies. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We experienced an operating cash outflow of $1.2 billion in the quarter, a decrease of $2.8 billion year-over-year. The decrease was primarily driven by the payment of the health insurers fee for the full year, as well as the timing of two additional federal tax payments that were previously deferred as permitted by the IRS. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow was $6.9 billion, or 1.7 times to net income. Excluding the impacts, net income from the major adjustment items in the quarter are multiple of cash flow to net income year-to-date would have been 1.4 times. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the balance sheet, our debt-to-cap ratio was 39.2% at the end of the third quarter, which is consistent with our target range. Days and claims payable was 41.1 days, down from 46 days at the end of the second quarter, but up 1.3 days year-over-year with the medical claims liability increasing 14% versus growth in premium revenue of 11% over the same period, evidence of our solid reserve. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.9 million shares at a weighted average price of $265.73 for a total cost of $759 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased 5 million shares at an average price of $269.15 or $1.3 billion in total cost. 2020 has been unprecedented in many ways with much still unclear on the future course of the pandemic and the macro economy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, we are proud of our organization\u2019s ability to adapt, providing care for those we serve and delivering relief and support to our stakeholders. At this time, we remain committed to our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance of greater than $22.30. As you have heard this morning, we have consistently demonstrated strong performance despite operating in an environment characterized by uncertainty. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While COVID-19 is certainly introduced many challenges, our long-term growth plan remains firmly intact as we seek to gain share in the Medicare Advantage market, leveraging growth at diversified business groups, increased the profitability of our fee-based business and modestly grow share in the commercial risk-based business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, we invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day Meeting on March 3rd, where we will discuss our long-term strategy in greater detail. As it relates to 2021 guidance, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Further, as you contemplate the headwinds and tailwinds, we see for next year, please keep in mind there is much more uncertainty than the normal given the unknowns related to COVID such as the timing, and efficacy of a vaccine, or if we could see another round of deferred utilization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that as background, our initial view of 2021 contemplates the following tale; the permanent repeat of the health insurer fees, which we use to partially offset investment in our Medicare business to improve our star scores, accretion from the 2020 M&amp;A activity and share repurchases, IngenioRx growth and the continued progress on our commercial 5 to 1, to 3 to 1 strategy and Medicare Advantage membership growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These will be partially offset by Medicaid reverifications and raid actions in the context of return to a normal operating environment. Commercial enrollment pressure, primarily in-group change as a result of broader economic challenges and higher investment spending to support long-term growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% albeit skewed to the lower half given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, operator we will now open the call for questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-And-Answer Session </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question, we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Valiquette of Barclays. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Valiquette </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So, just on those comments on the tailwinds and headwinds, that was certainly helpful. The one I was curious to hear more about was the higher investment spending. Can you give us give a little more color maybe on that piece, in particular as you are thinking about trends for that for next year versus what you are spending voluntarily this year? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you, Steve. Appreciate the question. And, the higher investment spending really is, putting more and more money into our AI and digital capabilities, investing more in stars in order to ensure that we improve our number of members covered by four star plan in the next rating period and beyond. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And, really the way that that care is going to be accessed here in the future is slightly different than how it\u2019s been accessed in the past from really investing in the various networks and capabilities to meet the customers where they need to be met. So, we\u2019ll provide a lot more specificity on that at Investor Day in terms of automating and reimagining processes and embedding digital and AI across the enterprise. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s all about simplifying and improving the customer experience. So, hopefully that can provide you a little bit of context here in the mean time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll just also reiterate what John just said, which is, we have been investing what we found is that there is an opportunity to accelerate those investments as a result of the increased adaption that we\u2019ve seen over the course of the pandemic, particularly in our digital assets, where we made significant commitments around our Sydney and our Psych Hub and other things where we are seeing our consumers more actively engage with those assets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, stars is obviously a key priority for us and we continue to build a team there as well as invest in ensuring that we can pull through what we are doing in our pharmacy now that we have an under IngenioRx. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Next question please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">A.J. Rice </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Hi everybody. Just one point of clarification and then a question. The 2021 outlook growth rate, is that using 2020 to 2030 jumping off point as the base? Or is there any adjustments we should make in thinking about what the base is for this year? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, my broader question is, you mentioned the puts and takes you have to deal with in thinking about the outlook for next year in developing medical cost trends, can you just maybe flush out a little bit more what are you thinking next year for medical cost trend and what are some of the major unknown variables or variables you have in the reservoir as you think about that cost trend expectation for next year, particularly like in the commercial risk business? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, AJ. Let me start now, have John provide a little bit more color. As you said, at this early stage, our view of 2021 would affirm our long-term EPS growth rate of 12% to 15% off the guidance of 2020 to 2030 as you mentioned. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Although as John commented in his prepared remarks it\u2019s skewed towards a little over a half of the range, just given the unusual risk and challenges presented by the ongoing pandemic. So with that, let me have John give you a little bit more color on some of the other specifics that you asked in your question. John? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you, Gail. And, good morning, AJ. Our 2021 trend expectations and really I think you maybe pointing to commercial pricing actions are very important, obviously many variables they have considered as part of our trend and our pricing assumptions. And I\u2019ll just be clear for everyone on the call here for competitive reasons, we are not going to provide a specific point estimate of where we see trend coming or what our pricing assumptions are at this point in time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I do think it would be instructive to highlight some of the things are considered. First of all, there is a permanent repeal the health insurer fee and that repeal actually is going to save Anthem customers or actually $2 billion in 2021 and certainly we removing its burden helps mitigate the impact of cost. And also, really looking closely at how will care be accessed in 2021. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For instance, telehealth, ER visits, standalone surgery centers, other site of service changes, how are they going to evolve before and after a vaccine is available, And overall utilization be impacted or just it\u2019s the way that CARES Act. Certainly, we are trying to assess the ongoing impact of COVID-19 testing and treatment, assessing how much pent-up demand still exists versus the permanent cancellation of procedures. And then how is deferred utilization impacted underlying acuity. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And like, the list goes up, those are all just variables that are incremental and on top of the normal variables that exists each and every year when we assess trends. So, the one thing I\u2019ll say with all of that though, is that we are being very disciplined in our approach and we are being very disciplined in our pricing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our pricing covers forward trend. We have committed that. We were priced to cover forward trend and we\u2019ll continue to do so. So we\u2019ll provide more insights into this in early 2021 questions on our fourth quarter call next January. And of course, as I stated on March 3rd during our Virtual Investor Day provide a lot more insights. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But these are many of the variables that we are really working our way through right now as we finalize our 2020 year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, AJ </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much.

Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Lake</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. One quick numbers question that I wanted to ask about Medicaid. So, on numbers, can you share with us the next if tailwinds, John, that you talked about that you are thinking about for 2021. I know you said that was offset by some reimbursement in stars. Want to get that net number from you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, can you talk to your views on Medicaid rate actions for 2021 being as given. I remember you expect it to end this year at 3% margins in Medicaid. Can you talk about that within the expectation for next year in terms of \u2013 do you expect to be at that 3% target for 2021? Or do you saw moderation in your \u2013 in services resumes within that 2021 guidance? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Justin, I apologize. Can you repeat the first half of your two-part question? I am not sure I understood everything you said. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Lake</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Just first look at the net if tailwind for 2021? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh the net if tailwind, okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Justin Lake</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Medicaid margins for next year. Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. The HIF, as I said, that was part of the overall headwinds and tailwinds that we had and in response to AJ\u2019s question, we\u2019ve certainly tried to factor everything into our headwinds and tailwinds as part of reaffirming our long-term growth rate and really don\u2019t want to get into cherry picking certain items as to why something as part of a starting point and my something else is not right. On HIF and of itself, we are looking at $0.60 to $0.80 of a tailwind in 2021 associated with the permanent repeal of that law. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Related to \u2013 as we said, part of it\u2019s going to be is to help fund some of the investments in Medicare to improve star ratings and other things. So, there is certainly a lot of fungibility associated with any number of headwinds or tailwinds, but $0.60 to $0.80, I think is the dollarized impact of the question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Related to the 2021 and the Medicaid rate environment, obviously we are working very closely with the states to ensure that we get actuarially appropriate rates working through whether it be the collars of the corridors and how those things are impacting the methodology, I think we\u2019ll advice very wide open in terms of that. And as I said, conversations with our state partners regarding the need to have sound rates as we quickly return to a normal operating environment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, our expectation is, is that, we\u2019ll be able to achieve a appropriate return on capital and operate well within the target margin range in Medicaid in 2021 and are actually focused on being relatively close to the midpoint of that range. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ricky Goldwasser </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi. Good morning. My question is on the utilization trends that you are seeing, also you stated we are returning back to normal. So maybe you can give a little bit more color about the difference between the different books? And what type of procedures you are seeing coming back? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And especially as we think about this is looking ahead to 2021, John, you talked about the difference in the titles procedures is coming back. So if you think about ER visits if you are seeing less utilization there, does this mean that if that\u2019s likely to expect that these types of utilization will be back in 2021 and how is that shaping your thoughts to next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thank you, Ricky for that question. And maybe I\u2019ll provide some context that might answer questions that are in the queue as well in terms of your question. So, if you look at the underlying claims that we are seeing, as I stated in my prepared comments that, they are, excluding COVID would be below baseline levels. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But then, when you add COVID cost back in, we are exiting the third quarter at greater than baseline. So, we started the third quarter with a combination of both underlying procedures and COVID cost being below baseline and we ended the quarter with the combination to being above baseline. We fully expect that the fourth quarter would be above baseline for the entire quarter given the recent surge in COVID, as well as all the other trends that we are seeing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Associated with where we are seeing some of the rebound, outpatient surgery has recovered the fast as pre-COVID and it\u2019s actually even trending above baseline in some instances. Some of the more costly procedures such as joint replacement surgeries have come back faster. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And a lot of that was anticipated and the actions we took to intentionally redirect care to the outpatient setting to ensure continuity of care are coming through. And to that end, we are focused on ensuring our members are getting the care they need in a timely manner, whether it be through telehealth or by redirecting certain procedures to outpatient setting. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The ER utilization is still below baseline at this point in time and we expect that to continue for a while as well. So, we are clearly taking all these things to consideration as we look at 2021 trends and as I stated for competitive reasons, we are not committing to a point estimate at this \u2013 on this call. But there is a natural system capacity constraint that will cause some utilization to carry into 2021 and we are certainly factoring that work off. Thank you for the question, Ricky. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Stephen Tanal from SVB Leerink. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Tanal </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning guys. Thanks for the question. And just on also Medicaid, maybe two-part question on this. So, Medicaid enrollment, obviously been really strong, it looks like pre-determination will be suspended at least through year end based on the last 8-K just \u2013 primarily health emergency. So, wondering if you guys had to do on enrollment in peak and then sort of related, small follow-up. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I believe that pretty decent outlook to the margin, but I guess, we are pointing on the rate path and other corridor and collar type actions you guys are taking, can you give us a sense for what that all in how to enrollment will take in 2020. I think that it was almost $300 million a quarter and how do you think 2021 looks versus 2020? And that would be helpful. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thanks for the question. I am going to ask Felicia Norwood to address some of your specific questions about reverification and timing of rates. But in terms of your very specific question about the all-in, what we expect that to be, as I said in my prepared remarks, $300 million was what we had in the quarter and we are expecting, obviously given where utilization goes and things that could move a little bit around $500 million would be that number. But with that, let me ask Felicia speak to the other questions you had. Felicia? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Felicia Norwood </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Good morning, Stephen and thanks for the question. As you mentioned, Medicaid growth had certainly been accelerated during this period, we\u2019re up 4.8% quarter-over-quarter and almost $389,000 over second quarter. And at this point, I don\u2019t know if we would back to the \u2013 just say when that peak is going to happen. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you take a look at where we are today, states have spend at their reverification at least through the end of the public health emergency. That public health emergency right now will go through January 21<sup>st</sup> of next year. But in addition to the public health emergency, states are also receiving enhanced FMAP. So we would expect that states will continue to suspend reverification through the period of enhanced FMAP. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that could be certainly through the end of January of next year as we head into February. We\u2019ve been in constant conversations with our state partners with respect to continuity of care for our members, particularly during this time of a pandemic. And continuity of care is very important. So we work with our state partners trying to make sure that we are working closely around aborting any type of clip event. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I am not sure at this point, when things are going to peak certainly as long as this has a continuation of the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP that states are currently receiving. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Ralph Giacobbe from Citi. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ralph Giacobbe </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Just want to first just clarify quickly, on the Medicaid side, I think you mentioned target margins to get this 3% by 2021. I was hoping if you could give us a sense of where you think it will shake out for 2020? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, just wanted to ask about, membership was obviously holding better than our expectations and it sounds like your expectations as well. But the overall performance seems generally in line and guidance maintained. So, if you could help on what that delta is? Is it just cost coming back fast certainly you thought? Is it higher COVID or something else? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Ralph, thank you for the questions. In terms of target margins associated with Medicaid, we have \u2013 as you know, we have well over a half of our states are January 1 renewals and we are working very closely with them on rate actions. And that the trend information that\u2019s utilized for January 1 renewals is typically the two prior years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, 2018 and 2019 are the \u2013 really the actuarially sound rate information we have associated with that. So, we feel very good about how those conversations are going and where those rates are coming out. In terms of 2020, it\u2019s an interesting dynamic with all the deferred utilizations, the increase in COVID costs, some of the call backs of premiums, all in, we are \u2013 as you know, we\u2019ve had a $22.30 EPS guidance that we reaffirmed. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The overall margins within Medicaid are coming out within the target margin range, but there is a lot of variables and lot of hard work to get there. But clearly, we are trending in the right direction during this period of uncertainty. Associated with the membership, as you know, we feel very good about our membership. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think we have the most resilient membership mix in the business. We grow in periods of strong economic times. We grow in periods of economic uncertainty. And we made a cognizant decision here in 2020 that, we would help address the imbalances and inequities in the system created by the pandemic. So, as our membership continues to get stronger and stronger, we are helping give it back to maintain our guidance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, lastly, in terms of the fourth quarter, we do expect the fourth quarter to have an elevated medical loss ratio and that\u2019s because the underlying cost of services, plus the pent-up demand that is partially coming through, plus the COVID cost that we are covering on top of all of that, we expect to be above baseline. And so, we are usually looking at a 300 to 350 basis point MOR in the fourth quarter higher than what normal seasonality would suggest. But thank you for those questions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Sara James from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sara James </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Can you speak to what is in federal versus the individual state control of when redeterminations for Medicaid turns back on. I am wondering if we could end up with different states turning on at different times and then when it does turn on, how long does it take to the states to catch up on evaluations and fully base out the benefit? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Felicia?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Felicia Norwood </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Sara and thanks for the question. As I said, I would expect that states would suspend reverifications at least through the public health emergency and the enhanced FMAP. Once that happens, states have the ability to control when they return to reverifications with respect to membership. What the Federal government requires is that, Medicaid members to have their eligibility redetermined at least what, every twelve months. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">States can decide whether or not they want to then execute upon that beginning in the next quarter or thereafter, but you generally get through your entire Medicaid book of business over a twelve month period. So, as we take a look at our portfolio, which as you know is 23 states, all of those states will make determinations around when they commit reverifications at varying different intervals. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are working very closely with our state partners and they\u2019ve been very collaborative with us around helping us to educate members around the reverification process and what\u2019s necessary, once that reverification process commences. But the return to reverification, the timing, the cadence around when that happens with respect to membership is certainly left with the state partners in terms of when that happens. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Felicia. Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question we\u2019ll go to the line of Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin Fischbeck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks. Wondering, I guess, just quantify the 2022 impact of the settlement on the Blue Cross Blue Shield. Just wanted to see this obviously other aspects to that settlement beyond the financial payment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was wondering if you could provide some color on if that settlement in any way would impact your view on 12% to 15% long-term growth, and/or change the way everything as you get to that 12% to 15% growth number? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the question, Kevin. In terms of the settlement that we announced today in the financials, we will be including in our 10-Q a much more fulsome discussion. So, just to give you a perspective of that, which will be filed this morning. BCBSA and the Blue plans have approved the settlement agreement and relief to the subscriber settlement as part of the case. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If approved, which the court still has to review it requires us to make the monetary settlement which we took our portion of its part of the third quarter charge. But also, there are a couple of non-monetary terms. One, eliminating the national best efforts rule in our license agreement. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the second is allowing for some larger national employers with self-funded benefits to be able to request to bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the local Blue plan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know, we fully accrued our estimated liability in the third quarter of 2020. In terms of the impact of that, we view our strategy has been very consistent and don\u2019t really see any changes in our overall strategy. Thanks for the question. Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Joshua Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joshua Raskin </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, just back on the commercial memberships holding up a little bit better, I am curious if you are seeing any recent signs of furloughs becoming more permanent. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you guys have a better view on sort of what percentage your membership is currently in furlough, meaning not getting salary, but still getting their benefits? And then, maybe any geographic areas or segments that are seeing different trends from the overall book. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question. Josh. I am going to have Pete Haytaian response to that on the commercial business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Pete Haytaian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. And yes, definitely commercial membership and enrollment activity continue to perform better than we expected. You noted furloughs. We don\u2019t have specific information on the volume of furloughs. We are obviously paying close contact with our employer and broker partners regarding this and we\u2019ve done a lot to make sure that we protect the membership and provide them with a lot of options in that regard. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d say, that furloughs, as well as the fact that we have a disproportionate share of our membership in less risky segments which has certainly helped us and then as I think you alluded to the unemployment rate, it\u2019s certainly lower than we had originally expected. I\u2019d say, but most importantly, from an execution perspective, in terms of what we can control, I am really pleased with the teams\u2019 performance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our sales exceeded our last as again as we have for the last several quarters. One important point then to note, our fully insured membership in commercial actually only declined 27,000 members in the quarter. So, the overall net negativity that you are seeing in our membership is really caused by in-group change. And then as we look forward, your point about the future, we are modeling continued declines in the commercial market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We aren\u2019t necessarily seeing great variation by market. It\u2019s really hard to predict that with precision. But we are expecting continued declines. I would say that our early read, October is a continuation of what we saw in Q3. So, nothing that\u2019s fundamentally changes that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then finally, I\u2019d just say, I think we are really well positioned. I am very pleased with the teams. The last couple of years we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on investing in a product portfolio and having product options to meet customers where they are and as the economy improves, I am confident that we\u2019ll have a solution for them. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lance Wilkes </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Wanted to ask a little further on 2021 with respect to the employer business, and in particular interested in your outlook for, kind of wins, losses, so not the in-group aspect of it. And then, cross-sales and Ingenio penetration, how is that looking as you are kind of getting through the selling season here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll have Pete add additional more color. But I as I shared in our opening remarks, we feel really good about our ability to increase our sales relative to our lapses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, while this has been a very unusual year, we are still seeing particularly in the mid and lower \u2013 our small group business we are seeing really strong results because of our sales effectiveness. But I\u2019ll have Pete give you a bit more, because I think the work that his team has done over the last two years is really showing results this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Pete Haytaian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks a lot for the question, Lance. In the areas that we\u2019ve closed out selling \u2013 so for example, balancing group retiree we are very pleased, as Gail said with our execution and how we\u2019ve done. The activity in 2020 for 2021, at least in national for example in group retiree was \u2013 that was actives. As you would expect, some of the larger jumbo accounts, they did defer and you would expect that in light of what\u2019s going on, associated with the COVID. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But as Gail said, down market, smaller accounts, we are seeing a lot of really good activity. Our value proposition is really resonating in the marketplace. Our focus on advocacy with solutions like Gail mentioned in the prepared remarks, the Sydney technology, our consumer engagement platform, innovative programs like Total Health, Total You, et cetera are really playing well in the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We launched, as you probably have heard, high performing networks with our Blue Assisted plans across the country covering 55 MSAs. All these things are playing into our growth into 2021 and we feel good about that. Obviously, in-group change and the economy remains a big variable as it relates to the ultimate impacts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to the second part of your question, Ingenio and upselling, our approach 5 to 1, to 3 to 1, as it relates to what we can control, I feel really good about our progress and future prospects getting to the 301. Prior to COVID, this year, we were solidly on track to get to quarter one. COVID definitely did set us back a little bit, as you\u2019d expect. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But even with COVID, we are seeing really good activity across all the component parts that generate growth in our strategy 5 to 1 to 3 to 1. Our penetration rates and upselling rates around specialty products continues to improve. Obviously with affordability being a big focal point us selling the total value proposition across medical specialty and pharmacy, really seems to be playing well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Anthem Whole Health Connections is really resonating similarly with all our clinical programs. We\u2019ve actually pushed really good programs like Total Health, Total You down into the local markets. And then as it relates to IngenioRx, we do feel really good about the future opportunities. Again, very similar, as it relates to big jumbo opportunities, there was a little slowing in that regard and people potentially deferring into the future. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But as we head into 2021, we have some sales ready. We feel really good about the upsell opportunity, pharmacy into our medical and selling that total value proposition. I look forward to working with my new colleague Jeff Walter and the Ingenio team on that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.

Appreciate your updated color around the mid-double-digit growth in the MA side of the business and I think in the past, you talked about the growth in telephonic sales. But I think did I say, expectations around our growth into digital channel. So, just any incremental color around that versus the telephonic channel and given COVID, do you have any thoughts or expectations around the level of planned switching with any of the plans as AEP? Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thank you very much for the question. Just real quickly, when we start with the planned switching, we do expect less switching this year as people are shopping less. We\u2019ve had a strong and growing amount of sales from our digital channels and we do think that that is going to be particularly strong. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Early returns are showing that already. Obviously, face-to-face during a time of COVID is a little more difficult. So, again, we are expecting a very strong \u2013 strong results as I shared in our opening comments around Medicare Advantage and digital will be a very big part of that. Thank you next question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Jones </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to the investment comments and just get a better sense about the investments not only for this year, but you highlighted a headwind from investments next year. So, I guess, maybe this year, just a $600 million in the business optimization charges that you had in the quarter. I know you cited areas like speed to market, streamlining operations, and then some of the digital initiatives it sounded like. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, maybe just a little bit more on those investments? And then in 2021, how, I guess, are those investments potentially different? What areas would they be focused in and anything around the size of those investments as you sit here today and think about next year would be really helpful. Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So I think there is two areas of the charge that I just want to make sure. One is around the reduction in the footprint, because we are reimagining our office space. And again, we are going to still be an office-based company and we will still have a presence in all of the states where we do business. But what we\u2019ve learned as part of the pandemic is that, we are really going to change the nature of those bases and consolidate the number of them we have in each of it, places that we work. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the investments we made, those are all very consistent with what we discussed back in Investor Day last year. And again, what we\u2019ve learned as part of the pandemic is an acceleration of both our ability to implement. So acceleration of digital that we\u2019ve been building, that needs a great examples, Psych Hubs and other ones, telehealth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All of those things we\u2019ve seen consumers much more readily adapt and use than we had even predicted and so part of that is accelerating that and how our workflows and business processes as part of what we\u2019ve been doing, we embarked on an initiative to really simplify our operating environment to improve experiences for consumers to take out redundant steps, improve how we reach out to consumers, use AI-enabled claim adjudication. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, things along that nature. Very consistent, but it\u2019s \u2013 again an acceleration that we see in usage pick up dramatically. So we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the work that we are doing. Thanks for the question and next question please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">George Hill </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning guys and thanks for taking the question. I guess, John, not a numbers question, but just interested in how you guys think about how if utilization mix continues to change, I guess, can you talk about how you guys think that reflects in pricing for 2021? And have you guys looked at current utilization kind of modeled that into the pricing for 2021? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, just kind of a nitpicking question, when you talked about the lower end of the range for 2021, was it your intention to basically tighten the range that\u2019s off the 13% growth. So we\u2019ll see a tighter EPS guidance range for next year as opposed to a wider range which could be 12% to 15%? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for the questions, George. I\u2019ll start with your last question first. Our long-term stated growth rate is still 12% to 15%. There is no intention of tightening that and we do believe that the 12% to 15% range is a sustainable range that we can deliver on for quite some time. The comment about being too lower end was just really due to an overabundance of caution, given the uncertainties related to the entire pandemic and COVID situation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Related to the utilization question at the beginning, we have done really a lot of sophisticated modeling. Our various scenarios that we modeled since the beginning of the crisis have been going on and we constantly updated and incorporate new learnings in the model as the pandemic is involved. The recovery in utilization maybe lumpy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do believe our assumptions are very sound. As I stated I think in an answer to an earlier question, there will be some natural system capacity constraint that we do believe will cause some utilization to naturally carryover into 2021. And just to be clear, yes, we have tried to think through all of those and incorporate all of those variables into our 2021 thought process. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, as I stated before, we are pricing the cover forward trend. And so, our expectation is, is that, that we will cover forward trends in terms of our pricing and our revenue associated with price differences. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Whit Mayo with UBS.

Good morning. What are you guys thinking about or sharing some [Indiscernible] at levels across all your lines of business this year. So, maybe instead of asking suspenders, what are the signposts that you are looking towards perhaps shift that policy? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thanks for the question, Whit. You know, as we think about policies, obviously, in our government business, that continues to be and I think part of the guideposts really are about and where we are in the pandemic and access to care. Right now, we are seeing offices open and we are seeing individuals to have access to care clearly as long as there is a serious issue on COVID and the pandemic. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we are seeing rise in cases. It\u2019s something that we continue to evaluate. There is a lot of uncertainties right now and a lot of questions. Timing into vaccine, expanded testing which we continue to model pent-up demand and we are seeing as we mentioned that going above the baseline. So we are seeing people access care, which is important. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And remember, our goal is also, we are reaching out to make sure that people have the right access to care particularly those we know who have multiple kind of conditions across our book of business. So, in terms of that, we continue to model it. We continue to look at it and our goal is to ensure that we have appropriate access to care. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that is, we are learning a lot more about each of the events that are happening with COVID. Thanks for the question and next one please? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Dave Styblo with Jefferies. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dave Styblo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi there. Thanks for the question. So, a quick clarification. John, when you talked about the MOR being 300 to 350 days at this point, above normal is sort of a fourth quarter of 18 a reasonable pocket to think about as a point of clarification. And then, second \u2013 the other question really is on Medicare Advantage. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You guys are talking about double-digit growth again more strong momentum. I guess, in past years, just the geographic expansion of your footprint has certainly helped that, as we look at the MA landscape file this period, it looks like you are only expanding by 1% or 2% of the senior population. So, I am just wondering what gives you confidence that you can sustain that momentum in terms of taking share from peers? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Dave. I\u2019ll answer the first half of the question associated with the MOR. Yes, the fourth quarter of 2018, of course doesn\u2019t need to be mix adjusted a bit for the fact that our membership mix has changed. But the fourth quarter of 2018 is as good of a starting point as any from a comparative basis to look at that 300, 350 basis point increase that I referenced. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the second question, why do we feel confident about our growth projections? There are few things. One, I shared in my opening comments, which is really very strong product offering. We expect 90 plus percent of our members to be in or have access to zero premium plans. Our supplemental benefits continue to be some of the strongest offerings in this space. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then third, we believe that there is still significant opportunity in our states to expand. I mean, right now, we don\u2019t have number one market share in many of those states and there is growth. We do have number one market share in the commercial space and our Blue brand is incredibly strong in those states. And then states where we are selling outside our Blue brand, we also are seeing some really nice momentum. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have partnerships and joint ventures with our Blue rather. And so, again, we are seeing a lot of momentum. Our brand resonates well. Our digital channels are also resonating very well in terms of the sales to marketplace. So, overall, while we don\u2019t have a significant \u2013 we have some expansion. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect to gain market share in our states and we do think that our 85 new counties that we\u2019ve entered will also help us. But again, we feel our offerings are very strong and are resonating quite well. Thank you. Next question please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Willoughby </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning. Just a quick question. I was wondering how you guys are thinking about cost of vaccines and therapies for COVID in 2021 in terms of essentially who is going to be paying for them and how much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thanks for the question. I think, while you are focused on vaccines, no one really has the ultimate answer at this stage, where we are watching the situation very closely and learning about the potential. We\u2019ve modeled a lot of scenarios into our pricing. There is a number of variables, obviously around vaccines including when they\u2019ll be available from as early as January, or is it summer of 2021. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Clearly, dosing requirements, vaccination rates, storage, transportation, whole lot of things. I mean, that obviously goes to say that there is a ton of variables. But remember, vaccines are only one cost of COVID in total. We are looking at the total cost of COVID and I wouldn\u2019t look at this into cancellation. Our goal obviously is to advocate to protect our highest risk members first. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, again that gets to the timing. But we also understand that CMS is going to be providing guidance at some point and we\u2019ll obviously look to follow their lead accordingly. Thank you. Next question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead. I apologize. Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gary Taylor </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning. A two-part question. Given the business optimization benefits are fairly material number, would you anticipate also excluding those from adjusted earnings guidance in 2021? The second part of the question, just wondering we looked the last four years share repurchases around between about $1.7 billion and $2 billion annualized \u2013 on an annualized basis. Would it be in that range again this year? Anything extraordinary contemplated there for either 4Q or 2021 in that 2021 outlook? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hey. Good morning, Gary. And thank you for the questions. Yes, first of all in the business optimization, we did certainly exclude the charge here in the third quarter. And the benefits associated with that will certainly come through over a period of years and become part of our runrate cost savings associated with the administrative structure of this company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, as we had talked about, we have got our plan to get to a 11% to 12% SG&amp;A ratio by 2023 that we have referenced at our Investor Day and this is certainly one step to get there. The other part of the question or the answer I would say is that, we\u2019ve also talked about incrementally investing really putting more money into the digital and AI, putting more money into the stars type of investments and we are obviously not going to exclude any of those cost from our numbers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, 2021, we think should be fairly clean from that perspective that we\u2019ll have some savings and we\u2019ll have some reinvestment opportunities to really help position the company much, much better for the future. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And I just like to reiterate too, it\u2019s a one-time charge. So just so we are clear about that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Gallina</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. This year, yes, thank you. And then, on the share repurchase, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately $1.3 billion through the end of September. We have a increased share repurchase pace a bit here in the third quarter, especially when our stock price was really down, we thought far greater than what it could or should have been based on a PE multiple perspective. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are obviously going to be opportunistic and watchful of market conditions. Our stated goal is to reinvest about 50% of our free cash flow into either M&amp;A or back into the business, 30% in the share buyback and 20% in the dividends. As I\u2019ve stated, I do believe that those buckets are going to be appropriate over a five year period of time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They will never be exactly correct in any one quarter. And probably not even exactly correct in any one full year. But I would expect that we would continue our share buyback here in the fourth quarter and maybe end the year little bit higher than what we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years, just given the weakness in the stock price that we saw. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then head into 2021 from there. But at the end of the day, we need to be opportunistic with our capital and ensure that it\u2019s being allocated appropriately. Thank you, Gary. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, John. I think we have time for one last question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our final question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Fidel </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks. Thanks for sending me in here under the wire. A question, I just wanted to circle back just on the Blues settlement. And I know it\u2019s early here in terms of how this ultimately may affect the broader Blues landscape. But just, answer - so Gail, I guess, two parts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One, do you think that ultimately this could lead to a renewal over time of the Blues consolidation theme, which obviously has been dormant for the last 15 years or so? And then also just from a strategy perspective, for Anthem, whether, the elimination of the Blues rules would lead you to think about doing larger non-Blues acquisitions over time? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gail Boudreaux</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thanks for the question, Scott. And, as I said before, our strategy, which we laid out at Investor Day has remained incredibly consistent. And so, we don\u2019t see this changing our strategy. We have significant opportunities to partner with Blues, as part of our diversified business group. We\u2019ve been very successful in selling in services and IngenioRx offers other opportunities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as you know, from our Medicaid and Medicare business, we\u2019ve done a number of partnerships with them well and recently Ingest announced actually a partnership in our group Medicare. So, I think, from our perspective, as I said before, I see \u2013 I really don\u2019t see this changing our stated strategy and I think that we are very excited about the growth prospects we have across Anthem. So, thanks very much for that question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. As we shared today, Anthem is not a blow path for growth across our enterprise driven by our commitment to deliver a simpler, more affordable, and more effective healthcare experience for those that we are privileged to serve. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As always, I want to express my gratitude to our associates for their unwavering commitment to our customers, members and communities during this most challenging time for our country. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see, we remain committed to delivering a simpler, more affordable and personalized experience for those we serve.
