Please see accompanying slides in the presentation for additional information.</p> <p>Today\u2019s discussion of our financial results will be presented on a<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release. This call is scheduled to last until 3\u2019o clock p.m. Pacific Time. As a reminder, the replay of this call will be available later this afternoon on our website.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, let me hand the call over to Martin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Martin Anstice</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Tina, and thank you all for joining us today. Lam delivered results stronger than targeted for the September quarter with revenues gross margin and EPS all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. In addition consistent with the commentary made during our last earnings call, we are forecasting the December quarter up sequentially and we would still characterize based on engagements with our customers in our markets and outlook for the first half of 2019 that is somewhat stronger than the second half of 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In aggregate there has been more semiconductor capital investment volatility both upside and downside in 2017 and 2018 than in the recent prior years and that is only extenuated by broader macro headlines such as trade, tariffs and interest rates. Despite this context, we remain very excited by the long-term drivers for data economy enablement from the world of silicon and the complements of our products and services portfolio to the technology roadmap of the industry. In our opinion, next generation device and systems architectures, the expansion of the materials in chip design and manufacturing creates compelling opportunities for our strength in etch and deposition. We remain committed to invest and innovate for the success of our customers and our company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As always the performance of Lam is defined by customer trust and employee commitments to our vision and values. We sincerely appreciate that partnership the opportunity created and the numerous contributions made. Since our July update, current year WFE expectations continue to track up slightly year-over-year although to a modestly reduced extent. At a segment level 2018, WFE looks a little stronger in logic, a little weaker in NAND and foundry to the assumptions we made three months back. With customer and Lam performance consistent with our December quarter revenue guidance provided today, calendar 2018 would represents a healthy revenue growth year of 14% for the company with profit performance marginally stronger versus the calendar year 2017 benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In deposition, we continue to see evidence of Lam\u2019s growing strategic relevance to the success of our customers with key penetrations of new films for patterning, new specialty applications for 3D NAND and deeper partnership models emerging for 3D NAND applications. In etch perhaps our most critical area of focus in 3D NAND is the continued enablement of customers increasingly challenging technology roadmaps where we continue to strengthen our leading capabilities in high aspect ratio applications. Our solutions are invested in customers\u2019 vision for continued 3D NAND scaling targeted to accelerate demand elasticity in their markets for the next several years. Combined etch and deposition market share penetration and defense activity is a net positive so far for Lam in calendar 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fundamental to the quality and sustainability of Lam earnings is the performance delivered by our Customer Support Business Group. Our installed base business has grown year-to-date at a pace more than two times faster than our installed base unit growth during the same period. Our worldwide process chamber counts now exceed 55,000 units compared to 36,000 units at the end of 2014 and this is the foundation for ongoing spares, service and upgrade revenues. We are increasingly focused on value creation for our customers through investments made in equipment intelligence products. We are providing performance enhancement in areas such as tool analytics, preventive maintenance and chamber matching to enhance productivity for our customers and create opportunity for Lam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition driven by our customers aspirations of better asset utilization in addressing the non-leading edge and also the emergence of new IoT and MEMS silicon opportunities, our reliance business recorded calendar year-to-date growth of more than 35% versus the same period in 2017, a good illustration we believe of Lam\u2019s ability to be flexible in addressing the full scope of our market opportunities. In closing, the September quarter and our outlook on December are largely as we shared with you last earnings call and should deliver more than $3 billion in cash from operations this year. We remain focused on investing in our profitable growth objectives at the same time delivering value through a balanced cash redistribution to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In this regard incorporating December 2018 quarter guidance provided today, year-over-year operating expenses increased by 9% with 75% of that growth focused on R&amp;D and our fully diluted quarterly share count reduces by approximately 10% end of year 2018 versus end of year 2017. We anticipate a healthy long-term opportunity for our customers and our company both with continued attention placed on strategies intended to deliver targeted returns on the investments that each market participant makes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Doug.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Bettinger</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you, Martin. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Lam executed well in the September quarter with our results exceeding the midpoint of guidance for all of our financial metrics. Operating margin and earnings per share were at the high end of the guidance range provided demonstrating what I think is discipline in our spending during a decline in industry capital equipment investments. We\u2019re pleased with our execution and ability to respond to the challenging business environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a reminder to everybody, we adopted ASC 606 in the September quarter, which is the first quarter of our 2019 fiscal year. Under 606 we generally record revenue at the time of shipment rather than at the time of customer acceptance. With this new standard, we are no longer providing shipment numbers. Our market segment disclosures will be based on the composition of our revenue numbers for the quarter and we\u2019ll do that now as well as into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let me get into that. Memory revenue continued to be strong with the combined memory segment making up 77% of total system revenue. Our overall non-volatile memory revenue remained strong representing approximately 51% of the system revenue and that\u2019s despite the anticipated reduction of spending in nearly every one of our NAND customers. DRAM represented 26% of system revenue. DRAM spending in the quarter continued to be focused on conversions to both the 1x and 1y nanometer node.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The foundry segment was stronger in the quarter accounting for 17% of system revenue. And finally, the logic and other segment contributed 6% of system revenue, pretty much consistent throughout calendar 2018. We continue to see strength in the China region with 25% of our revenue being generated there. The strength in China came from both foundry as well as memory. Nearly two thirds of the revenue in September came from domestic Chinese customers. We delivered revenues of $2,331 million in the September quarter, a decrease of 25% from June and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross margin for the quarter came in at 46.4%. And as we\u2019ve shared before, our actual gross are a function of several factors, such as business volumes, product mix and customer concentration and you should expect to see variability quarter-to-quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were down to $451 million, which was a decrease of $57 million from the June quarter. R&amp;D comprised nearly two thirds of our total spending consistent with the composition of the June quarter operating expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to maintain a higher concentration of spending in R&amp;D as we believe that discipline R&amp;D investments are critical to achieving our future revenue growth. One thing I\u2019d like to mention to help you with your future P&amp;L modeling. When we get to the March quarter of next year, we will have an extra work week in our fiscal quarter. This occurs approximately every six years due to our fiscal calendar cutoff. March spending will be higher as a result of the extra work week. So, keep that in mind as you put your March models together please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating income in the September quarter came in at $630 million. Operating margin came in at the top of the guidance range of 27% primarily due to stronger gross margin performance as well as flexibility in our spending in a quarter of lower business volumes. The non-GAAP tax rate for the September quarter was 11.9% in line with the guidance provided last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the longer run, tax rate in the low- to middle-teens is a right level to include in your models. And I will point out that you will see fluctuations around this quarter-to-quarter. Based on share count, we\u2019re approximately 165 million shares. Earnings per share for the September quarter were $3.36, again at the high end of a guided range. The primary driver of the upside versus our guidance was stronger profitability. The share count includes dilution from the 2041 convertible notes and the 2018 warrants that are still outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The total dilutive impact for each \u2013 for both of these, excuse me, was approximately eight million shares. And I\u2019ll remind you the dilution schedules for the remaining 2041 convertible notes is available on our Investor Relations website for your reference. In the September quarter, we had about $80 million in early conversions of the 2041 notes. Remaining balance of the 2041 notes is $248 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to execute on our capital return program. In the September quarter, we committed approximately $1.7 billion towards share repurchases deploying all of our current Board authorization from a dollar perspective. Our repurchases were executed largely through accelerated share repurchase programs that will cover repurchases until the March quarter of 2019. For dividends following the declaration of $1.10 per share the last quarter, we paid out $174 million in dividends to our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, decreased in the quarter to $3.9 billion and that compares with $5.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, the change largely due to our capital return activities. We continue to make progress bringing our cash on shore. Cash from operations for the September quarter remained strong at $720 million, which was roughly flat with the $718 million we generated in the June quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">DSO increased by nine days to 72 days, which is related to the linearity of revenue during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventory was roughly flat in dollar terms, while inventory turns declined to 2.7 times. This compares to 3.5 times in the prior quarter. We do expect to see turns improve in the December quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Company noncash expenses included approximately $50 million for equity comp, $36 million for amortization and $44 million for depreciation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Capital expenditures were $56 million, which was down from $80 million in the June quarter. For the calendar year, we expect CapEx in 2018 will be flat to slightly higher, compared to 2017 levels. CapEx this year is going towards investment in manufacturing expansion for our installed base business, as well as strategic R&amp;D investments. We exited the quarter with approximately 11,000 regular full time employees, which was relatively consistent with the June quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So now looking ahead, I\u2019d like to provide our non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We are expecting revenue of $2.5 billion plus or minus $150 million. We\u2019re expecting a modest uptick in customer spending across multiple segments, gross margin of 46% plus or minus one percentage point, operating margins of 27.5% plus or minus one percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $3.65 plus or minus $0.20 based on a share count of approximately 163 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consistent with our prior comments we forecast that September quarter marks a near-term trough for our business. While near-term forecasts are subject to change we remain optimistic on our longer term growth prospects that we highlighted during our investor event back in March. We continue to prioritize disciplined investments that drive competitively differentiated products, as well as Lam\u2019s out performance opportunity into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from C. J. Muse with Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C. J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first question is, as you think about your first half, outlook for calendar 2019 definitely coming in stronger, I think, than many of us thought. Can you walk through, I guess, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of tools versus service? And then if there\u2019s anything that we should be thinking about that is perhaps maybe Lam specific or timing of say image sensors coming in, we would love to kind of hear your thoughts on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes needless to say we\u2019re much more qualified to speak to our business than we are kind of like the overall kind of WFE headlines. So, when we think about kind of calendar 2019, obviously there has been some continuous, I would say, muting of investment expectations primarily in NAND flash since our last earnings call. We\u2019re looking at 14 new projects next year, fab projects next year. And I would expect honestly in the second half 2018 to first half 2019 comparison, that our revenue levels will be incrementally higher in DRAM logic other including image sensors to your points and also foundry. I would expect NAND to be down half, over half, second half 2018, compared to first half 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to the proportion of our kind of revenue headlines that is the spares and services, the installed base business, obviously it\u2019s a very important part of the economics of the company. And we\u2019ve given some color today on the pace of growth of that business by referencing the installed base and the annuity that comes with it and it\u2019s an important part of the value proposition here. But I would say our headlines for first half WFE are through the systems\u2019 headlines for the markets and the customers that we have. So hopefully that helps C. J.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C. J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very helpful. And if I could ask a follow-up, you\u2019ve always done a great job of managing OpEx. And given, I guess, the increased volatility Doug, how are you thinking about incremental margins from here? I think targeted model is roughly 40%. Is that still the right kind of model up or down depending on the revenue run rate?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well C. J. I think you rewrote our model. Our model is 32% to 33% in the longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes you see you\u2019re too used to C. J. these memory companies with 40% to 50% operating income, that it tainted you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C. J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But, C. J. to more directly ask you question, at these revenue levels kind of high 20s, you just saw us print 27 and guide 27.5, and as things recover and get stronger, you\u2019ll see us kind of inch our way towards that low 30s level. That\u2019s the right way to be thinking about things. There will be variability in spending. And one of the things I\u2019ve purposefully pointed out is the March quarter is a 14-week quarter, so there\u2019s an extra work week in there. And I\u2019ll remind you that in the first half of the year you get certain spending coming back in like payroll taxes and things like that. So don\u2019t forget those things as you\u2019re modeling the next couple of quarters. But hopefully that answered your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C. J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very helpful, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks C. J.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the solid results. I guess Doug my first question really kind of an accounting question around 606 and deferred revenue, there was a big draw down in the September quarter, sequentially in deferred revenue. How does that line sort of transition over time? Under 606 will that eventually get a zero? How quickly will you get there? And is there going to be uptick in December sort of revenue guidance, a function of just deferred revenue coming down off the balance sheet?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes so briefly I\u2019ll go through it John and you can ask me more if you to understand a little more. I mean basically what happened is we crossed into the new fiscal year is there was a bucket of deferred revenue that just fell straight to retained earnings. So that just fell off and is largely why our deferred revenue went down so much quarter-on-quarter. You\u2019ll continue to see deferred revenue though, John, for first of a kind tools, and certain BPA accrual type things that isn\u2019t completely delivered yet, it\u2019ll bounce around a little bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And generally the way I think about the difference between 605 and 606 is, it\u2019s all just timing. We\u2019re still shipping tools, we\u2019re still collecting cash, all of that is happening in the same timeframe that otherwise would have. In some quarters 606 revenue recognition will be higher than 605, in some quarters I would expect it\u2019ll flip and go the other way. But at the end of the day this is all just timing and what really matters in my mind is when cash is coming into the company and as I think you saw, we had a really strong cash collection quarter at $720 million. Does that help John?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful, it does. And then maybe for my follow-up to Martin, Martin, I think, one of the investor concerns out there is, as the industry transitioned from planer to 3D NAND and the rush to get there by your customers just created kind of a once in a lifetime type kind of bulge in NAND CapEx that\u2019s not repeatable. I\u2019m kind of curious as we go through this soft period in NAND, has your view of capital intensity, your SAM or the rate at which your customers are making these transitions changed. And are you still have the mindset that 32 to 64 was probably the most efficient transmission for the industry and as we go from here things get more difficult. Any color there would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean lot of questions here. So at a fundamental level no real change in our long-term outlook and that\u2019s a commentary on capital intensity needed for the industry. And we floated at $70 billion reference at the Flash Summit conference a year back, I think maybe repeated again this year actually, so two years in a row same message. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever really offered an opinion about efficiency of one node or another, but I would certainly align to the fact that\u2019s the challenges gets more complex over time as aspect ratios increase, which is a big part of the opportunity for us. That\u2019s where we\u2019re strong and differentiated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think that trends well. And we don\u2019t see the opportunity for 3D NAND as a once in a lifetime gig or a one time event, right? Clearly there were some transitional investments associated with playing a capacity to 3D, there are also investments associated with one generation 3D to next and we did a pine in earlier disclosure that over the next five years I think we expect about 1 million wafer starts per month of incremental capacity to get brought to the system associated with the long-term outlook for nonvolatile memory in this world of data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So from an industry point of view more or less the same. And I guess the one thing I didn\u2019t say is independent of what your view is, good or bad, you should recognize that the segments of action deposition are entirely central and fundamental to that transition. And so, if everybody does well or everybody has opportunity, we should have more and if nobody does so well we should outperform. So that\u2019s an important headline as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Helpful. Thanks guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Shankar with Cowen and Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Shankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Few of them, first one, Martin, if you look at this downturn clearly or this downdraft clearly led by memory. Looks like the CapEx for the WFE cuts have been in retaliation to pricing declines. So from your vantage point, do you think pricing is a key metric to look for to see when it trough and if so, do you think WFE trials for memory along with pricing? And do you have any view on when it\u2019ll happen? And I have a follow-up?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I mean, I think that\u2019s a very important question and quite a complicated one. Clearly there\u2019s a relationship of pricing to investment levels. And I would say that in two ways. The first one is, ASPs should reflect supply and demand balance of capacity. So to the extent the prices are going up or going down, there\u2019s an implied message around the need to add capacity or the needs to kind of reign in capacity. So, that\u2019s been the world we\u2019ve lived in for many, many, many years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What\u2019s a little different today is that pricing is not actually a great leading indicator right now of the customer\u2019s ability to afford to make investments. So back to my rather amusing response to Tim\u2019s earlier question, when the memory companies are making 40% to 50% profits when DRAM is $100 billion business, when flash has grown in the way that it has the sustainability of investments is clearly enabled in ways that wasn\u2019t true three or five years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now having said all of that, I think our customer spends money adding capacity when they have demand from their customers to ship devices. So I don\u2019t think people get carried away at any level these days. So it\u2019s a bit more complicated than it used to be. Pricing is relevant to help you understand supply and demand, but it\u2019s not so relevant in assessing sustainability and the customer\u2019s ability to make capacity or technology related investments. So good luck with your modeling, I guess.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Shankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, got it. That\u2019s really helpful, Martin. And then just a follow-up, clearly, everyone understand the long-term upside potential for Lam and the industry and WFE bond. I\u2019m just trying to frame the downside. If you look at the first shoot of drop with NAND followed by DRAM, do you worry that things will get worse before they get better? Or do you think they\u2019re kind of a dropping at these levels?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we are \u2013 if anything, we\u2019re super consistent, right? So my approach has always been to describe what I see and we\u2019ve done that. And we\u2019ll always do that. Good or bad, we\u2019ll tell how we see it. And so, we\u2019ve offered perspective that says December is stronger than September and we expect the first half of next year to be stronger than the second half of this year. And of course we might be wrong. And you have to kind of judge the confidence level of our disclosure and kind of move forward, I guess. So best I can offer you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Shankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks Martin. Thanks for the insight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Krish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks so much. I had two, I guess the first question Martin is, if I just hold your wafer fab equipment share and now I\u2019m putting everything in there. But if I just calculate your WFE share for this year and for the last year, it\u2019s up a little bit this year. So if I just hold that into the first half of next year, you\u2019re still annualizing if I give you say, $5 billion worth of revenue in the calendar first half, which was just up a little bit half on half, that would imply that we\u2019re still analyzing to like high 40\u2019s to close to $50 billion WFE. So, I guess the question is, who really knows about the calendar second half? But would you sort of endorse a number close to $50 billion for 2019 WFE?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Technically it\u2019s too early for us to answer that question. It\u2019s pretty customary that we have a response to that in the January earnings call. But fair question, I don\u2019t have the crystal ball, so I can\u2019t answer it with the same level of confidence, so I can answer the near-term questions. But a very interview question might be how do I feel today about the $100 billion two year reference that\u2019s been floated around for the last kind of few months. It\u2019s not a bad reference. We\u2019re trending a tweak below that right now to our analytics. But we\u2019ve trended a little above it at times and a little below and I can\u2019t really tell you what the variability is around it. But that would probably be the best I could give you at this point in time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Awesome. Thank you. And then Doug, it was a pretty big repo this quarter and I understand that it\u2019s going to sort of play out through the end of March. But I\u2019m curious if you can help us on share count for December and March as this kind of flows through. And then also how you think about when you\u2019re going to kind of re-up for the repo, how you kind of think about that? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I mean, Tim it\u2019s always an ongoing conversation at a board level. We described when we first launched this current authorization at 12 to 18 month timeframe, maybe we\u2019ve gotten through it a little sooner. I did purposefully point out that those ASRs are going to execute kind over a six month timeframe or not out of the market even though all the cash got deployed. When I have something to update you on, I\u2019ll update you relative to what we\u2019re going to do in the future. Obviously it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be talking about, but I don\u2019t have anything to tell you today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But just on the share count though, how it actually plays out, how it actually plays through for December and March. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I just guided you that December number of 163 million. I didn\u2019t give you anything for March and we only guide one quarter at a time, Tim, so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Awesome, Doug. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. We were at the Flash Memory Summit when the Lam team had its investor event and we also had the opportunity to hear from some of the existing NAND leaders in the market as well as some potential entrants from China who seemed to be making some progress and talked about increasing their manufacturing footprint next year. We\u2019ve also heard the same thing from some of the China domestic DRAM suppliers, albeit at lower levels of production activity. Do you think that China domestic memory starts to become a bigger part of your memory WFE mix looking into next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, probably does, Harlan, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Both NAND and DRAM, you think?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, probably. As you observed from Flash Memory, the NAND guys in China were a little more visible, maybe a little more confident there. But I think they\u2019re both going to increment\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I don\u2019t think our fundamental view on China is any different today than it was for the last couple of years. I mean, it\u2019s clearly an ambitious, but in our opinion, quite rational strategic agenda. And as each quarter passes there\u2019s more substance to what they\u2019re doing and we don\u2019t have anything more to add than what I think they\u2019re speaking to in the public markets on their. And obviously independent of all of that the long-term market participants are also investing for next-generation device architectures and market share growth and so on and so forth. So, I mean, it\u2019s a global system and that\u2019s what we respond to. But I think it\u2019s likely that the investment level in China increases in absolutes and proportional terms next year per Doug\u2019s response.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks. I just had a quick follow-up. It\u2019s pretty amazing, the amount of supply side, disciplined and focused on profitability and free cash flow by your memory customers and clearly they want to maintain strong profitability levels by modulating supply. If I look at the last time there was a strong focus on sort of reign in supply that was kind of 2016. It took about two quarters of strong equipment spending declines before we did see a positive response in memory placing fundamentals and economics for your customers. Is that how the Lam team still thinks about it as well i.e. that supply discipline in the second half of this year potentially positively impacts supply dynamics and maybe stronger possibility in the first half of next year for your customers?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wow. I\u2019m not showing that, but I\u2019ll answer that. I mean I would say everything moves faster. So, I think our customers adjust faster and therefore that\u2019s probably true on the upside as much as it is on the downside. We\u2019re a big part of feeding variability along with other market participants for the economics of their business. And I think they take actions anticipating risks as much as ever and that\u2019s a lot more than would be true five or 10 years ago when action would get taken when there was a clear problem statement. So yes, there are supply and demand imbalances that are getting adjusted too. There\u2019s also proactive actions to manage the risk of that. So that\u2019s a good thing I think in the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean it kind of gets to this \u2013 it gets to the message that the secular headlines for us feel like they\u2019re more important than stronger than the cyclical launch, but you have to make your own decision I guess.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Harlan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the insights.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Moore [Morgan Stanley].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you. Following up on that last question. I guess, I was surprised at how strong China was in the September quarter and I think you talked about two thirds of that being from domestics, that seems like a pretty big deviation. Is there anything we should be aware of there and how much of that is kind of memory versus you\u2019re sort of the foundry customers, who you\u2019ve seen more frequently?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean Joe, I\u2019ve pointed it out, because it was an uptick from the local guys and I want them to let you know that. I don\u2019t know you\u2019re going to see that every single quarter in fact, I know you won\u2019t. And interestingly, when I look at kind of who the customers are, and I won\u2019t name them by name that there was relative balance between foundry as well as memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And logic actually\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually in logic, you\u2019re right, Martin. So, it was \u2013 it was a strong quarter for us in China and it was a balanced quarter. I mean, my take on this thing answer is, we tend to talk about collectively two or three \u2013 two or three core domestic participants in China. Reality is, there are kind of six or seven.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, there\u2019s more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And some of them are active at 300, some of them are interactive at 200 millimeter, some of them are active at leading edge technologies and some less leading edge, but there\u2019s a fairly meaningful population that doesn\u2019t maybe get fully internalized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Joe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Romit Shah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. I guess just, as outsiders that all the data points on memory equipment CapEx and fundamentals to seemingly seemed all bad during the quarter and yet you exhausted your entire buyback and you\u2019re reiterating your expectations for growth in December. So, is it fair Martin, just to sort of sum up this report by saying that maybe, your business is more diversified than we realized and you\u2019re confident in September being the bottom. And the question really is just sort of the shape of the recovery from here being either U or V-shaped?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think we\u2019ve been talking to the subject of diversification now for, it\u2019s kind of three or four years. No question we\u2019re more diversified today than we were. I think we\u2019ve tried to reinforce that message even more than talking about share gains in foundry and share gains in logic by speaking to the SAM expansion headlines. And in the last kind of the year or so, we\u2019ve segwayed into the installed base business of the company, which is not only a great asset relative to creating an opportunity for competitive differentiation in the core systems products of the company, it\u2019s a source of revenue and profit growth at a rate that is faster than the pace of growing our installed base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean there\u2019s a massive difference between 55,000 process chambers and 36,000 process chambers relative to the annuity. So that\u2019s all kind of in the mix as well. So, the business is more or less as we had anticipated slightly muted to the expectations of three months ago. But not that much different, I mean, I actually think our calendar 18 WFE number is 98% or 99% exactly what it was three months ago. So, I mean, that\u2019s kind of basic headline there and we\u2019ve expressed an outlook for the first half of next year and we\u2019re not going to put numbers on it now. We\u2019ll kind of deal with that in January. So that will be the time when we or you become some obvious disclosure from the Lam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Romit Shah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. thanks for that. And just on the buyback you\u2019ve exhausted it. So do we have to wait till the next conference call to hear about the size and scope of the next authorization?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, even though the cash like I said, Romit, the cash got all committed. We\u2019re still in the market through these structured products, so\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Romit Shah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that was purposeful, right, taken a view of pricing, where things were at and wanting to get on with it. But the way this generally works is Martin and I all agree, here is what we think we should do. We\u2019ll go on and we\u2019ll have a conversation with the board and the board will have opinions. So, we\u2019ll modify it and when we have a decision, we will communicate it to you and we\u2019re not at that point yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Romit Shah</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Romit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. Martin, maybe a question on your services business. If say, hypothetically WFE goes down 5% or 10% next year, what does that imply for your services business? Can you still keep it flat or even grow it? Just what is just the conceptual sensitivity to WFE?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, in the calendar year, there\u2019s not so much sensitivity, because in general, when we ship a system to customer, it has a 12-month warranty, so it\u2019s kind of on our dime during that period. The single biggest influence over the size of the installed base businesses, the number of kind of units in the installed base for which we disclosed and then the utilization of fabs. So if you \u2013 if we show up in the worlds with the WFE reduction that you\u2019ve just characterized and there is no change in utilization of the installed base, then there\u2019s no consequence. If the utilization of the installed base goes up, you\u2019re likely to see accelerated growth and if the installed base utilization goes down, you see a contraction and spares of service business in the industry. So, our assumption is in the context of customers have done a really good job kind of managing this issue, utilizations will run pretty high and we have no reason to be anxious about a dip in our installed base revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In an independent world, as spoken to you for some time now, a little bit here today in prepared comments, we are perpetually building a portfolio of installed base productivity related products and service offerings and invested in contributing more to the success of our customers and creating opportunity for Lam. So, there\u2019s some things in our control and some things that are out of our control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And as a follow-up from what you see today, do you think memory CapEx overall is up or down next year and when do you typically get visibility around what the spending environment will be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfectly normal timing where it will give you more color on next year would be in next quarter\u2019s earnings call. It\u2019s just a little bit too early for us to give on the specificity you\u2019re asking for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you so much. Martin, you\u2019ve talked about logic revenue being up in the first half of 2019 relative to the second half of 2018. Is the big driver there basically your key customers CapEx budget going up or is it more due to your positioning improving from say 14 to 10 nanometer or is it both?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a little bit of both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then kind of related to that, if you were to \u2013 in terms of magnitude, you guided DRAM, logic and foundry all power for over half. If you had to rank order those three in terms of the magnitude increase from the second half to the first half, is that something that you guys can do?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I haven\u2019t written down on a piece of paper in front of me and now decided like that \u2013 I\u2019d like to tell you. So, rank order without any numbers, I would say logic and it\u2019s kind of other logic, which includes, the image sensor opportunities and the legacy stuff, it\u2019s probably the fastest-growing. And DRAM is the slowest-growing and foundries probably in the middle. That would be kind of \u2013 and I\u2019m not speaking to kind of industry level here, I\u2019m just characterizing the revenue kind of outlook for Lam, and as I said, NAND\u2019s contractions, so that will be our rank order.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It\u2019s like pretty early to be having those conversations. So, take it for what it\u2019s worth at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. As a quick follow-up, I just had a question on market share. Martin, clearly, if you\u2019re growing your business 14% this year, you\u2019re gaining a bit of share. In your prepared remarks, you\u2019ve talked about some of your net wins, both in dep and etch. Is it fair to say in relation to your long-term model, where you\u2019ve attached $1 billion incremental revenue for market share gains? Are you tracking in line or ahead of that plan or how would you describe, where you stand today relative to the long-term plans?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Was never linear as it\u2019s a tough question to answer. But a couple of data points. So, when we talk about kind of penetration defense activities this year, we\u2019re actually talking more about the economics that will play out a year from now or maybe even in 2020, right, because there\u2019s a leading a timeframe on DTOR decisions and PTOR decisions and you might remember that in the last earnings call, I think I made referenced to the fact that there were tons of decisions in relative terms in the second half of this year compared to the first half of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that\u2019s kind of a loss still ahead of us. So, fair game for you to ask the same question to me to try and answer it in January. So far, again, we don\u2019t \u2013 we never think though that we defend everything, but we have a net positive to forward-looking kind of economics from the penetrations and defenses in the first nine months of this year. So pretty, pretty pleased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Toshiya.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Ho with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Martin, first off, just I guess follow-up on some of your comments on named capital intensity, but looking at it from the DRAM front, as the industry continues to push the 1X, 1Y, eventually to 1Z, we\u2019re seeing a lot of new fab projects in DRAM. Do you believe these capital intensity trends are also impacting DRAM and this could provide a little bit of, I guess, sustainability on some of the equipment spending trends that we\u2019re seeing today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s all about kind of the economics on the revenue of the customer honestly. I think what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is, obviously, an emergence of significant discipline, managing supply and demand, and there has been an ASP consequence, but more than that, we\u2019ve seen a transition away from units to content and density in a broader set of demand drivers. And that has allowed our customers to kind of reset the value of the bits that they\u2019re selling to their customers. So, the average bit is worth kind of more by virtue of the value that\u2019s created in this kind of broader cognitive computing environments. And so if there continues to be discipline and if our customers continue to be successful getting paid for the enabled ones in their industry, the fact that from one generation to the next, the DRAM cost transitions are kind of less significant compared to the baseline of five to 10 years ago. It\u2019s much less relevance, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean clearly when no transitions deliver less than they did in history, there\u2019s a lot of intensity by the customer and there\u2019s a lot of intensity by Lam and our peer companies. I\u2019m sure to try and continue to improve the productivity of the DRAM installed base, because we have a collective interest in that. But I think the bigger question to answer relative to DRAM capital intensity is the revenue side of it, not the cost side of it. But as I said three times today, in my \u2013 go ahead?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As my follow-up question for Doug, in terms of the services and spare parts business, you mentioned that you have a little bit of the CapEx spend; the increase is incrementally going into that business segment. How much can you leverage, I guess your existing workforce in terms of growing that business on the labor side of things, or is that an area where you\u2019ll also have to increase OpEx to keep up with the fast pace of growth in that business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Patrick, it\u2019s a different physical factor in a different location. So, there\u2019s not a lot of leverage from a labor standpoint and we have to invest in manufacturing, the parts for manufacturing. So, it\u2019s all goodness at the end of the day, it\u2019s supporting a higher installed base and we got to make investments for that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Patrick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one on kind of nano-secular technology. Is there any of your customers that have already started working on that or is that something that it\u2019s told to come next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Unfortunately, our customers have to answer that question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Got it. And then secondly, on the DRAM side, do you guys see any, I guess \u2013 I guess, when would you guys think that the pricing would stabilize in DRAM in general, or do you guys have no view right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we have a view, but I think the view of our customers again, is worth a lot more than ours. I mean it\u2019s all about supply and demand, and our customers have taken action, I would argue proactively as much as reactively. And so everything moves pretty fast these days. So again, customer\u2019s disclosure is worth a lot more than ours on ASPs of devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mitch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Weston Twigg with KeyBanc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Weston Twigg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First, I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any change in customer behavior related to trade work insurance whether that\u2019s in terms of the conversations you\u2019re having with them or the visibility that they\u2019re providing or commitments regarding new fab capacity heading into 2019. Any color would be helpful?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. To the best of my knowledge, nothing\u2019s really changing directly related to that, although I\u2019ve kind of heard a few statements and read a few things quoted about customers\u2019 kind of referencing terrorists or the costs of terrorists when it comes to the pace at which they\u2019re making investments. In fact, I think I read one today out of Taiwan. So, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not irrelevant. I mean, to the extent that a company has more of costs, because of terrorists and we probably all do at some level. There is a consequence of that and there is a reprioritization of things in the company. So, not irrelevance, but hard for us to kind of directly correlates. I\u2019m just conscious that I\u2019m seeing statements and I\u2019m hearing some things. And so it\u2019s in the mix of the outlook that we\u2019ve described today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Weston Twigg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then my follow-up question is just on DRAM strength in the first half that you mentioned, is there a strength from \u2013 more from some of the pushouts you\u2019re seeing from this half, is it related to new capacity or is it more just ongoing conversion activity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s mostly as originally planned. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive kind of statements. So, there are not so many industry participants in any segment these days. So, you probably got a sense of who is chasing who and who is investing where for what purpose. So, I think it was pretty much originally as consistent with plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Weston Twigg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Weston.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tina Correia</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in. Doug, going back to your commentary by the extra week in the march quarter, which is leading to higher expenses, should I also assume that your revenue would be positively impacted for an extra week?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, technically we have an extra week to shift product, Mehdi, I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to meaningfully move the revenue number. I do know definitively, it will impact the expenses. we\u2019ll give you the hard guide when we did get the end of the quarter though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just \u2013 I just want to go back to your comment about the deferred revenue. And if I just do a simple math, I get to shipment down 35% on a sequential basis. Is that \u2013 does that make sense to you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mehdi, we\u2019re not getting shipment anymore. We\u2019re not talking about shipment anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. this is for the September quarter. This is for the September quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, yes. We\u2019re done talking about shipments publicly; revenue is all we\u2019re going to be describing now. You can do analytics on whatever you want to get shipments, but at the end of the day, given the change in the revenue recognition timing, revenue is what we\u2019re going to be talking about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s great. Just a follow-up on your services, given the increased installed system, are these service contracts long enough to actually have an impact on your backlog? Does that help you with better visibility?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, if that\u2019s the case and assuming that services is becoming a larger part of your revenue mix, why not offer a longer guide on the revenues rather than just referring to WFE?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll think about it, Mehdi. I mean at the end of the day, we tried to describe what we think is important for you to understand what\u2019s going on in the business. There\u2019s still just a large amount of the business in any one quarter that\u2019s turns based. And to me, backlog isn\u2019t that meaningful, for services, it\u2019s certainly as just Martin said. So, we\u2019ll give you some thought.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Because just the growth in installed system is very compelling, but it still hasn\u2019t made a difference to how you guide and I\u2019m just wondering what is the disconnect here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Anstice</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m not \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually true. I think for the last couple of quarters you have perspective some times quantitative and some times qualitative on the progression for a couple of quarters including today. So, it\u2019s pretty hard to do what we\u2019re doing and as many people characterize that we don\u2019t have the visibility to say what we currently say as those to do. So take it for what it\u2019s worth, we\u2019re doing the best we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Mehdi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mehdi Hosseini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And speakers, as we have no more questions, I\u2019ll turn it back to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Martin Anstice</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.
