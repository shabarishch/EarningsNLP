Calendar 2021 was another year in which companies and our communities had to respond to significant challenges on many fronts. Lam\u2019s operations and results were impacted by the effects of COVID-19, labor shortages, freight and logistics cost escalation and supply chain constraints. But I am proud and thankful for how Lam employees responded at every turn with commitment and agility to support our customers and business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the digital transformation of both the global economy and our everyday activities accelerated throughout the year, demand for wafer fabrication equipment continued to strengthen. Lam delivered record revenues and record earnings per share in calendar year 2021. Embedded in these results is record revenue in every area of our business, including NAND, DRAM and foundry logic and within every sub-segment of our customer support business. Even in a year with relatively higher foundry logic spend versus memory, we gained market share in both etch and deposition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we closed out 2021 and enter the new year, demand for Lam products has never been higher. Yet as we have discussed in prior quarters, the global supply chain remains severely stressed at these unprecedented output levels. In the December quarter, unexpected shipment delays primarily for components from a critical supplier surfaced in the last two weeks of the quarter leaving us with insufficient time for full recovery despite the diligent efforts of our supplier and our global operations team. The resulting shipment delays caused revenues to come in below the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue for the tools that were impacted in December will be recognized in the March quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking into the first weeks of 2022, we see that supply challenges have broadened with the COVID Omicron surge adding further disruption to freight and logistics operations as well as exacerbating skilled labor shortages. We also continued to encounter significant scarcity of certain components and parts, including semiconductors. As a result, our March quarter revenue levels will be limited by the output constraints of our global supply chain. And this is reflected in our guidance. We are aggressively working on the issues with our suppliers and believe we will see progressive improvement as we move through the next few quarters. Overall, for calendar year 2022, we expect to deliver strong across-the-board revenue growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the demand front, we are seeing continued momentum in wafer fabrication equipment spending. We believe that spending in calendar year 2021 ended consistent with the mid-$80 billion estimate we provided on our last call. Strength was broad-based with NAND, DRAM and foundry logic all growing double-digits. As we look to calendar year 2022, there are multiple themes underpinning our view for continued WFE growth, including powerful end market demand trends, rising device complexity, strong semiconductor industry operating profitability and regional government support and incentives. In end markets, the technology landscape continues to build not only on the prevalent drivers of AI, IoT, the cloud and 5G, but also now along another vector as advances in virtual and augmented reality lay the groundwork for the metaverse over the coming decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Immersive gaming experiences will be a primary driver of metaverse development and adoption. And I have spoken on prior calls about how advanced processors and memory devices for gaming are favorable for WFE demand due to both leading edge performance requirements and semiconductor content growth. Across the semiconductor industry, we see more than 20 new fabs being built and customers have already announced significant CapEx increases for the year. Consequently, we expect 2022 WFE spending to be in the $100 billion range with strong growth across all segments. We believe that our performance in 2021 has strengthened our ability to win in the robust demand environment we see ahead. We launched innovative new etch and deposition products, gained market share at key technology inflections, and rapidly grew our installed base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On this last point, our customer support business group continues to exceed expectations. Our chamber count grew approximately 13% in calendar year 2021 to approximately 75,000 units. Our revenue per chamber, which we highlighted at our 2020 Investor Day as a key growth objective, increased nearly 24% year-on-year in 2021, or nearly twice the growth in chamber count. We expect calendar year 2022 to be another strong growth year for our CSBG business. Our large and growing installed base also adds immense value through our product innovation process. The high volume of wafers running on our installed base everyday enable us to detect newly emerging challenges more quickly and accelerate our cycles of learning, both of which are critical in an era of increasing device and manufacturing complexity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the product front, 2021 was a year of significant milestones for Lam. To highlight just a few, our Vantex dielectric etch system became the fastest ramping new etch product in Lam history. Built on our groundbreaking new Sense.i platform, Vantex helps customers reduce costs by enabling higher etch rates and improving fab footprint efficiency, while new process capabilities extend our technology leadership in high aspect ratio edge. We expect continued growth in Vantex shipments in 2022, with overall revenues from this product roughly doubling year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our VECTOR DT product for backside deposition, achieved process tool of record status at all customers for 3D NAND devices with more than 200 layers further demonstrating our leadership in 3D scaling enablement. We achieved several important leading-edge wins with our selective etch, strip and surface treatment solutions, including applications for gate-all-around and foundry logic customer and our first selective etch win in DRAM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As device complexity increases across logic and memory devices, the need for angstrom-level precision is driving greater adoption of Lam\u2019s selective edge solutions compared to conventional wet etch methods. This should enable selective etch revenues to double this year as customers adopt our innovative suite of products for current leading edge applications as well as for future device architectures. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, we increased our deposition market share with wins in critical bit line and spacer applications for RC reduction and are now qualified at all leading nodes for this application.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To conclude, our product momentum and outperformance in our installed base business have put Lam in a great position to capitalize on the tremendous demand we see for wafer fabrication equipment. Our top priority is to alleviate the near-term supply constraints that have impacted our output capacity, our delivery predictability and our financial results. With progress expected on this front over the next several months, we believe calendar year 2022 will be another outstanding period of growth for Lam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And now, he is Doug to cover the financial results and our outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug Bettinger</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining our call today during what I know is a very busy earnings season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Calendar year 2021 was a record year for Lam Research in many respects. We closed the year with revenue at $16.5 billion, which includes record levels of revenue for both our systems as well as our CSBG businesses. We also delivered an all-time high for earnings per share coming in at $32.46. I think it\u2019s important to point out that we had 59% growth in earnings per share over calendar year 2020, which outpaced the growth in revenue, which was at 39%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the year however on a bit of a down point. As Tim spoke about, our revenue came in at the lower end of the guidance range due to supply chain issues that impacted us in the last two weeks of the December quarter. These delays primarily from one supplier for critical parts meant we were unable to recognize revenue for tools that we actually ship to customers, totaling more than $200 million. You will notice this reflected in the increased level of deferred revenue on the balance sheet at the end of the December quarter of $1.46 billion. The vast majority of these parts have now shipped and the full value of the tools, will revenue in the March quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we continue to increase the output capacity of our own factories, we are seeing a broadening out of headwinds from the global supply chain, which is impacting the somewhat soft March quarter revenue and gross margin guidance. These headwinds are partially Omicron and labor-related, partially supplier scaling-related and partially due to freight and logistics constraints. Our expectations are that the broader supply chain issues in the industry will persist for a while and will exit the March quarter with incremental supplier shipment delays potentially causing another growth of as much as $500 million in deferred revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would just highlight that we often ship equipment to our customers on a modular basis, which accelerates deliveries and allows customers the ability to begin installation while waiting for the fully configured tool. As we get our suppliers caught up with our needs and these missing components ship, these tools will revenue in future quarters. This is obviously a fluid situation right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me now turn towards the details of our December quarter results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.23 billion, a slight decrease from the September quarter, but an increase of 22% from the same quarter a year ago. From a segment perspective, Memory represented 58% of systems revenues in the December quarter, down from the prior quarter level, which was 64%. The strength in Memory during the quarter was driven by investments in the DRAM segment, which increased both in terms of dollars as well as percent concentration at 23% of systems revenue versus 19% in the September quarter and 10% in the June quarter. The DRAM investments were primarily focused on the 1z and 1-alpha nodes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The NAND segment was 35% of our systems revenue versus 45% in the prior quarter. We are seeing both capacity additions as well as conversions across our NAND customers, with investments in 128 through 192-layer devices. We expect we will continue to see a blend of additions and conversions as we go through calendar year 2022. Broad demand across both leading edge and mature device nodes drove continued strength in the foundry segment, with the December quarter representing 31% of our systems revenue versus 25% in the September quarter. Multiple customers are investing in the segment to meet end demand drivers such as AI, IoT, cloud and 5G, which is leading to significant unit growth and more silicon content in most technology devices. We had another record quarter of system revenue dollars in the Logic and Other segment, which contributed 11% of systems revenue in the December quarter, which was consistent with the concentration in the prior quarter. Our customers are investing to meet the demand requirements in the market for microprocessors, image sensors and heterogeneous silicon packaging technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s switch to the regional composition of our total revenue. The China region came in at 26% of total revenues. And while being the top region for December, it was down from the 30% plus levels we have seen for the last few quarters. This was an expected outcome and is related to the timing of customer investments. China domestic customers were the majority of the China regional revenue in the December quarter. The Korea and Taiwan regions also had solid investment activity, representing 25% and 18% of revenues respectively in the December quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The revenue for our installed base business, CSBG, was nearly $1.5 billion, which was 29% higher than the December quarter in calendar 2020 and approximately 8% higher sequentially. The continued strength of CSBG reflects a growing installed base of tools, customers operating at high utilization levels as well as our ability to monetize the growing installed base by offering more value-added advanced service solutions. Each sub-segment of CSBG hit a new record in the quarter, but I want to specifically callout our Reliant product line for achieving its 12th consecutive record quarter, delivering value to a growing specialty market across numerous customers. While the CSBG business can have quarterly fluctuations, we continue to see sustained and stable growth on an annual basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, moving on to gross margin, the December quarter was 46.8%, above the midpoint of the guided range. The increase in gross margins came from a favorable customer and product mix due to shipment timing as well as high field resource productivity due to greater customer installation activity. As we have discussed in the past, gross margins can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to overall business levels, along with customer and product mix. And I would just mention, we have got incremental negative cost impacts from the supply chain constraints that we discussed earlier that are negatively impacting the March gross margin guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating expenses for December were $627 million, an increase from the prior quarter amount of $586 million. The December quarter had higher variable compensation as we closed the calendar year as well as additional research and development investments. We have added headcount in R&amp;D to support our growing product portfolio and we are focused on supporting our customers\u2019 ongoing technology roadmaps. December operating margin came in at 32% or approximately $1.4 billion. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 11.9%, generally in line with our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking into calendar year \u201822, we expect the ongoing tax rate to be in the low-teens level. We continue to monitor potential tax changes under consideration in the United States. Given the uncertainty there, we have not yet reflected the impact of any changes in our financial modeling. And as we have discussed in prior calls, our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Other income and expense came in for the quarter at $19 million in income. This amount is better than the prior quarter and resulted in income in the December quarter due to a gain in one of our venture investments that recently raised capital in a public offering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we have noted in last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we did not include the estimated gain of approximately $50 million in our December quarter guidance and the amount in the results that you are seeing was reasonably close to that forecast. This gain added 26% \u2013 or excuse me $0.26 tax adjusted to earnings per share. And I just have you note that overall OI&amp;E is subject to market-related volatility that could cause a difference from our typical run-rate. We continue to buyback shares with our focus on capital return. And in the December quarter, we repurchased approximately $430 million worth of stock. In addition, we paid $211 million in dividends during the quarter. For the calendar year, we allocated a total of $3.8 billion towards capital return, which was approximately 94% of free cash flow. During 2021, we reduced share count by more than 4 million shares at an average repurchase price of $593 per share. Diluted earnings per share for the December quarter was $8.53. And the diluted share comp balance was slightly lower than the September quarter level coming in at 142 million shares, which was in line with our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me now shift to the balance sheet. Cash and short-term investments, including restricted cash, totaled $5.6 billion, up from the prior quarter level of $4.9 billion. We generated strong cash from operations in the December quarter of $1.4 billion, which was somewhat offset by the capital return activities that I just spoke about. Day sales outstanding was essentially flat coming in at 73 days compared to 72 days in the September quarter. Inventory turns were down slightly from the prior quarter level coming in at 2.9x, which was pretty much as planned as we\u2019ve grown inventory to increase the business volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-cash expenses for the December quarter included approximately $63 million for equity compensation, $62 million for depreciation and $20 million in amortization. Capital expenditures in the December quarter were flat with September coming in at $138 million. Capital expenditures are mainly focused on expansion activities such as our silicon parts facility in Ohio and the Korea Technology Center that will be opening in the first half of 2022. We have 16,300 regular full-time employees at the December quarter \u2013 at the end of the December quarter, which is an increase of approximately 900 people from the prior quarter. Our headcount growth was mainly in the factory and field organizations to support the growing output levels that we\u2019re seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s look at our non-GAAP guidance for the March 2022 quarter. We\u2019re expecting revenue of $4.25 billion, plus or minus $300 million. As we\u2019ve discussed earlier, the guidance reflects our expectation for a higher level of shipment delays in the March quarter, due to broadening out of supply chain constraints we\u2019re seeing. Customer demand is decently stronger than what we can currently supply. Backlog has grown for five consecutive quarters as we exited the December quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re expecting gross margin of 45%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Our guidance reflects a higher level of spending that we\u2019re incurring for managing the execution of the supply chain as well as extra costs to secure critical semiconductor component parts. As we sit here today, I believe our gross margin will improve as we progress through the year. We\u2019re forecasting operating margins of 29.5%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. And finally, earnings per share of $7.45 plus or minus $0.75 based on a share count of approximately 141 million shares. We\u2019re widening our ranges out a bit due to the supply chain uncertainties that we\u2019ve discussed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we start calendar year 2022, we\u2019re in the strongest investment year in the history of the semiconductor industry. It\u2019s important to note that the demand is clearly there. We are dealing with broadening out of supply chain constraints, which we know we\u2019re going to fix over time. We\u2019re laser-focused on addressing these supply challenges, and we\u2019re confident that we will deliver improvements as we go through the year. We\u2019re in solid market share positions. We\u2019ve gained further traction across all market segments in 2021. And we\u2019ve got a robust and growing installed base business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, that concludes Tim and my prepared remarks. We\u2019d like to now open up the call for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So can you guys just help us understand on the supply chain constraints? Is this more subsystems and part shortages or is it chip shortages? And I assume that you\u2019re placing orders for both subsystems, parts and ships to the entirety of this year just given the extended lead times. So looking at what your suppliers have committed to shipping to you this year, if all of this plays out, combined with the incremental systems capacity expansion from Malaysia, can the team meet its forward backlog and forecasted customer requirements this year or do you think that there is some likelihood that you exit this calendar year with your shipments below your customers\u2019 demand requirements?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Harlan, I\u2019ll start that and let Doug add if he wants to. As we mentioned, the December issue was primarily critical parts that you call them \u2013 I\u2019ve called them probably subsystems, pretty large critical components that goes into our tool. But the underlying reasons for why certain suppliers are having challenges, shipping goes across the board. We talked about broadening challenges. In some cases, it\u2019s shortages of labor that have been driven and exacerbated by COVID-driven absenteeism. In some cases, it\u2019s chip availability. In some cases, it has been freight and logistics. But I would say that we are working closely with these suppliers, and we have committed schedules. We\u2019ve said our lead times are quite extended versus normal. We have better visibility today into demand and customer schedules, I think, than we ever have. And therefore, to your point, we have placed those orders with suppliers. And I would say in both Lam\u2019s case and our suppliers case, it\u2019s about executing to that much higher demand plan. Now what we\u2019ve given you as an outlook for WFE that we do believe we can execute to. And as we said, we believe we will make progressive improvement in supply chain capacity in coming quarters. And that as we do that, you\u2019ll see Lam output, the output of our supply chain increase and we will be meeting the customer demand at that point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What I would also point out is that from the standpoint of our own capacity. This was a key area of focus in 2021, and we talked a lot about it. We significantly expanded our existing factories in the U.S., in Korea, in Taiwan. We ramped and started shipping from our new Malaysia facility, which ultimately will become our largest manufacturing site. We increased our own employment both in full-time and temporary workforce. And I would say, right now, our focus is ensuring that every aspect of our supplier base has grown their capacity to match ours. And that is something that we\u2019re working on every day, and I do believe we will \u2013 as Doug said, we \u2013 this is a fixable problem, but it is our primary priority at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe the only thing I would add just so it\u2019s crystal clear to everybody listening, the December slight miss below midpoint, really one supplier that emerged very late in the month of December. And we just didn\u2019t have time to respond to it. So that\u2019s one statement. Second, what Tim just told you is there is a broadening out that we see beyond one supplier that we\u2019re working to mitigate. And we\u2019re doing lots of different things with lots of different suppliers to work our way through this, Harlan, but we know we\u2019re going to fix this. This is something that you can manage your way through, and we will manage our way through it. Demand is very strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe just a final comment to note, obviously, on everybody\u2019s mind is that we were fighting challenges all through 2020. I mean, it\u2019s not as though supply chain has just become an issue. But I would say that some of the things that have changed when we talk about the slight worsening that we\u2019re seeing right now is also that in many cases, whether it\u2019s Lam\u2019s inventory or suppliers\u2019 inventory they have been drawn down by these very high output levels to the point where our vulnerability to a miss that might only be just a few days, but at the output rate of our factories. Those few days can actually translate into some pretty big revenue numbers, and that corresponding few days could be the same for our suppliers. So I think that what\u2019s different right now is that we just have a little bit less room to respond to the challenges. But I tell you, all through 2021, we are fighting these and in almost all cases, we were successful in mitigating them without them becoming misses in our financial results. But I think that \u2013 and that\u2019s what gives us confidence that we will solve these as we go through \u201822 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I appreciate the insights. Then can you just \u2013 given the strong WFE backdrop and the potential strong growth backdrop for Lam. Can you guys just give us an update on the Malaysia manufacturing ramp? I believe that the target was to get to about $3 billion of annualized revenue output from Malaysia by the middle of this year. Is the team still on track for that? And I\u2019ve also heard that the team is trying to build out domestic supplier support around this facility, which is potentially a big benefit for you guys, right, especially during periods like this where having to procure materials from other geographies can probably be quite challenging. So maybe you can also update us here on the strategy for building out the domestic support capability in Penang?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, what I would say is that the ramp of the Malaysia factory is on track. And we\u2019re quite happy with the progress we\u2019re making there. Again, it\u2019s ramping per schedule. Demand is somewhat outstripping the ramp rate. But coming back to your point about why we embarked on Malaysia and also expansions, as I mentioned, in Korea, Taiwan, the U.S. and even in our factory in Europe. And that is we get the opportunity to tap into different talent pools. So I talked about labor shortages, not all COVID-related. These are just driven by serving demand in lots of parts of the industry. So by having factories in different locations, we tap into different talent pools. And also, as you mentioned, we have the opportunity to qualify different supplier sets or even in some cases where we have global critical suppliers, they built factories in those same locations next door to us very close to our site. And they also tap into that different talent pool. And so there is many ways in which this expansion of our global footprint, we think in the long-term, actually makes us less sensitive to disruption in any one particular region, whether it\u2019s in freight and logistics or it\u2019s in workforce or it\u2019s in the supply chain. So it\u2019s all part of our strategy. We\u2019re executing on it and we just need to get to that endpoint a little bit faster. Thanks, Harlan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Yes, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we will go to our next question from Krish Sankar of Cowen &amp; Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. Doug and Tim, you mentioned the WFE to be $100 billion this year. But if I look at the current WFE run rate, it seems like it\u2019s like more in the low to mid-$90 billion. So to get to $100 billion, the second half run rate has to be more like $105 billion to $110 billion. And I understand the demand is strong, and it\u2019s all about supply constraints today. So if my math is right, does it mean that the WFE and the revenues have to step up in the second half? Is that kind of the implication of $100 billion WFE from where we are today? And is it fair to assume that Lam revenues had to head up \u2013 step up in the back half of this year? And then I have a follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Krish, I do think WFE is back half weighted this year. Maybe as much to do with where true demand is, but also a little bit because I believe the industry in the first half of the year is going to be somewhat supply constrained. So I think it\u2019s going to be a second half weighted spending here, Krish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then Doug, just to like quickly just follow-up on that, is that the implication that your revenue should also step up in the back half?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Likely, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Got it. Alright. Fair enough. And then my follow-up question is just quickly on China, you mentioned about domestic was pretty strong in December. It looks like the domestic China business is going to be strong this year, too. Can you just help us understand what is driving it? There was some recent news about Tsinghua, the parent company of YMTC having some issues. So some investors worry that\u2019s going to cap YMTC\u2019s CapEx or WFE this year? So I am kind of curious, what do you think is going to drive China WFE? Is this still the long tail of smaller trailing edge customers or do you expect the big guys like SMIC and YMTC to also be a big part of domestic China WFE this year? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think that from a China WFE perspective, we think it remains very broad demand across many different players, in fact, even some new fabs and new players that are entering the market there. And while some of it, of course, are big players, a lot of it is our fabs that are addressing what we all know is a very tight trailing-edge technology landscape. And so I think that is a pretty big driver for WFE, and Lam participates well in that market. And Doug mentioned our Reliant business that continues to show record after record in terms of business, and a lot of that stems from investments in places like China at the off leading-edge nodes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the investment performance \u2013 I was just going to say, it\u2019s a very broad set of customers was all I was going to add, Krish. A lot of whom you\u2019ve probably not even heard of, frankly. So there is a long tail of people spending dollars in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Just I mean, Tim and Doug, just want to clarify, you\u2019re not too worried about all the China news on Tsinghua at this point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m not overly concerned. No. There is ample liquidity in China for the aspirations that they have to make the investments they are planning to make.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, guys. I really appreciate the info. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You are welcome, Krish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go next to C.J. Muse of Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C.J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, a derivative to the supply chain issues that you\u2019re seeing and in higher freight costs. Curious your ability to pass along of your higher input cost to customers. I understand there is a long tail in contracts, but would love to get a sense of how you\u2019re seeing that play out here in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. C.J., I\u2019ll take a shot at it. I mean, first of all, I mean, we\u2019re not going to go to the detail on conversations we may be having with customers on that point. But I guess I\u2019d point to a couple of things. One, it\u2019s hard to see perhaps what we are doing, given the overwhelming cost challenges, Doug talked about, relative to the near-term projections. But longer term, Lam equipment is absolutely vital to ramping global semiconductor capacity. That\u2019s important for every one of our customers and industry more broadly. And we\u2019re also \u2013 our equipment is also vital to achieving the technologies road map for the industry. So there is tremendous value in what we do for our customers in the industry, and we always fight to get paid fairly for that value delivered. Right now, I would say that we\u2019re focused squarely on solving these supply chain issues, having conversations with customers and suppliers about how we do that in the most efficient way. And I think as you see us work through that, you\u2019ll see our financial results including gross margin continue to improve into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">C.J. Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Very helpful. And I guess, as my follow-up, as you look at your installed base business, you talked about 24% chamber revenue growth per chamber, which is pretty impressive. Curious how we should think about growth beyond 2021? I think historically, you kind of talked about a 6% to 10% kind of anticipated revenue per chamber CAGR. Has that changed? And should we be thinking a higher number going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, yes, I mean, if you project out these current growth rates, you get to a pretty big customer support business group in the future. But we \u2013 as I mentioned, exceeding expectations, the business is doing extremely well. I would say that we anticipate some mitigation in that growth rate. I think at our Analyst Day, we kind of put out a model to say, look, our objective every year is to go in saying that we will outgrow \u2013 the revenue will outgrow the growth of the installed base, which means fundamentally, you\u2019re moving forward the revenue capture per chamber. Right now, we\u2019ve flowed those numbers away. But some of it may be a little bit short-term. I mean, clearly, everyone is increasing held inventory that probably goes to our spare parts business as well. Over time, and I don\u2019t know when that would be because I think people are going to be a little bit cautious for quite some time about supply issues as we\u2019re talking about. Eventually, they will draw those inventories back to probably more efficient numbers, and that would cause some mitigation in the spare parts business part of CSBG. We\u2019ve also talked about the Reliant business and tremendous growth in upgrades and sales of tools for trailing edge. I don\u2019t know that, that will mitigate so much, but it\u2019s been on a red hot pace the last year or two. And so I would expect some mitigation there. So maybe the best way to think about it is, again, our goal is always to outgrow the growth of the installed base, capturing more revenue per chamber. And so you can model it Lam with expected Taber growth rate plus some \u2013 it\u2019s probably best way to think about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we will move to our next question from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. It\u2019s actually Dana Chen on for Timothy Arcuri. I was wondering if you could touch based on \u2013 you previously talked about like the GM, gross margin headwinds from Malaysia. Can you just help us quantify how should we think about the impact from there in the next few quarters? And is the timing for the new Malaysia manufacturing to shift from like headwind to tailwind maybe in the second half of this year? I just wanted to understand the gross margin impact over there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Malaysia will be a tail in the gross margin. Certainly, as we get into the second half of the year and in my scripted remarks, I basically said, as I look through the rest of calendar year \u201822, I expect gross margin will improve from the levels that we are at today. Part of that will be Malaysia. Part of it will be the mitigation of the supply chain and part of it will be new products coming out and the positive mix factor of that. So, I will give you a few things to think about there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And maybe just touch base on the domestic China WFE, can you just talk about where you think 2021 that came in? And how do you think about that like into 2022 from domestic China?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. The way we have been talking about it is that it was a growth year in \u201821. We didn\u2019t quantify how much, but it was very much in line with the expectations. We described 2020 is roughly $10 billion indigenous Chinese WFE grew last year. It\u2019s going to grow again this year is what I would tell you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alright. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go next to Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on your segment mix with regard to your WFE forecast for the year. Just given where you guys do tend to focus, do you think that, that segment is a potential disadvantage with regard to your ability to grow in line with how you view the WFE market itself growing in 2022?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Stacy, it\u2019s a good question. I do think when I look at growth in \u201822 that you are going to see that the highest level of growth in foundry/logic. That\u2019s just what\u2019s going on. I think that\u2019s pretty well understood. And you are right in your observation, I think, inherent in your question is, historically, we been somewhat less represented there, I guess in terms of share of spend as compared to memory. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Having said that, though we have made a nice step up there in the last couple of years, we continue to \u2013 2021 was a good share position year for us in foundry and logic. So, that\u2019s going to benefit us. And also, when I look at \u201822 WFE, I think you are going to see nice growth in memory, and I will let Tim add on to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Stacy, I guess I just wanted to mention, I mean we have maybe gotten that question a lot of times about how we are doing in foundry and logic and what our plans. I think we have done a nice job of, and it will play out over the next several years. We focused on a lot of our product portfolio and product development on products that put us out in front of that technology roadmap. And just to name a couple of the products. I mean you look at what we have done in atomic layer deposition, selective etch, the low RC materials, dry EUV resist and heterogeneous 3D packaging. All of those are quite tied to ramps in foundry/logic spending. Now the good news is, many of those also play over into our strength in memory like ALD does and selective etch will. But again, we have been very cautious about trying to position the portfolio such that our exposure to foundry/logic ultimately is a positive for the company, and I think we are making progress and we will continue to fulfill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. So, does that suggest you see the share gains that you saw in \u201821 in foundry and logic continuing into \u201822?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think the momentum is going to continue in \u201822, Stacy. Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Helpful. Thank you, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go to our next question from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question like many I am juggling multiple calls. So, I apologize if it\u2019s a little bit repetitive. But just relative to kind of the first question and your ability to meet demand, Doug, and maybe this is a little bit longer term, but you have got a situation where the semi industry took 50 years to get to $0.5 trillion of revenue, and there is many models out there that suggest in the next 8 years, we will get another $500 billion and be $1 trillion in revenue. What do you have to do incremental over a multiyear period to invest to make sure you have \u2013 should the support kind of that kind of demand for supply? And is that already in the backlog for what you guys are doing in Malaysia? And is it already sort of contemplated in some of the OpEx sort of targets you gave us at Analyst Day?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Let me take a shot at it, and Doug can add. But as I kind of went \u2013 and you might not have heard this if you are jumping between calls. But our manufacturing strategy, we have been playing out for the last several years, I think, is really what gives us confidence that we can meet this demand going forward. And that is Malaysia, as you pointed out, but also expansions across our Korea manufacturing facility. This past year, we bought out our joint venture for manufacturing in Taiwan. We expanded all of our U.S. manufacturing sites in a pretty big way. And we also grew our output from our Europe facility. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, I think that when you ask the question, what is it that prepares us for the industry to add another $500 billion in Lam to meet that output, it\u2019s the ability to tap into this global supply chain, which gives us access to larger talent pools, larger supplier bases for many of our parts. Some are very critical, but many of them are sourceable locally to those factories. And I think that\u2019s going to help us increase not only our own capacity, which I think we are making good progress on, but also the capacity of our global supplier base. And that\u2019s something that I would say we are pretty far down that path, but clearly, as evidenced by the current limitations, we still have more room to go, and we will be making progress in the next coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Tim, as my follow-on, giving us visibility 90 days out, given all the logistical issues are hard enough, thinking about the entire year as you did with your WFE comment even harder. But I am kind of curious, clearly, logic/foundry grows faster than memory this year, but we are sort of in this odd position where it kind of looks like from a cyclical perspective, the memory companies tend to be \u2013seem to be spending at a much more constrained level than maybe their logic/foundry partners for the first time ever. If you look at CapEx to rev ratios and growth of CapEx off the bottom, is that how you see it? I guess, importantly, if it is, what implications might that have for memory spending as we go from \u201822 into \u201823?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Well, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 constrained is always more in the eye of the builder for the customer perhaps. But I think you are right that we are seeing a fairly balanced in fact, maybe more balanced spending profile within the memory space, at least is our current view. Maybe back to your original point though about visibility, our visibility at this point is much \u2013 we feel further out in terms of demand side. Our challenge is not understanding demand 6 months, 9 months, 12 months out, maybe even longer. It really is about growing supply capability of our supply base and also our own capacity to meet that growing demand. But I think the implications are that we exit this year still perhaps with robust demand going into 2023. It\u2019s too early to \u2013 we are not going to give a guide at this point for 2023, but I would say is whether it\u2019s in memory or it\u2019s in logic/foundry, a lot of big investments planned, fabs under construction, many of those don\u2019t take the equipment even until starting in \u201823 or maybe even beyond. And so, I think we are going to see robust WFE for the industry for years to come at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks,Tim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go to our next question from Mark Lipacis of Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question and I apologize, I am kind of new on the Lam call, so I apologize if this is elementary. But if we have the semiconductor shortages globally that are causing different vertical markets to lose tens, if not hundreds of billions of dollars in revenues. And you guys make the equipment that actually can solve that problem. Why aren\u2019t Lam and your peers, the absolute number one priority customers for the semiconductors that can make the equipment that solve these challenges? It\u2019s surreal to hear you guys talk about component shortages are preventing you from shipping product that can solve everybody\u2019s problems. That\u2019s the first question. I have a follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. I am not sure it\u2019s such an elementary question, it\u2019s quite a complex one. But I \u2013 boy, I guess, I would say that we try to make that point quite clear. And I think there has been a lot of discussion between companies like ours and the manufacturers just as there are many, many industries talking to those same suppliers about the urgent needs that they have. And so I don\u2019t think we want to make this \u2013 we certainly did not say it\u2019s all about chips, and that\u2019s what\u2019s limiting our supply. It\u2019s one element of some of the component shortages and subsystem shortages, but it has been several other things as well. But I do believe that as we increase both our supplier capacity and our own capacity and output goes up, then that is key to alleviating the problem. And so maybe it becomes a virtuous cycle where more our output goes up, the easier the constraints get and therefore, our outlook goes up even faster. It\u2019s certainly our objective to drive that and we are in close conversation with the semiconductor chip manufacturers who happen to be our customers as well about how they can help. And I would say that in most cases, those customers are stepping in and doing everything they possibly can to help because they want the equipment that we are shipping to them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Mark, I think the only thing I would add is, is typically, we wouldn\u2019t be in the business of buying semiconductors, right. And that\u2019s our suppliers or sometimes even the suppliers of our suppliers that would be procuring those chips. And because we know that group of our customers, their suppliers really, really well, that\u2019s why we are stepping in. Maybe that helps. And we clearly have access to those guys. So, we can make this better quicker, I think is why we are pointing this out right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And a follow-up, if I may. I appreciate that you have \u2013 it sounds like you have very good visibility this year. What is \u2013 what kind of conversations do you have with your customers about 2023, appreciating that they may not be giving you hard orders that far out or maybe they do. But I mean, do you have those kind of planning discussions with your customers about what 2023 might look like? Can you give us any sense of how those conversations go? That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean obviously, we have sufficient conversations for very long lead time decisions that we have to make. So, as I talk about our expansion of manufacturing facilities and hiring rates. One of the components, it\u2019s not a \u2013 that has a relatively long lead time is the hiring of engineers that go on site to support those new customer facilities and projects. And so I would say we are already having discussions with customers about 2023 in earnest. But it\u2019s a little too early to get as precise as many of you probably like in terms of what does the number for 2023 WFE looks like, and we are not going to have that conversation today. But I would say customers are giving a lot of just they want us to be ready. We are having those same conversations with our suppliers because we need them to be ready. And so you can just believe that we are having those conversations quite frequently and quite some temp with customers today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go to our next question from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you. Certainly understand the gross margin pressures based on the costs that you guys are taking on to sort of deal with all these issues. But your customers are kind of dealing with some of the same stuff and are raising prices and passing that on to their customers. If this ends up being a persistent situation where you have high freight costs and component costs and things like that, do you see gross margins kind of getting back to the level they were a couple of quarters ago?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Joe, I do. I specifically \u2013 and you might have been jumping between calls as well. In my prepared remarks, I specifically said I believe gross margin will improve for us as the year progresses. Meaning the March quarter, I believe is a low point for the gross margin in the year. A lot because of these freight logistics and other things in the supply chain that we just need to go fix it, and that\u2019s what we are doing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That makes sense. I mean I guess, just \u2013 you are fixing it because those costs are going away, or are you able to actually charge your customers expedites and things like that to deal with all of it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think our objective is probably to do a little bit of both. As you mentioned, some of the issues may become persistent and built into the cost structure of the history, in which case those ultimately have to be accounted for in the pricing for the industry. And yes, obviously, we are very sensitive to the fact that customers in certain parts of our market are cost sensitive, and therefore, we will try to eliminate as many of the costs first. So, we are not taking the easy way out of just trying to pass the costs on trying to first eliminate them and then those that are persistent will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Joe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go on to our next question from Patrick Ho of Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But maybe for Doug, with the supply chain issues that are going on right now, I know it\u2019s difficult to give a granular answer. But how do you look at the allocations between what\u2019s needed for new shipments and new tools versus your installed base business, which also has a lot of those type of components as well. And obviously, a lot of the customers are at high utilization. What\u2019s the balance there that you are trying to do at least in the near-term to keep your customers as happy as possible on both ends?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I am going to actually give this one to Tim, Patrick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think that\u2019s because what I am going to tell you is that the most valuable tool for the customer is the one that\u2019s in this fab in running. And so \u2013 of course, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 we prioritize today keeping the installed base operating and outputting. And to one of the earlier questions, if we don\u2019t do that, then problem just gets worse because chips aren\u2019t being produced. So, we are having to make that call at certain points, but what I can tell you is that priority is the installed base and keeping tools in manufacturing and output in a way for us and have chips for the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But Patrick, I can either or we are mitigating both at the same time, and it\u2019s not exactly the same supply group that is creating a spare part and new equipment. So, it\u2019s maybe as much an overlap as you might say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not yet. Not every constraint right now exists on a part that would be a spare. Certain subsystems and our tools are not field replaceable spares units. So, there is some overlap but not entirely, as Doug said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Ho</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Patrick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tina Correia</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for one more question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will go to that last question from Atif Malik of Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Tim, you mentioned the gate all around selective edge revenues to double this year. I am curious about the size of this opportunity this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Doug Bettinger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. To be more specific, what I actually said was \u2013 yes. What I actually said was that the selective etch revenue would double. The selective ventures actually used in more applications than just get all around, and I don\u2019t think we are going to quantify the exact size of the business yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then is it possible for you to kind of quantify your exposure of sales to advanced packaging, heterogenic computing just in the ballpark?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We \u2013 I don\u2019t know that we have actually quantified it. But what I would say is that we provide a number of the very critical steps there. Obviously, some of the processes that we have talked about in the past are electroplating. Our etching processes are both critical to some of the high aspect ratio of processes like through-silicon via or other parts of the process to go into 3D packaging. So, it\u2019s a priority market for us, and we have been doing quite well for a number of years in that space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tim Archer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Atif.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I will now turn the call back to Tina Correia for any additional or closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Tina Correia</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining our call today. We appreciate your support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so this concludes today\u2019s call.
