First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, then we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Evan Greenberg</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Chubb had a very good quarter, we produced strong earnings that were driven by world-class underwriting and record investment income. After tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.50 per share compared to two and a quarter per share prior year up 11%. For the six months of this year operating income was up 13% from 2016.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent, 88% compared to 90.2% last year. And it benefited from a substantial improvement in the expense ratio of about 1.5 point as well as lower catastrophe losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total P&amp;C underwriting income of $808 million was up 20%. The current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses for the quarter was outstanding at 87.5%, again almost 1.5 points better than the last year, driven by integration of related expense savings that benefited both the expense ratio and the loss ratio. Those savings plus a loss adjustment expense reserve release mitigated a rise in the underlying current accident year loss ratio of 1.2 points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given the market conditions and the fact that we are in a multi-year soft insurance market, these results are truly distinguishing and clearly demonstrate the benefits of our global capabilities. Our portfolio construction and underwriting management, hallmarks of our Company, they also speak to the quality and talent of my outstanding colleagues around the world, our culture of excellence and craftsmanship at all levels of the organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net investment income for the quarter was a record $855 million, above the guidance we gave you last quarter and up about 5% over prior year. Philip will explain why we exceeded recent guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Chubb\u2019s strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of about 10% for the quarter while for the six months period per share book and tangible book value have grown 4.4% and 7.6% respectively and they have increased about 12.5% and 20% since the merger closing in January of last. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period reserve development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The commercial P&amp;C market is with a few exceptions soft globally, though conditions vary depending on territory, line of business and size of risk. Most areas of the commercial P&amp;C market are soft and highly competitive as many companies reach for growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As noted in the prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered remains very competitive, though pricing maybe beginning to bottom. On the other hand, middle market business with the exception of commercial auto continues to grow more competitive by the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wholesale remains more competitive than retail, particularly in short tail lines. In wholesale certain stressed casualty classes are beginning to get rate, not enough to produce adequate returns, but nonetheless improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Globally new business has been hard to come-by and what simply can be described as a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some degree when it\u2019s about more than rate and we bring the power of the organization to bear for a client or producer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the quarter 11% of North America retail commercials, P&amp;Cs new business and 6% of our international new business came from cross-selling and the power of the organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also our total capabilities in terms of product, service reputation, ability to serve many different types of insurance customers, our deep distribution capability and extensive geography reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional, it will only improve with time. I will point to a few examples later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that as backdrop, the good news is for the business we wrote the trend for pricing improved, rates were essentially flat or the rate of declines slowed in comparison to recent quarters. And in some stress classes we were able to achieve rate, such as U.S. commercial auto, Australian property and [D&amp;O] (Ph), Mexican auto where we are large players and U.S. ENS casualty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In U.S. D&amp;O class that needs rates as we noted on our last call, pricing for the business we wrote went flat. As we projected revenue growth for the quarter continue to trend better on both the publish basis and when adjusted for merger noise. In fact this was our best quarter since the merger in terms of growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, with the exception of our risk management business which had nice growth and continue to benefit from a flight to quality and capability, we wrote less new business trading new business growth for better terms and we lost business for price we weren\u2019t loosing by a few points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our overall renewal retention in the quarter was steady and that was true among the various lines of business with the exception of one that we have discussed before, which is North America property and casualty coverage for real estate related risks. The tough class where Chubb has been leader.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the quarter, P&amp;C net premiums written globally were flat in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had about a 0.5 percentage point impact, adjusted for merger related underwriting actions in reinsurance P&amp;C net premiums were up over 2.5%. As a reminder the impact from these merger related items has and will continue to ameliorate as we move through the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segments. Renewal rates were down about a 0.5% in our U.S. middle market business, with exposure change a positive 1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our U.S. major accounts business, renewals pricing was down about a 0.5% and exposure change with an additional negative 0.5%. In our international retail commercial P&amp;C business pricing was down one, again overall these were the best rate results we have seen in quite a few quarters for the business we wrote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By major class of business beginning with North America, retail general and specialty casualty related pricing was down about a 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about a 0.5% with D&amp;O flat and property related pricing was down one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Internationally, general and specialty casualty related pricing was down 2%. Financial lines pricing was flat and property related pricing was down 3%. The UK commercial P&amp;C market remains highly competitive, but overall we achieved better pricing with rates mostly flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The continent of Europe on the other hand became marginally more competitive. In Australia we achieved meaningful rate in property and DNO a rationale sign for what is a very competitive market. The balance of Asia and most of Latin America largely remain status quo in terms of pricing trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now with that as context, let me give you some more detail on revenue results for the quarter. In our North America commercial P&amp;C business, net premiums were down 1.3%. Normalizing for merger related underwriting, net premiums were up about 1.5% and the renewal retention ratio for retail was at 88%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall new business writings for North America commercial lines were up about 3.5% over second quarter 2016. Again with the exception of risk management, we wrote less new business than prior year. The trade we are not happy to make, but we will take all day long to secure adequate underwriting terms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 2%. Excluding the six point impact of additional reinsurance growth was 8%. Rates were up 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remains very strong at about 95%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our overseas, general insurance operations, net premiums written for international retail P&amp;C business were up about one and a quarter in the quarter in constant dollars and over 3% excluding underwriting action. As a few highlights, Asia-Pac, Asia-Pacific commercial P&amp;C business was up 9% on the back of Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Japan P&amp;C was up 12%, Latin America [A&amp;E] (Ph) was up 11.5% and international personal lines were up over 9%. Mexico continues to be a bright spot for us, up strong double-digits overall for the quarter. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are in good shape with the remainder of our integration activity, operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on-track or ahead of schedule. As you saw in the press release, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of 2018 to $875 million, up from $800 million, which is up from the original $650 million when we announce the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These savings are directly contributing to our margins in the phase of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends while giving us room to invest in our competitive profile, including our technology, our talent, new lines of business and future operating efficiency. We are investing substantial sums, talent and time in positioning this Company to be a leader in a digital age, because the economy globally is digitizing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This includes our organization structure, cycle times of change, expertise and skill sets of our people, data and analytics, robotics, the front-end customer experience to the customer back-end claims experience and the very definition of the products we sell. This is not just strategy, we are quietly executing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, we are operating in a highly competitive P&amp;C market and navigating it well. There is no other Company better diversified and positioned with the breadth of capabilities, culture, talent, broad distribution and presence around the world that we have today at Chubb.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have built and are building a revenue machine. Governed however by our underwriting discipline and it gives us great confidence and optionality in uncertain times and makes us more relevant to our customers and business partners. The entire organization is intently focused on execution, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to outperform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will turn the call over to Phil and then we will back to take your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Philip Bancroft</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Evan. Chubb\u2019s overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we continue to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business around the globe with total capital exceeding $63 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We grew our tangible book value per share by 4.3% in the quarter. Concerning tangible book value per share growth, you will remember that at the close of our merger the initial dilution to our tangible book value per share was 29%, since then we have reduced that dilution to about 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $667 million to shareholders including $332 million in dividends and $335 million in shares repurchased. Year-to-date though June 30, our share repurchases have totaled 475 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Investment income of $855 million was a record and was $20 million higher than our expectations. Half of that increase was due to higher than estimated private equity distributions and the other half from increased call activity in our corporate bond portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net realized and unrealized gain for the quarter was $747 million pre-tax and include a $588 million gain from the investment portfolio primarily from decreases in interest rates and gains from our private equity portfolio. We have also had $116 million gain from FX and an $80 million gain in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net loss reserves increased $226 million for the quarter. The pace of incurred ratio in the quarter was 99%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 95%. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $170 million pre-tax, about a $144 million after-tax.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This include a $43 million pre-tax of adverse development related to our run-off non-A&amp;E casualty exposures, which is included in corporate, and $57 million pre-tax favorable development relating to our industrial accident workers\u2019 compensation coverage from the 2016 accident year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The remaining favorable development was split 40% long tail lines principally for the 2012 and prior accident years and 60% short tail lines. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were 200 million or a $152 million after-tax compared to $390 million or $311 million after-tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily from U.S. weather related events.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Integration realized and annualized run rate savings are ahead of expectation. Total incremental integration related savings realized in the quarter were a $105 million leading to total inception to-date realized savings of $554 million. On an annualized run rate basis, savings through June are $775 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Evan noted, we now expect to achieve annualized run rate savings of $875 million by the end of 2018 up from our prior estimate of $800 million. We are also expecting integration and merger related expenses to be $903 million up from our prior estimate of $809 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we disclosed in our press release the benefit of these integration related savings is reflected in our combined ratio. Our combined ratio in the quarter reflected the incremental impact of integration related savings of $104 million, a $45 million benefit related to the harmonization of the Company\u2019s pension and retiree healthcare plans and the release of loss adjustment expense reserves of $30 million. These favorable items was partially offset by increased spending to support growth and the impact of salary increases and inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We noted in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we expect the incremental annualized impact of our U.S. retirement plan harmonization to be approximately $100 million pre-tax. Through six months we have realized $80 million, the remaining $20 million is expected to be recognized in the second half of 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The operating income tax rate for the quarter is 16%, which is at the low end of our expected range, principally due to a higher level of catastrophe losses occurring in the U.S. we expect our annual effective tax rate to remain within 16% to 18% range for the remainder of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will turn the call back over to Helen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Helen Wilson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions]. We will go first question to Ryan Tunis, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey thanks. I guess my first question was just thinking about these merger related underwriting actions in reinsurance. I guess at this point, it\u2019s a pretty substantial number and I guess the way we see it, so far it feels like it\u2019s only shown up in the form of lower net written premium, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the right interpretation or there is other price if that we are seeing it, whether it\u2019s like the was the cat load lower this quarter than it would have been as you not done that. Is there a meaningful free up in capital or is it actually serving as a pretty major tailwind on like the expense ratio and a loss ratio just any help on that would be useful? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well first of all you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it in the cat load, because we don\u2019t give guidance. So you don\u2019t actually know what our cat load is, but as an example we have told you this before, first of all you get the annualized impact of reinsurance it has to run its course. So we bought a quota share treaty last year, Northeast quota share it\u2019s also in our Qs and Ks. And we bought that and we were very clear - I\u2019m giving you one example, in third quarter last year that the trade-off of premium versus buying straight cat access on a risk reward basis made much more sense to us and that did lower our cat profile as one example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Secondly, merger related underwriting actions both for concentration exposure on a per risk or a cat basis as well as portfolio that haven\u2019t met our underwriting standards of making a reasonable underwriting return. When you look at the accident year loss ratio it is benefiting and that it is in fact flat year-on-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s illogical when you think about rate and trend. Mathematically, it\u2019s not possible, if you are mathematically on us. However, what ameliorates that what ameliorates it is expense savings and also underwriting actions that we have taken merger related that help to ameliorates that. I hope that answers your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess my follow-up is just on some of your commentary about the competitive environment. I think you said shared and layered remains competitive though pricing is beginning to bottom. On the other hand middle market is becoming more competitive. I guess at this point in the cycle, what do you think is driving that the economy and what do you think it\u2019s going to take for the middle market in particular I guess to reach the bottom and the new business to become more attractive? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, large account and shared and layered has been competitive for longer. I mean, they have been both rate and trends that\u2019s be gridding on for a few years between the wholesale market feeding it and the direct retail market and reinsurers. All participants have been involved in the competitive environment there and it has been going on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At some point, what happens? Losses start coming in, broader terms and conditions, they start catching up to pricing and combined ratios rise, you see it. It\u2019s not hiding itself. And that eventually causes rates to begin to flatten out. Not necessarily in a place to that [equip] (Ph), but the first thing I have to do start flattening out. So market wares itself out at some point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the middle market, the middle market is always more orderly than the large account particularly shared and layered. And that began late, that has just only began in the last number of quarters to become more competitive where companies are trying to reach for growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Economic growth is reasonably slow and companies are reaching for more growth, because they don\u2019t have another way to go and as you are seeing EPS and that will go for a little while. It is my sense. I don\u2019t see a catalyst excepted really combined ratios underwriting cash flow. So Ryan, I can\u2019t forecast the future, I sit with a crystal ball, but my sense is, it\u2019s more competitive and it will remain that way for a little while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ryan Tunis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. My first question is on the premium growth. I appreciate all the color in terms of merger and the reinsurance. Evan you mentioned obviously the increase reinsurance to place last year starting in the third quarter. So when we kind of tie together your commentary about the market and how you see the business. Are we reaching the point when the third quarter of this year on an ex-currency basis, we should start to see your growth in that premium written?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know we don\u2019t give forward guidance, but I don\u2019t see a reason why the trend that we are seeing in our underlying growth doesn\u2019t continue and merger-related underwriting actions will continue to ameliorate as the year goes along. And you are correct there was a large - last year not only did we buy it, we also did an [un-urged] (Ph) premium transfer that also impacted net written premium at that time. So you are correct it was more penalty last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. And then in terms of revenue synergies, first off if you could just get a number for the quarter? And then second, Evan I know in the past you had kind of tied your long-term view just to kind of give a ballpark figure to at least being equal to level of expenses for the deal in terms of revenue synergies. The expense saves has been increased, does your view on revenue synergies also increased, and if you can just talk high level about the revenue synergies that have come about to-date compared to your expectations?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and remember what I spoke to was a - I don\u2019t have my exact words in front of me, but that we have revenue, we would have expense saves that translated to operating income and that we would have income from additional revenue opportunities that would approach some proportional either equal or within a range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I haven\u2019t changed my view on the revenue side, we haven\u2019t really top stated that frankly to look forward in the next two or three years about that. All things being equal, the revenue synergies that we have projected remain on-track. We are growing the small commercial business, we said that would take years to occur. That is happening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We said that we would gain in middle market around the globe and small commercial around the globe. That is on-track. We have been planting the seeds for that and placing and building operations in targeted markets around the world that will feed that growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We said cross-selling and that by really important cross-selling the strength in the organization, bringing more products to the distribution in North Americas fast middle market capabilities that we haven\u2019t shut and that is happening. We are driving that and we can measure that, whether it is cyber insurance, environment liabilities, specialty casualty, international coverages for middle market companies, we are seeing that. We can measure that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on the other side of coin, the governor in a little it for us is underwriting, because it\u2019s a soft market with a lot of headwind and that\u2019s what governs it the other way. Sometimes you get more joy through the effort, sometimes you get less, we stay steady.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the number of\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we told you that 11% to the new business and 6% of new business and I think Phil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have for the quarter a 110 million of gross written premiums that relates to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elyse Greenspan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, perfect. And one last question. Can just give a little bit of color on what will be adverse development within your North America personal line segment in the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019m going to give that to Paul Krump, who was waiting for you to ask that question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Krump</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning Elyse thank you Evan. Let me unpack this a little bit for you Elyse. The second quarter PPD amounts reflects unfavorable vast development from a combination of prior period tax, wreck marine and auto liability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me just dispose the wreck margin quickly, because that was one single claim. When you think about of cats, that was about a third of the amount and the third was coming from auto liability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recall Elyse that we brought together legacy ace, firemen\u2019s fund in Chubb and in doing so we have integrated the reserving processes for all three companies and we have also then brought together a far more credible data than we previously had available for automobile. And that data has caused us to increase our expectations slightly on some portions of the book.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now recall, though that this is over several actions years and just that about a third of the amount of PPD is the raise in the auto. So it\u2019s very much a de-minimums amount and I think it\u2019s important to note that that data pegs our thinking about pricing and our underwriting moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kai Pan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you and good morning. First question on the cost savings target and where is the - Phil can you could talk more about where the $75 million additional cost savings come from and how much you plan to reinvestment in that business, how much do you think can flow through that bottom line?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes well, you are already seeing it flow through the bottom line substantially and we are investing in the business as I gave you on the commentary. Where it comes from is spread broadly across the organization, its fundamentally not in the underwriting units or in sales and marketing, its more in support operations and it is personal cost related, it is outside services related, it is IT related and it\u2019s to some degree real estate related.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kai Pan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Then my second question and follow-up on the reserve side. I also had a personal eye in the North American commercial business also see a year-over-year slowing down in terms of reserve releases. Just wondering if you can provide additional sort of color on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it was a positive reserve release, which speaks to strength of our reserves. Our prior period reserve development has variability, it varies by quarter. It depends on the reserve studies that we do in the quarter and which we do, we study all major lines through the year and quarter-to-quarter though this variability depends on what you did study.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again our reserves are strong, the first quarter I will remind you was essentially flat with prior year, I think it was down $10 million or $15 million bucks. I can\u2019t predict the future, I don\u2019t know future trends, frequency and severity versus the inputs we use to create our reserves in any given line of business. But again, what I\u2019m very comfortable with this, our reserves are quite strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kai Pan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for that. And if I may just one, quick one. You see unfavorable releasing unallocated claims, handling expense contribute to the loss ratio improvements the one point. Is that one-off?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, it can be. Yes, we studied it every year and/or more than once a year, we look at what we put away for future claim development. And so like any other reserve, we study that and this quarter, the actual projected and what we have seen as trend versus what we are holding reserve, resulted in the release. I can tell you, last year when we did second quarter review, we also had a reserve release then on unallocated loss adjustments expense. But I can\u2019t predict the future of that, it\u2019s not like well, it\u2019s just as, you are going to harvest a reserve release in UA area, you don\u2019t know that, you can\u2019t project it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kai Pan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jay Gelb, Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. I was hoping, you could comment on the recent favorable trends that\u2019s been identified in the slowdown, in the number of law suits being filed in state courts and whether that would have a positive trend on Chubb\u2019s loss cost inflation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have seen the same thing that is slowed, we read the same headlines you read and we see that out there. We haven\u2019t noticed it, particularly in our casualty loss costs development. Though, I can say that in general casualty in particular reserve releases have come from trends lower than we projected, so that is a fact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the other hand, when you look at litigation related to directors and officers, there is no improvement in that area, and in fact frequency and severity have worsened. The article that you read refer to general litigation of nuisance suits and others in that where Americans would freely reach for a legal remedy to any misfortune that came to them, that there is a decline in that. That you don\u2019t see in directors and officers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I appreciate that. And then more broadly given all the back and forth we are seeing from the administration, on various topics. I thought, you could help us out by updating us on your views around tax and trade?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You want to get me in trouble. Don\u2019t you? My views remain as they were. For our country and for our economy to reach its full potential which it is not right now. We need tax reform, we need infrastructure, the state of infrastructure in our country is shameful, and is a competitive disadvantage and we are somehow lackadaisical about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can tell you, I travel around the world, you go to China, you go to other countries that are growing near economies and will grow their economies more rapidly than us, their infrastructure is far superior and that is a tax on us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regulation, deregulating is so important. An awful lot of this requires legislation and we need an administration that is focused, that is working with Congress and we need a Congress that comes together to address these issues of our country. There is just no doubt about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When it comes to trade, I stand firm, our country has benefited substantially, in particular NAFTA and it is a competitive advantage to our country. And that agreement is up for negotiations right now to modernize it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019m hopeful and I believe there are so many in the administration who understand it that it is important for us to modernize it and to recognize the benefit to our citizens that all three countries gain parties to NAFTA from NAFTA. It makes a competitive North America in a global marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Gelb</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will next to Sarah DeWitt, JP Morgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sarah DeWitt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the agriculture business. How you are looking in that business, it seems like through conditions are worsening. So any color you could give on what is going on there would be helpful?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to turn it over to solve it to farmer John Lupica.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Lupica</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But you are obsessing in that about the western part of the Corn Belt and not the eastern part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">John Lupica</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Sarah thanks. It\u2019s John. So yes our early focus this year was on winter wheat and the growing conditions for the spring crop that you mentioned. Right now the winter wheat appears to be in line with our expectation, which is good news. And then the planting acreage may have dropped a little bit, but we expect that to show itself when we see the final revenue come out from the spring crops.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as for the spring crops, as you know we are in the midst of the growing season now. So we don\u2019t have final, final look at it. The weather was a bit wet early in the season, but late in the summer we have seen the Western Corn Belt get hot and dry. So we are watching that. We can certainly use some rain outlast. The Eastern Corn Belt is doing terrific, and that looks to be in better shape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So right now we are watching the pattern. There is nothing out there that leads us to believe that we wouldn\u2019t have anything about an average year. And I will just remind you, last year was just one of the best we had ever seen in this business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sarah DeWitt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you. That\u2019s helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will go next to Ian Gutterman with Balyasny.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks. If I could start Phil with just a follow-up on [indiscernible], first that 30 million shot in PPD or is it just from the regular loss ratio and then secondly was it concentrated in any one line which is spread across all the different segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all we consider that current accident years, not in PPD. Paul would you say there was any concentration?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Paul Krump</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That segment North American commercial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes North America commercial, but [indiscernible].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay make sense. I guess as on personal lines growth the 8% sort of adjusted is a pretty strong results, obviously it sounds like a decent part of that is rate and exposure, but it seems like there are some maybe accelerating unit growth as well. Can you just talk about what is driving that, its obliviously a tough time at least on the auto side. I know it\u2019s a smaller part of the book, but for peers are you finding opportunities to take business from people or is it mostly the home driving I was just curious?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First , I would say this to you. our auto book is not a huge book, we are not a general auto market rider and we are earning in underwriting profit in automobile. We had unit growth in the quarter, we wrote double-digit number of new policies. Some of that is multiple policies on a customer and so we would say high-single thousands or mid-single thousands of new policy count.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are trying to get a handle better data on buying policies backed in customers in aggregate and making sure we have that exactly right, so I don\u2019t wanted to misspeak about that. But we are gaining grip and our growth is coming in all three areas, we are getting it from the mass affluent, we are getting it from the higher segments of high net worth, all the way up to very high net worth both number of customers, but as well their own exposures grow as they acquire more assets, homes, et cetera and we are up selling there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m pleased with the progress we are making in personal lines, I can tell you as you get it, it\u2019s like talking about small commercial, it comes in small bites, it take a long time to effect change that really shows in numbers in a significant way, but I like the way our marketing in sales is organized in our field operations, I like how we are being able to now begin to target county-by-county of the United States, where our target market is and beginning to put in place the capabilities in the sales and agent process to be able to target those customers to go after.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s not a six months project, that\u2019s multi-year project to really shows itself, but we are doing that. I like what is going on in our branding, I like what is going on in our new product capabilities as we rollout coverages and farm and ranch and cyber and directors and officers liability, not for profit in a better way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I like what we were doing in our service in underwriting, to the very high net worth and being able to underwrite them between admitted in E&amp;S and global in a better way and we can do even better. The game plan we have put in place, if anything we are just crystallizing or focus on it, we are operationalizing better, we have more talent that we brought into high net worth from both inside and outside the organization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have restructured, so that we can get a better focus on individual markets and as well speed of how we may change, but at the same time, this is a filed product state-by-state, rating product changes and system changes take time. I love the future ahead of us in that line of business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, thanks. If I can ask a quick one on commercial, just you sounded a little bit, I don\u2019t know if optimism is the right word, but certainly less pessimistic on where rates are. Is it fair to say though that even if this is a sign of a bottom, we are still trailing loss trend. I\u2019m not trying to ask you for guidance. As I\u2019m looking ahead beyond this year, there is still probably pressure on margins before any improvements that you make from mix or other changes?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely Ian. Look, I would say this. What we saw in pricing? I don\u2019t if one robin and makes a spring. So I can\u2019t tell, number one. Number two, but look, I recognize it for what it is and its better than we have seen on our book in a number of quarters, number one. Number two, it was on our book of business. And the business were not writing new or that we are losing. I said it in the commentary, I\u2019m going to underline, we are not losing for a couple of points. So it is a hungry market out there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When we look at terms and conditions, we lose for terms and conditions that we find, it will go across the board that make us shake our heads that are just final irresponsible or dumb. And so we see the market continuing. On the other hand, we do even see in the market generally pricing in a number of classes bottoming. But it\u2019s at a level that absolutely will not earn and underwriting profit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ian Gutterman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Completely understood. Thank you for the comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will go next to Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. With exposure assuming to be improving broadly. How do you think we should think about the portion of exposure increases in your book of business that acts like rates versus that which is actual exposure or increases? I\u2019m just trying to think about the impact\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I know what you think. But Paul, I\u2019m curious, where do you see exposure improving?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, maybe it\u2019s my hope that the economy improve in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. but be careful, don\u2019t witch cast here, because I\u2019m not sure you are seeing it. I don\u2019t see exposure growth improving. I see it flat and in some cases down actually than what we saw say a year ago. I think the economy is solid, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exciting, just kind of taking a long.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The way to think about that is, there is an element and it varies by line of business. Exposure growth for instance in personal lines, a portion of the exposure growth just subsidize rate and a portion of the exposure growth is truly just a one-for-one trade-off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In commercial lines, it\u2019s a mix also. To be able to tease that out to you and give you a rule of thumb or point estimate, I can\u2019t do it, but you are correct about the elements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fair enough. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I realize it\u2019s not a satisfactory mathematical answer to you, but you are not on to the wrong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can only ask.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of course you can. And I can only try to answer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Newsome</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. That was it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will go next to Brian Meredith with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks. Two quick questions here. First one, I\u2019m just curious, was there any favorable or unfavorable impact from currency on operating earnings this quarter? And what do you think it\u2019s going to look like here going forward given some of the weakness of the dollar?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was minimal, it was about $4 million on operating earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And if we look at where we are today, is it benefit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t think there could be any substantial benefit. Let\u2019s see what happens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know it depends, tell us the currency, give us the basket and we will have a better idea, but it\u2019s bouncing around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got you. And then second question, I\u2019m just curious we are hearing more and more talk about distribution changes going on in the U.S. around the small commercial side and people planning for it. When you look at the small commercial business and your entry into it, are you planning on or your thoughts on direct distribution capability?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Change is coming. I listen to a lot of loud talk these days, that I tried to say in my commentary, we are doing an awful lot, but we are going about it quite right. I think this helps better speak than a lot loud chatter. And I do think some of the talk is ahead of the reality at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But with that said, change is coming. And we are not alone as in terms of carriers improving their capabilities, because of what technology brings that will lead that change. It\u2019s around data, it\u2019s around straight through process, it\u2019s around data that improves the customer experience, while at the same time improving your ability to select risk and to do it quickly i.e. in seconds and to be able to then straight through process business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s claims on the other end, almost certain co-boarded claims that can be settled the same way. These capabilities will improve the intermediary ability to sell and service the business at a lower cost, to take that cost out it will speed the process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But at the same time those same capabilities will be delivered through new clients at the intermediary, dot-com type intermediaries, where potential customers are buying other services and products and its natural that it at that time they consider insurance, you are licensing your business your small business, you are setting up the accounting and financing of your small business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a time that you will consider insurance as an example, there will be many like that. You taking out a loan for your business and technology enables those other forms of distribution. The customer will buy it from a desktop, the customer will buy it from a mobile device, they will buy it any time anywhere and they will service it anytime anywhere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is not futuristic in the sense of measuring it in years from now. It\u2019s on our door step, this is the next two years or shorter, it will be iterative, it will only get better and better and better. There won\u2019t be one winner, there will be a number of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so you see aggregate is continuing to kind of gain share here at least have success in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Define aggregator to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean something like a continuous dot-com in the UK and the personal line side perhaps something here in the U.S. just seems like it hasn\u2019t really caught traction here in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well you know maybe I can see single source distribution with other financial services, I can see those who offer multiple choice, for those who simply want to shop insurance. I\u2019m agnostic, I don\u2019t see any one of them as winners, I see multiple winners, because I don\u2019t think there is one kind of consumer out there, one kind of buying behavior out there and I think there are going to be other compelling options who are you to use in terms of buying that you haven\u2019t had as a choice now to-date. That\u2019s what I say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Meredith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Cohen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I just want to get an update on the life insurance business, it looks like both the earnings contribution and revenue growth is slowing there, and I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about what is happening?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the VA business are run-off, variable annuity business. We told you earlier I think it was in the fourth quarter that we adjusted our models and took our earnings and as a result put up our reserve that took down our earnings year-on-year. So quarter-on-quarter was around about $15 million to $16 million a quarter just coming off because of that change, right. And then our international life business is actually growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know Jay what I would do is if you look at Page 18 of this supplement, you will see that while the GAAP premium is down 3% , 3.5% the overall production in the quarter is up 8% if you include deposits and it\u2019s up 14% over the six months. So we are starting to see strong growth in the production for the overall international life book.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We would look at production more than GAAP premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Cohen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is a kind of FAS product that\u2019s being sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our last question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Evan, can you compare the list of business within reinsurance now to two or three years ago. Is that changing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Say that again Meyer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m wondering whether, obviously the premium volumes in global reinsurance are coming down. So it\u2019s the mix opposite?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well. I\u2019m just trying to add it up before I give you a complete answer, because everything has been coming down. Casualty is down, risk property is down, cat has been down. The mix is probably pretty steady, maybe it\u2019s biases a little more towards the risk lines than the cat lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then finally, can you just get a quick explanation of what will be adverse development in the corporate segment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s the run-off business, the Brandywine run-off business is in the corporate segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Philip Bancroft</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So it was the business that was put into Brandywine in about 1995, there is a number of casualty lines where we had development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We don\u2019t have a run-off division, that we sort of put things we don\u2019t like. This is the Brandywine run-off. And also Chubb had as well run-off A&amp;E. And we study the loan, what we call LTE other than, it\u2019s other than asbestoses environmental which are third and fourth quarter. This is the other lines that would be like sexual molestation, et cetera, and it\u2019s a run-off of that and that\u2019s where charge was taken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Meyer Shields</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Evan Greenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You are welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Helen Wilson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking you to you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day.</p>", "twitContent": "$CB - Chubb's (CB) CEO Evan Greenberg on Q2 2017 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4090742-chubbs-cb-ceo-evan-greenberg-on-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "4205", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17862", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "18100", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17878", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4090742-chubbs-cb-ceo-evan-greenberg-on-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4090742-chubbs-cb-ceo-evan-greenberg-on-q2-2017-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
