We\u2019ll also have demo stations with several new products and technologies, we\u2019ll be introducing at the event. There won\u2019t be a webcast, so we hope you\u2019ll join us in San Jose.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And with<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> that introduction, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gary Dickerson.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gary Dickerson</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Mike. Applied Materials made a strong start to fiscal 2024 with first quarter revenue in the high end of our guidance and earnings that exceeded our guided range. Our inflection-focused innovation strategy is delivering results. We have outperformed our markets for five consecutive years and believe we are in a great position as customers transition major new chip innovations to high-volume production over the next several years. The breadth of our technology capabilities, combined with our deep customer relationships, allows us to see inflections early and accelerate key technology innovations that are critical to scaling AI, IoT, electric vehicles and renewable energy. We have reshaped and expanded our portfolio of solutions that enable next-generation transistors, new interconnect schemes, including backside power delivery, high-performance DRAM including high bandwidth memory, and specialty applications in the ICAPS market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In my prepared remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some examples of how these inflections grow Applied\u2019s available market and are highly accretive to our share. I\u2019ll also talk about our long-term strategy to accelerate innovation and commercialization velocity through tighter collaboration with our customers and partners. But to begin, let me share our latest perspective on the market environment. In our discussions with customers, we\u2019re hearing that overall market dynamics are improving. There is a reacceleration of capital investment by cloud companies, fab utilization is increasing across all device types and memory inventory levels are normalizing. In terms of Applied\u2019s business in 2024, we see leading-edge foundry-logic being stronger year-over-year, even though some important projects are delayed. We\u2019re forecasting ICAPS demand to be slightly lower than 2023 with weakness in some end markets being offset by strong regional investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect our NAND revenues to be up year-on-year, but NAND to remain less than 10% of total wafer fab equipment spending. And we see continued strength in our DRAM business, driven by customers ramping production of high-bandwidth memory. High-bandwidth memory where high-performance DRAM dies are stacked and connected to logic die with advanced packaging is a key enabler for the AI data center. The dies used in high-bandwidth memory are more than two times larger than standard DRAM, which means that more than twice the capacity is needed to produce the same volume of chips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On top of this, the packaging steps needed for die stacking further increase our total available market. High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, made up only about 5% of DRAM output in 2023, but is expected to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate over the coming years. DRAM is a great example of how our inflection-focused innovation approach is working, by focusing on the critically enabling process and packaging steps for next-generation technologies, Applied has significantly increased our share of the DRAM market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In 2023, we estimate that our DRAM share was more than 10 points higher than it was a decade earlier. And our DRAM revenues were larger than our two closest process equipment peers combined. We\u2019re also best positioned for future growth, thanks to our leadership in logic technologies that have been implemented for DRAM peripheral circuitry applications to enable significantly increased IO speeds. Our strong position in DRAM patterning, our unique co-optimized hard mask solutions, which are critical for capacitor scaling and advanced packaging, where we have strong leadership positions in Micro-bump and Through-Silicon Vias that will enable multiple generations of high-bandwidth memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fiscal 2024, we expect our HBM packaging revenues to be four times larger than last year, growing to almost $0.5 billion. And across all device types, we expect revenue from our advanced packaging product portfolio to grow to approximately $1.5 billion. Looking further ahead, we see opportunities for this business to double again, as heterogeneous integration is more widely adopted, and we introduced new products that expand our served market. Another key inflection that will transition to high-volume production beginning this year is gate-all-around transistors in leading-edge foundry-logic. These complex 3D structures can provide a more than 30% improvement in a chip\u2019s energy efficiency. This is especially enabling for high-performance AI data center applications. The shift from FinFET to gate-all-around grows Applied\u2019s available market by $1 billion for every 100,000 wafer starts per month of capacity. And we\u2019re on track to gain share and capture over 50% of the spending for the process equipment used in this new transistor module.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Major advances in leading-edge foundry-logic and DRAM are also driving the need for more and better metrology and inspection to be integrated into the manufacturing flow. We have developed industry-leading cold field emission eBeam technology that enables highly sensitive 2D and 3D imaging at up to ten times higher speeds. We expect our CFE systems revenue to grow by a factor of 4 in 2024 and represent 50% of our total eBeam system sales. The incredible innovation we see in the industry today is not limited to the leading edge. In recent years, ICAPS customers have invested about 10% of their revenues or about $30 billion annually in research and development to accelerate the roadmap for IoT, communications, automotive, power and sensor technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ICAPS technology depends less on shrinking device features and customer investments are heavily weighted towards new structures, new materials and new integration approaches, playing to the core strengths of Applied. ICAPS is another area where we saw market inflections early. And five years ago, we formed a dedicated team to focus on the needs of these customers. Since then, we\u2019ve released more than 20 new ICAPS products that target the highest value device innovations in these markets and we have a robust development pipeline of unit process and integrated solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While major end market inflections, such as AI and IoT, electric vehicles and renewable energy are already driving semiconductor growth and innovation, it\u2019s important to recognize they are still in the early stages of adoption. For example, high-performance GPUs for AI data centers only represent 6% of leading-edge foundry-logic wafer starts today. The full potential of technologies like AI cannot be unlocked without next-generation chips with better performance, power and cost. The technology roadmap for semiconductors is rich with possibilities and opportunities, but also incredibly complex. No company is better placed to address this complexity than Applied Materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With the industry\u2019s broadest and deepest portfolio of capabilities and products, we have a unique ability to combine, co-optimize and integrate our technologies to develop highly differentiated solutions for our customers. To bring these advances to market faster, we\u2019re also innovating the way we innovate, by driving earlier and deeper collaboration with our customers and partners. We are expanding our global innovation network that will connect into the EPIC center we\u2019re building in Silicon Valley. During the quarter, we announced an expansion of our long-term partnership with Leti, which is focused on accelerating ICAPS innovation, and we launched a new collaboration with MIT, which is centered around next-generation power electronics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As industry complexity rises, we\u2019re also delivering more value to customers with our advanced services that enable our customers to accelerate R&amp;D, transfer new technology into volume manufacturing faster and then optimize yield, output and cost in their factories. AGS has delivered 18 consecutive quarters of year-on-year growth. Revenue for the first quarter was up 8% versus the same period last year, and the business is now at a $6 billion annual run rate. AGS has the opportunity for double-digit growth this year, and we believe we can sustain this growth rate into the future. A significant portion of AGS revenue is generated from subscriptions. We have almost 17,000 tools under service agreements, up 8% year-on-year, and these agreements have a very high renewal rate over 90%. Before I pass the call over to Brice, I will quickly summarize. Applied Materials outperformed our markets in 2023 for the fifth consecutive year and we delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The positions we\u2019ve established at key industry inflections, will support continued outperformance, as customers ramp next-generation chip technologies into high-volume production. We are strengthening R&amp;D collaboration with customers and partners to drive innovation and commercialization velocity, improvements in mutual success rate and R&amp;D investment efficiencies. And we see growing demand for our advanced services that are helping customers manage increasing complexity in their business as the industry scales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll hand over to Brice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Gary. And I\u2019d like to thank our teams for delivering strong revenue and margins this quarter and making further improvements in our operating performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll discuss our value creation strategy and the results it is producing, then I\u2019ll summarize our growth thesis and why we believe we will outperform our markets in the years ahead, finally, I\u2019ll summarize our Q1 results and provide our guidance for Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll begin by discussing how our assets and strategy create value for shareholders. Applied has the broadest and deepest process equipment portfolio and expertise in the industry. We are highly invested in collaborating with our customers, allocating $3 billion in annual R&amp;D to invent new solutions to the most critical Semiconductor manufacturing challenges. Increasingly, the only way to solve these challenges is by co-optimizing and integrating our chamber technologies in new ways. In addition, identifying new materials and processes early and collaborating closely with customers, leads to faster results, a higher probability of success, greater efficiency and stronger financial returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The benefits of our value creation strategy are being demonstrated in our financial results. We generated record equipment sales, $20.7 billion in calendar 2023, including legacy equipment reported in AGS. And we extended our strong position in DRAM with record calendar year sales of over $4.3 billion. In fact, over the past ten years, the company has gained over 10 points of DRAM share in multiple points of overall share. This has contributed to Applied delivering a fifth straight year of overall WFE share gains and one of the best share outcomes of the past 20 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the same ten fiscal years, we\u2019ve grown company revenue at a compound rate of over 13%, non-GAAP EPS at nearly 30%, free cash flow at 33% and dividends per share at nearly 12%. Also, over this period, we increased return on invested capital from 8% to 35% and reduced net shares outstanding by over 30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, I will summarize our growth thesis. As we look out over the planning horizon, we expect semiconductors to grow significantly faster than GDP. Second, we expect the equipment market to grow as fast or faster than semiconductors over time, driven by increasing technical complexity. Third, we expect Applied\u2019s equipment business to outgrow the market. And fourth, we expect our services business to grow as fast or faster than our equipment business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll take a moment to support the third pillar of our thesis that Applied\u2019s equipment business will outgrow the market. The reason is that our technologies enable the key semiconductor advances needed to drive growth in AI, IoT and renewable energy. Looking ahead to the semiconductor process inflections that will play out over the next several years, the company is extremely well positioned. In data center AI, we are number one in process equipment for advanced logic and compute memory, both standard DRAM and high-bandwidth memory. We also have line of sight to share a 50% or more in gate-all-around transistors, backside power delivery and advanced packaging. We are equally strong in edge AI and IoT with the number one position in ICAPS silicon, which is used to sense and convert analog information and transmit it to the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are also innovating rapidly in ICAPS technology for the global energy transformation, including through new agreements with partners like Leti and MIT, which Gary described.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, we feel confident that our unique assets and collaboration strategy position Applied to continue to outpace our markets and deliver strong shareholder returns as these major inflections play out over the next several years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll summarize our Q1 results. On a year-over-year basis, net sales declined slightly to $6.7 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin grew 110 basis points to 47.9%, non-GAAP OpEx grew 5.6% to $1.23 billion, and non-GAAP EPS grew nearly 5% to $2.13.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our segment results, Semiconductor Systems revenue was strong at $4.91 billion and included record DRAM and edge system sales. Segment non-GAAP operating margin was 35.7%. While our operating expenses are primarily focused on R&amp;D programs for emerging technology inflections, we are also investing to expand and diversify our manufacturing logistics and supply chain to efficiently serve future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Applied Global Services delivered record revenue and its 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. AGS revenue increased approximately 8% year-over-year to nearly $1.8 billion and segment non-GAAP operating margin was 28.3%. Our installed base surpassed 49,000 tools, during the quarter and grew to nearly 200,000 chambers. Around two thirds of AGS recurring services and parts revenue was delivered as subscription agreements. Finally, AGS continued to produce more than enough operating profit to fund Applied\u2019s growing dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Display, Q1 revenue was $244 million, and segment non-GAAP operating profit was 10.2%. We continue to look forward to our opportunity in the upcoming OLED IT growth inflection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to cash flows in Q1, we generated $2.3 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $966 million to shareholders, including $266 million in dividends and $700 million in buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We repurchased nearly five million shares, at an average price of $152.60.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please note that our Q1 results include the following. First, as we discussed in our recent 10-K report, we increased the estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment and this increased non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. Also effective Q1, we refined the way we allocate stock-based compensation, moving the majority of the expenses from corporate unallocated to the operating segments, which gives managers greater visibility over costs. While the change has no impact on company operating profit or EPS, it reduced the segment operating profit and corporate unallocated costs proportionately. To help you with your segment models, our quarterly earnings presentation includes a table showing what operating profits would have been in fiscal 2022 and in each quarter of fiscal 2023 on a like basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, the reduction in depreciation and share-based compensation, in cost of sales, increased gross margin by approximately 40 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I will share our guidance for Q2. We expect revenue to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.97, plus or minus $0.18. Within this outlook, we expect Semi Systems revenue of around $4.8 billion, AGS revenue of about $1.5 billion and Display revenue of around $150 million. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47.3% and non-GAAP operating expenses to be around $1.235 billion. We are modeling a tax rate of 12.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And now, Mike, let\u2019s begin the Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Brice. Our goal is to help as many of our analysts as possible. With that in mind, please ask just one question on today\u2019s call. If you have another question, please re-queue and we\u2019ll do our best to come back to you later in the session. Operator, let\u2019s please begin.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about DRAM in China. So DRAM was very strong. It was supposed to be strong, but it was quite a bit stronger than, I think, we had thought it was going to be. I guess, can you tell us how much of that was China versus non-China? And going forward, last quarter, you had talked about the expectations for the China piece of that that had been pulled forward due to the sanctions to roll off as we went through the rest of the year. What are your thoughts on that China trajectory, as we go into April quarter and into the second half?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi Stacy, thanks for your question. So in the current \u2013 in the quarter we just closed, we did see high shipments of China DRAM. And it was approximately the same in terms of the higher quantity as we saw in Q4. And just to be clear, we will expect another quarter in Q2, in our outlook quarter that it should remain elevated. I think for the Q4, we had said it was approximately $500 million increase on the DRAM side, that\u2019s probably a good estimate for all of those quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the second part of the question, as we look through the rest of the year, we\u2019ll expect that to normalize. Our China mix should normalize from the levels it\u2019s at right now to something that\u2019s more typical with our average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Which is what? Is that \u2013 what\u2019s the typical?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I would say from a long term \u2013 from a many year perspective, we averaged approximately 30%. So if we\u2019re at 45% right now will decline across the year to somewhere around that level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. That\u2019s helpful guys, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you for taking my question. I was hoping if you could give us your view on how you see the WFE environment in 2024. I think many of your competitors have suggested kind of a low to mid-single-digit growth. But within that, the move towards more leading edge and DRAM and less on the trailing edge, but just given how strongly Applied grew in some of your trailing-edge and ICAPS, how does that position you in this new WFE environment? Because I think, Gary, you said that you only see only limited decline on the ICAPS side. But when I look at the CapEx of many of the auto industrial or analog companies in the U.S., they are cutting it quite sharply. So that\u2019s why I was curious why you think that it\u2019s only going to decline? So just broadly comment on WFE and the different piece parts and then maybe China versus non-China kind of cutting of that. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Vivek. No real change, I think, in our outlook for 2024, in terms of shaping how those end markets are evolving. So, we do think DRAM will continue to be a strong market. We think NAND will improve from its low levels a little bit. We think leading logic will be larger as gate-all-around and new investments start to ramp towards the back half of the year. And we do think there will be some digestion in ICAPS in China, both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to be crystal clear, we had enormous growth for two years in ICAPS and the China-related ICAPS business. And so we won\u2019t see that enormous growth this year. It may be a little bit smaller. We think there\u2019s some digestion with that capacity. But we expect that market to grow over time along with the underlying rates for the company. So that\u2019s \u2013 those \u2013 the shape of those end markets hasn\u2019t changed in our outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So is that consistent with the low-to-mid single-digit WFE, that others are suggesting? Or do you have a different view?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, all we can do is tell you what we see from Applied\u2019s perspective. When we commented on 2023, we said it was a strong year for Applied. And to the way you asked your question, we had strong ICAPS. We had strong DRAM; we were strong in growth in packaging. And so as we look toward 2024, those are the puts and takes. We\u2019re not going to give a precise number for 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Brice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">CJ Muse</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess given the strong outperformance that you showed in 2023, where your silicon business actually grew where I think most people are thinking WFE down in the high single digits. Curious how you\u2019re thinking about 2024? You\u2019ve talked about, clearly, you\u2019re benefiting from share gains across leading-edge foundry-logic and DRAM. But also a vision for ICAPS slowing. So do you think it\u2019s another year of outperformance? Or is it a year of digestion, if you could kind of walk through that? And just as a kind of a bonus question, with SPY [ph] just a little over a week away, would you care to give a preview of what we\u2019ll hear, including a focus on Sculpta? Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So I\u2019ll tackle the first part, and then I know Gary wants to tackle the second part of the question. So on outperforming in 2024, CJ, we do expect, because of our exposure to the fast-growing markets and some of the inflections growing quickly in 2024. We do expect to outperform. We\u2019re not making a call on the size of the market. It\u2019s like you said, there\u2019s a couple of markets that are growing, the ICAPS market and the China piece, we think won\u2019t grow. And so we\u2019re not making a call on which is the stronger trend. And I don\u2019t know if we know. So we\u2019ll see how the year plays out from that perspective. And Gary, on the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi CJ. On \u2013 just let me start on the outperformance. I think the most important thing to think about is, how we\u2019re positioned for major inflections. So if you think about foundry-logic leading edge, gate all around, backside power distribution, those are incremental billion-dollar opportunities for Applied, where we have an opportunity for more than 50% share, which is very accretive to our overall market share. So we\u2019re really well positioned there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ICAPS, we formed that group five years ago, as I said earlier, 20 major new products have been introduced. We have a strong pipeline of future ICAPS products. And so again, they\u2019re \u2013 and we have opportunities to grow in segments like edge and PDC, where we have a lot of momentum. So, I like our position in ICAPS. DRAM, we\u2019ve gained more than 10 points of share over the last 10 years. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, extremely well positioned for the major inflections in DRAM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In packaging, we have the strongest and broadest portfolio. And this is around $1.5 billion of revenue for us in 2024 and an opportunity to double over the next few years. So all of those areas, I think, really set us up for continued outperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on your question about SPIE, one of the things we\u2019ll be talking about there is Sculpta, just reminding people, that\u2019s a breakthrough pattern shaping technology that provides a simpler, faster and more cost-effective alternative to EUV double patterning. So, we\u2019re engaged with all of the leading foundry-logic customers and expanding Sculpta steps for advanced patterning, including High-NA EUV, and we\u2019re also working with customers on new Sculpta applications. And we expect this business to grow to close to $200 million in 2024, in ramp to around $0.5 billion in annual revenue, in the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Also at SPIE, for those of you that will attend, you\u2019ll hear about new edge and CVD technology for patterning that will be very large growth drivers for the company and enable us to continue to outperform. And just for reference, in patterning, we\u2019ve increased our served market from around $1.5 billion, 10 years ago, to $8 billion now and our share from around 10% to 30%. So when Brice said, I was excited, I am absolutely excited these are some really, really great technologies with very strong customer pull and delivering meaningful growth for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Wolfe Research. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Caso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you, good afternoon. I guess the question is kind of looking at the order rates and more importantly, what your customers are telling you as you\u2019re looking into calendar 2025. As you know, some others in the industry with long lead times have started to see some of those green shoots coming into 2025. I know that we\u2019re balancing here between some of your customers burning off capacity and going through technology transitions. What\u2019s the thought as we start to look into 2025, at these early days?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi Chris, thanks for the question. When we look at the market currently, we\u2019re seeing improvements in inventories, and we\u2019re seeing improvements in utilization. So it\u2019s starting to pick up. That\u2019s pretty much across \u2013 that is across the entire market on the utilization side. And then what we\u2019re hearing from customers is optimism, generally speaking, for 2025. We would echo comments we\u2019ve heard from others that the semiconductor end market for devices is expected to be growing. And it\u2019s an investment cycle on the leading edge. We\u2019re expecting the memory markets to continue to improve. So 2025, we are optimistic about the direction for 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Caso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Garry, I had a question for you. You have a broad-based product portfolio. You outperformed WFE last two years. I\u2019m kind of curious for some of these new applications, whether it\u2019s HBM, gate-all-around or even backside power delivery, are customers looking at a one-stop shop? Or more going with best-of-breed solutions? And in other words, let\u2019s say, for gate-all-around, is your strength in Epi helping your edge or ALD products?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Chris, one thing I would say that for all of these inflections, it\u2019s a tremendous advantage for us to have that broad portfolio. Again, when you think about \u2013 one of the examples I\u2019ve used many times is, your processor chip and your smartphone with 15 billion transistors and 60 miles of wiring, which is kind of mind-boggling, when you think about how do we do that? How do we create something like that. There are over 1,500 steps in building that type of chip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when you\u2019re developing these new technologies, like gate-all-around, like backside power or new DRAM technologies or any of these packaging technologies, the ability to combine and co-optimize these steps is an enormous advantage, enormous that 60 miles of wiring, we have one platform that combines seven technologies under vacuum, to enable that those 60 miles long, very thin wires to move the data at super high speeds, very low resistance and very low power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s completely unique. And that\u2019s about one-third of our portfolio are those integrated solutions. We also have clear leadership in eBeam technology. I talked about our cold field emission electron optics. And that enables us to see those structures, when you\u2019re building gate-all-around, and you want to look at the width of those nanosheets, again, we have unique technology that enables us to learn faster and then we can co-optimize all of those technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as we\u2019re driving our innovation with customers, we\u2019re deeper, we\u2019re earlier, we can see four generations out, relative to those technologies. So super, super deep connectivity. That\u2019s why also I think EPIC is going to be a game changer in how we innovate, the way we innovate. We talked about the relationship with Larry [ph] for innovation and edge computing and ICAPs, all of those things, then we have our advanced packaging lab in Singapore that is also a full flow lab, where customers are working on innovation and new architectures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Chris, I think that gives us a tremendous advantage. We can see what\u2019s needed earlier. And then the ability to co-optimize all of that gives us a tremendous advantage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Krish Sankar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Gary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Atif Malik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have a question for Brice. Brice, you talked about China mix normalizing from 45% to 30%. Can you talk about the impact of the mix on the gross margin from the 47.3% you\u2019re guiding through for the rest of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Atif. Appreciate the question. So yes, our gross margin reported in Q1 was 47.9%. We think that we\u2019ve modeled what it would be without the higher China mix, and our view is the underlying gross margin is approximately 46.7% at this point. So as we go through the course of the year, we expect that gross margin to come down from 47.9%, to a more normal amount. At the same time, where we are underneath that, the 46.7% will continue to improve slowly, if that makes sense. So, if you normalize Q1 immediately, you\u2019d be at 46.7%. We expect that to improve through the course of the year. And then we\u2019re not changing our goals. Our goal is 48% to 48.5% for 2025. That\u2019s still where we\u2019re targeting as we work on pricing improvements and continue to work on our cost road map.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Atif, I would just add that we have made progress pretty much across all customers on pricing improvements. I think we\u2019ve talked before about cost headwinds that we encountered in the supply chain. We\u2019re making improvements there, and as Brice said, we\u2019re committed to hit those goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Raymond James. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Srini Pajjuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Hi guys. Gary, I have a question on your HBM comment. I think you said HBM accounted for about 5% of industry output. If you can clarify if that\u2019s wafer output or if that bids, but my question is, as we look out to the next few years I think you\u2019re forecasting about 50% growth for this business. So, it\u2019s a little tricky to understand for us as to how much of DRAM WFE is going to HBM right now? And how do you see that evolving? I mean if the market grows 50%, should we expect I guess the equipment spending also to grow 50%? Or do you think it\u2019s going to grow faster than that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi Srini, since I\u2019ve seen a lot of the modeling, I\u2019ll just share a couple of those data points. So on the first question, its wafer starts when we think about the 5%, its wafer starts. I think it is difficult to estimate the equipment purchases at this point because you probably understand that the DRAM business itself has been underloaded as most of the markets have. So I think what many of the customers are doing is shifting some of their capacity to HBM, to get this output.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gary highlighted in his prepared remarks that the dye sizes for the are larger than the non-HBM. So it certainly will help drive up utilization, which will eventually increase equipment orders going forward. And we do think the DRAM business, if you look at the past few years, the level of WFE for DRAM, we do think that \u2013 it\u2019s been fairly strong, and it will continue to be strong is our expectation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the last piece, of course, is customers are having to expand the HBM related apps of their DRAM process. Gary highlighted what that is for us, and that\u2019s growing a lot faster than what you see on the general Equipment side. So my understanding of the DRAM is about 700 steps in a DRAM process and about 15 additional steps, possibly 20 to do the HBM level of that. So for sure, you\u2019ll see customers growing the HBM packaging techniques and capabilities alongside the regular capacity. And then we\u2019ll expect to see utilization increase as time goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Srini Pajjuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had a two-part question. The first one is on the conventional DRAM part of your business. And the second part is on the NAND business. So the bullishness in terms of HBM, we understand. I\u2019m hoping to better understand what your customers are doing, what they\u2019re telling you, Gary, in terms of their plans on the conventional DRAM side are things still very muted? And are they disciplined from a supply perspective? Or are you seeing a pickup in your conventional DRAM business, as well to the extent you have visibility there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then I guess a similar question on the NAND side. It\u2019s been a soft market for everyone. I guess there\u2019s hope that at least node transitions or layer count increases will resume this year. Are you starting to see early signs of a pickup? Or are things pretty soft there? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Toshiya, its Brice. I\u2019ll just make a couple of comments and maybe Gary will add to that. So, on the DRAM side, and this is true for DRAM and NAND, but I\u2019ll start with DRAM. We do see utilization improving, and we also see improvements in prices, and we also see improvements in inventory positions. So we do think that\u2019s consistent with the rising optimism on the DRAM side. The utilizations have been low enough that there\u2019s a ways to go before they have to start thinking about adding capacity. So our view on the market is it\u2019s mostly from a WFE perspective, the nodal upgrades and the HBM that we talked about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it would be similar for NAND. We\u2019re seeing improvements in inventory, seeing improvements in pricing. Utilization is starting to pick up. And our perspective would be the same as technology advances will be what drives the spending. And we do have signals that, as we suggested that the spending will pick up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Toshiya, relative to Applied in DRAM as I talked about earlier, we\u2019ve gained more than 10 points of overall DRAM WFE share, over the last 10 years. And then if you look at the technologies for DRAM going forward, periphery moving to higher speed IO, enabled by our leadership logic products, capacitor scaling, we\u2019re achieving patterning share gains. And I\u2019ve talked about very strong position in advanced packaging, including high bandwidth memory; we\u2019re really well positioned there to continue our outperformance in DRAM. And as Brice said or I said earlier also, we think that business is going to remain very healthy for us. NAND for Applied, we see the revenue up a fair percentage in 2024 versus 2023, but the total amount is still far below 2022. So that\u2019s a little bit more color.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking y question. One of your peers alluded to this on their last earnings call and talked about a push-out on advanced foundry-logic programs, due to potentially persistent delays in chip sack funding. I mean I think the industry thought that after Congress and the President signed off on the CHIPS Bill, I think it was like 18 months ago that grant funding would be appropriated at least in 2023, but here we are in February 2024 and still no grant disbursements. Obviously, all fab programs will launch at some point, right, but maybe some near-term movements on timing due to the absence of this grant funding. Is that what\u2019s driving some of the leading-edge foundry-logic program delays that you guys talked about in your opening remarks?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Harlan, I\u2019ll make a comment there. I do think those schedule changes that have been in the news, we\u2019re up-to-date on those. So our outlook is consistent with any of those discussions and schedule changes that you\u2019re talking about. On the CHIPS Act, we\u2019ve recently seen news reports about the government beginning to accelerate that process. We\u2019re in the process ourselves of preparing our application on the R&amp;D side and expecting that to open soon. So I think the answer to your question is, yes, it is affecting schedules, but we don\u2019t expect it will change the ultimate destination of those projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harlan Sur</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Quatrochi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could help us quantify how much your ICAPS business grew in calendar 2023. And then as we think about the foundry-logic business for 2024, do you think the recovery in leading-edge can offset the decline in ICAPS?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Joe thanks. So I think what we\u2019ve highlighted publicly on ICAPS is that grew approximately 40% in 2022, and it grew faster than that in 2023. And so we wouldn\u2019t change that and be more specific. But to your point, it\u2019s been the strongest market for us. It\u2019s now the largest market for Applied. Gary highlighted that there\u2019s innovations across that market. It\u2019s very important to us from an investment perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so you\u2019ll see us continue to focus on serving that market and the growth. And then the second part was the linearity across the quarters. We\u2019re not giving guidance across the quarters. But since we did highlight that we expect some digestion in ICAPS, and we highlighted we expect leading edge to accelerate. We\u2019ll leave it to you to kind of think about what \u2013 which is the stronger force and how the next few quarters go forward. But that is the right shape of those two end markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Joe, just let me add. I think our perspective hasn\u2019t changed at all, relative to how we see the market. So we still see semiconductors at $1 trillion by 2030. And if you look at \u2013 there\u2019s some powerful drivers in the digital transformation of every industry. AI, certainly, there\u2019s a lot of focus there. And AI server has 8 times more foundry-logic content and eight times more DRAM compute memory content.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as Brice said earlier, and I think as you\u2019ve heard from others, I think there\u2019s a pretty positive perspective on 2025. And I think longer term we have a very positive perspective relative to semiconductor growth, equipment growing as faster, faster and Applied outgrowing the equipment market continuing to outgrow, as we have for the last five years. So I think quarter-to-quarter or half-to-half, frankly, we don\u2019t focus as much on that, as we do this secular growth that we see in this industry and the great opportunities Applied has, as I\u2019ve talked about, relative to the major inflections. So anyway, that\u2019s the way we think about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Quatrochi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. I had a clarification and a question. So the clarification, Brice, is the 2023 WFE baseline, would you agree with something like $86 billion to $87 billion? So if you can clarify what your baseline is when you say that you gain share? And then my question is on China WFE. So if I use your numbers, it implies WFE from China is roughly $30 billion in 2023, maybe a little bit less. I know the customers are not stockpiling tools per se, but we know that SMIC and some of the other public companies, they have revenue to support what they spend. But that seems like only about half of that amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I guess the question is, would you disagree with the idea that maybe half of what\u2019s coming from China is companies just kind of getting off the ground and trying to displace what\u2019s being imported from the U.S. or Europe. And I guess, Gary, the real crux of the question is that the China stuff is not really a free lunch. It\u2019s sort of duplicative with spending happening elsewhere. So how do you handicap that when you plan your business going forward? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Tim. Thank you. So, on the 2023 WFE, we\u2019ve been careful not to engage in the discussion about that. We just shared what our view of Applied\u2019s performance in our view of that market. And for us, 2023 was a strong year. We talked about ICAPS strength. We talked about DRAM strength, Packaging strength, et cetera. And so we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what the third parties say about the size of the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For us, we saw a strong market. On the China WFE we agree. We don\u2019t see stockpiling. There are a number of new customers. So I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s exactly the partition that you described, in terms of leading and public companies versus not. But, we do think there are a large number of projects that are under investment, where we see over the next four years, added wafer start capacity, planned wafer start capacity that market will be a strong market for us across the planning horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I think it is a mix. You\u2019ve got real demand there. When we look at the macro, we compare the amount of capacity put in place to local China consumption, and we think they\u2019re still behind the amount of local China consumption. So we think the investments are rational. And actually, the utilizations look okay. They\u2019re lower than rest of the world generally speaking, but they\u2019re improving, and we expect yields to be improving also over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then I know, Gary, you\u2019re asking Gary, about the free lunch. We think you\u2019re right from the perspective of no capacity, we\u2019re planning for all of the tools that we sell, whether it\u2019s to China or whether it\u2019s to a government incentivized project. None of these things, we think, increase the amount of equipment installed sort of abnormally such that it\u2019s not going to be used and not going to serve an end market. So we don\u2019t believe that China demand is an end line free launch. We don\u2019t believe the government incentives are a free lunch from that perspective, it\u2019s just affecting a location of needed equipment. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joseph Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I wonder if you could give us some clarity on the $500 million of HBM related revenue that you\u2019re forecasting \u2013 and actually \u2013 that\u2019s a relatively small portion of your overall DRAM run rate, at least. And I guess I would have thought it would be even bigger. Can you talk about that? And then there\u2019s more than just HBM, when it comes to Advanced Packaging for AI DRAM people are doing stacks for other types of memory? Are you \u2013 is that HBM kind of encompassing all of the Advanced Packaging? Or is there other opportunity above and beyond that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Joe. So on the DRAM, I think going back to that Q4, the first quarter, we saw elevated DRAM from the China demand. That was the approximation we used for the impact of that. So you\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s not going to exactly describe every single quarter, but I think that was a good estimate of the incremental that we\u2019re seeing. So we\u2019ll end up with three straight quarters of incremental DRAM shipping to customers in China for those allowed technologies. And Gary, on the...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Joe. On the HBM, again, the HBM packaging is what we talked about increasing to almost $0.5 billion in 2024. And our overall Packaging \u2013 overall Advanced Packaging is around $1.5 billion. So that\u2019s kind of how to think about it. About $0.5 billion in HBM Packaging and the total Advanced Packaging for us is around $1.5 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joseph Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Chin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi there. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting [ph] us ask a question here. Just curious, in route to Applied doing better than the industry over the full year. In terms of the handshake that occurs maybe around midyear, but between some digestion and ICAPS and some pickup in advanced foundry-logic \u2013 but the current timing around this suggest maybe a bigger dip in revenue in the July quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Brian, it\u2019s Brice. So yes, we\u2019re not going to guide future quarters beyond the outlook quarter. So we\u2019ve given you the shape that we think the end markets will take. And to your point, it\u2019s hard to tell which force will be stronger, whether leading \u2013 growing leading edge or a little digestion on the ICAPS side. So we\u2019re not going to call that until we get to those quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Chin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Shi from Needham &amp; Company. Your question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Charles Shi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a long-term question for leading-edge foundry-logic. So you guys talked a lot about the Material engineering potentially driving outperformance. If I look at the back in the last 10 years, I mean, I think the back half of the last decade, I mean, between 2015 and 2019 because the manufacturers kind of slow to jump on to EUV, there was a lot more adoption of multi-pattern. \u2013 actually led to like outperformance of the depth [ph] and edge equipment suppliers like Applied Materials, but the last five years because of the EUV adoption seems to be that trend has reversed a little bit. But looking out for the next five years, I know there are recent discussions about maybe high end EUV may not actually get adopted before 2030. Does that \u2013 does Applied think that may lead to more of the multi-patterning EUV again and that could actually drive up the material engineering intensity again? And any thoughts would be helpful. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Gary Dickerson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question. So one thing I would point to, one of our largest customers, they talked about what\u2019s driving their road map going forward. They talked about something called design technology co-optimization. So what they said basically was that much of the area scaling they were driving going forward is coming from new structures and new materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So an example is backside power you can get 30% area savings through that type of a structure with no change in feature size. So I think what \u2013 certainly, what we see and we\u2019re working with customers for technology nodes out, past the end of the decade, we see the relative contribution of materials innovations spending going higher, the percentage of that going higher. Gate-all-around, backside power, there\u2019s CFAT technology. There\u2019s many different innovations, Packaging technologies. All of those areas, we have over 50% share opportunity in those inflections that are very accretive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, we do see a relative contribution from \u2013 of spending for those innovations to go higher over time. I\u2019ll give you one more data point. So gate-all-around. Gate-all-around is a new innovation and the transistor to process the data faster. We see Gate-all-around ramping to more than $1.5 billion for Applied revenue in 2024 and almost double that amount in calendar 2025. So again, those are \u2013 they\u2019re very powerful new architecture inflections, where Applied is extremely well positioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Charles Shi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Michael Sullivan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Charles. And operator, we\u2019re getting close to the end of the session. So if we have time for one more quick question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly one moment for our final question for today then. And our final question for today comes from the line of Thomas O\u2019Malley from Barclays. Your question please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Thomas O\u2019Malley</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, thanks for sneaking me in. I had another question on kind of the handoff in the first half, for the second half. Clearly, you\u2019re kind of talking about the ICAPS business, getting a little softer in the back half, but leading edge is really picking up slightly offsetting. In terms of where you\u2019re seeing the strength in the leading edge, is that greenfield new fab build-outs or is that existing capacity additions? Any kind of help on where that strength is coming from in the second half would be helpful. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brice Hill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Tom. It\u2019s Brice. Typically, it\u2019s greenfield. So I think that when companies start the first part of a process, you\u2019re typically putting in greenfield and you\u2019ll shift some of your reused equipment later if you\u2019re able to do that. So that would be my expectation. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Thomas O\u2019Malley</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Tom. And appreciate that question. Brice, how would you like to give us your closing thoughts for today?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brice Hill</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Mike. What stands out to me from a summary perspective, is that we\u2019ve anticipated the major market trends and we work closely with our customers to invest in the most important technology inflections. I think will be a major beneficiary, as AI and IoT spending grows over the next several years. Our number one positions in gate-all-around, backside power and advanced packaging are higher than our corporate average, which gives me confidence that we\u2019ll continue to gain share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Beyond our strong portfolio, we\u2019re also making operational progress, which makes me confident we can meet strong demand and make progress in gross margins. Finally, our services growth is accelerating to double digits and generating more than enough profit to fund our growing dividend. Also, I hope to see many of you at the Morgan Stanley conference on March 4. Mike, thank you. Let\u2019s close the call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Sullivan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Brice. And we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today. A replay of today\u2019s call is going to be available on the IR page of our website by 5 o\u2019clock Pacific Time, and we\u2019d really like to thank you for your continued interest in Applied Materials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.</p>", "twitContent": "$AMAT - Applied Materials, Inc.
