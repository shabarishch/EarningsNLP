Welcome to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. This call is being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.</p> <p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Marianne Lake</strong></p> <p></p> <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward looking statements at the back of the presentation</p> <p></p> <p>So if we start on page one, the firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the fourth quarter, or $1.30 a share, with a return on tangible common equity of 14%, on revenues of $24 billion, down 1% year on year, and up 1% quarter on quarter. </p> <p>As you see, we had several significant items in the quarter, which I will review as we go through the presentation in more detail, but they include a $1.3 billion gain on the<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> sale of Visa shares and a $0.5 billion gain on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, both in the corporate segment; as well as $0.8 billion pretax, or a $1.1 billion after-tax impact of legal expense in the quarter, partially booked in mortgage, with the remainder booked in corporate, principally the Madoff settlement recently<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> announced; a $1.3 billion benefit from reduced loan loss reserves in consumer businesses.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in addition, CIB\u2019s results for the quarter include a $2 billion loss for [DVA] and FVA, or funding valuation adjustment, which I will also come back to in more detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The total impact of these items is a negative $0.10 of EPS. So not to diminish their importance, but to illustrate the strength of the core performance of the underlying businesses, if you do adjust our results for these items we would have earned, $5.7 billion less income, $1.40 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So talking about the full year, skipping over page two and straight to page three, reported net income of nearly $18 billion, or $4.35 a share, on revenue of approximately $100 billion, and a return on tangible common equity reported of 11%. Again, if you adjusted for all reported significant items in the year, we would have earned net income of over $23 billion, $5.70 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%. Again, strong underlying performance for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of note, let me talk for a minute about adjusted expenses. You can see on the page that our adjusted expenses, excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure-related matters, are a flat $60 billion. This is in line, albeit at the high end, of our guidance of $59.5 billion to $60 billion for the year. But, included in this number is a total of close to $1 billion of other noncorporate legal expense, which, if we had adjusted, would have left a more core number at just over $59 billion, despite the incremental investment in controls of $1 billion that we made in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So briefly recapping on 2013, clearly a year marked by regulatory developments and significant legal settlements. However, more importantly, also a year in which our businesses, together and individually, performed strongly. We succeeded in further progressing our customer satisfaction agenda and gaining market share across businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2013 saw very strong credit performance across businesses, including significant improvements in mortgage. And finally, we ended the year with strong capital liquidity and margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So let\u2019s talk about capital on page four. I\u2019m not going to talk much about Basel I except to say that you can see we progressed our ratio in the quarter to 10.7% Basel I tier one common. But importantly, if you look at the middle section, you see that our Basel III tier one common ratio is 9.5%, meeting our year-end target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a few words on the components underlying this ratio. Three things: first, we generated approximately $5 billion of net capital in the quarter. Second, we also saw significant RWA benefit of model and parameter updates, including HPI and lower spreads, as well as portfolio runoff. And third, these positives together, worth over 60 basis points of improvement, were reduced by about 50 basis points due to higher levels of operational risk capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The significant increase in operational risk capital this quarter is largely driven by the inclusion of the large legal expense from the prior quarter. We will spend some more time on capital at investor day, but despite headwinds, we still anticipate reaching 10% plus or minus Basel tier one three common by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A quick update on leverage. Both the firmwide and the bank supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules increased to 4.7%. I\u2019ll come back on the next page to talk about the final Basel SNL framework that was issued this weekend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, the holding company converted [certain] into company debt at the bank into capital, improving the bank\u2019s relative ratio. We remain compliant with LCR at the firm level this quarter, including the impact of the proposed new rules, and we continue to have about 19% of available resources relative to risk-weighted assets at the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before we move on, as you know, the Volcker Rule was finalized in the quarter, and having had the opportunity to consider the rule, some thoughts. The certainty provided by having a final rule, and the implementation date of July 15, were welcome. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is a tough rule, and the regulators have laid out stringent standards for compliance policies, procedures, controls, and testing, which will bring operational challenges to implement. However, we believe that the firm will be materially compliant across our businesses with the rule. We have work to do to get there, but we don\u2019t expect any material impact to our results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s take a closer look at the impact of the final SLR framework from this weekend, on [unintelligible]. As you saw, the Basel committee released the framework this weekend, which has gone a long way towards closing the gap relative to the U.S. NPR. And the changes they made are responsive to industry feedback and seem sensitive to potential market impacts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our initial analysis estimates that the impact will worsen both the holding company and bank ratios by only approximately 10 basis points relative to U.S. proposed rules, so that would be 4.6% for each of the holding company and the bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This impact is primarily driven by a positive related to improved assumptions on unfunded commitments being slightly more than offset by the inclusion of written credit protection provisions, previously not in the U.S. rules. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, between the likely implementation in the future of NIM for derivatives\u2019 potential future exposure and the ability over time for us to improve [unintelligible] for cash collateral, there should be significant improvement opportunity ratio in terms of basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, our leverage action plans don\u2019t change materially. We\u2019ll be thoughtful and measured about implementation in 2014 and beyond, and our perspective on specific products and businesses is not just driven by capital implications, but also by the importance to the broader franchise and client relationships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do expect to reach 5% plus or minus at the holding company by the end of this year and to be compliant at the bank shortly thereafter. The next step is for the U.S. regulators to determine when and if they\u2019ll adopt this new denominator, although we feel it\u2019s reasonably likely that they will.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, over the weekend there was a consultation paper issued on NSFR. The proposal more closely aligns NSFR to the current evolved LTR framework in terms of definitions and assumptions, which is a positive step. And, based upon the proposal, we estimate that the firm is compliant today with NSFR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to business performance, let\u2019s start with the consumer and community banking on page six. The combined consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue with a return on equity of 20%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of comments on drivers. We continue to make strong progress, as I said, on our customer satisfaction agenda, being recognized by the American Consumer Satisfaction Index for the second year running as number one among the largest banks, as well as number one in small business in three of four regions in the U.S. and number one among large banks for mortgage originations, both by JD Power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On our retail branch network, we\u2019ve completed building out our key expansion markets, including California and Florida, and have reached leadership positions in each of our key markets. So we feel good about our footprint at or around this level of 5,600 branches plus or minus, and our focus from here is on optimization, including branch size and usage, and leveraging digital capabilities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, our other key business drivers continue to grow strongly, reflecting increased consumer engagement, evidenced by growth in deposits, investments, sales, and processing volumes. And our expenses are down nearly $700 million from last year, primarily due to lower mortgage bank expenses. Across CCB, we\u2019ve reduced headcount by 16,500 year over year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to page seven, consumer and community banking generated net income of $780 million and an ROE of 28% on net revenue of $4.4 billion, up 4% and flat with the prior quarter. Net interest income is up 3% year on year, driven by the continued strong growth in deposits, partially offset by spread compression. It\u2019s our investment in customer satisfaction, newbuilds, and CPC that is driving this deposit growth, and also the highest account retention rate in a decade. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the noninterest revenue side, we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue, with close to $190 billion of client investment assets, up 19% or $30 billion year over year, about half related to market performance and half due to net new money gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses are up 3% year on year, reflecting costs relating to the strengthening of the control environment, but have flattened sequentially as we improve efficiency in our same store branches, with starting down by over 6,000 year over year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Business banking loan balances are flat quarter on quarter and up 1% year on year, and production levels in the pipeline remain stable. However, the environment has been challenging throughout the year due to competitive pressures, and we\u2019ve maintained a high level of credit discipline. But we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll see small businesses start to spend some of their cash reserves in 2014, but growth may be back ended. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to page eight, mortgage banking, overall, mortgage banking net income was $562 million with an ROE of 11%. There are a couple of nonrecurring items this quarter, which I\u2019ll explain as we go through the results, but if you look at the top of the page, you\u2019ll see production [ex repurchases] with a reported pretax loss of $500 million. But if you look at the table at the top right, we\u2019ve adjusted for the one-time items, and you can see a loss of $91 million, slightly negative, as expected, and as we guided to. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenues in the quarter were down 15% on lower application volumes, down 23%, and from a mix perspective, nearly 60% of loans were purchased loans this quarter, up from a little over 20% the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Production expense includes approximately $400 million of non-MBS-related legal expense. This is part of the significant item on the front page. Again, adjusting for this, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of actions we\u2019ve taken to reduce expenses, with adjusted expenses coming down around $80 million quarter over quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dealing with repurchases, as you know, during the quarter we reached a settlement with the GSEs on agency repurchase exposure. After allowing for the settlement amount, we are releasing a net $130 million of repurchase reserves this quarter, with $90 million being added to compensatory fee reserves as the settlement did not cover these potential fees. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And before moving on to servicing, just looking out to the first quarter of 2014, the overall mortgage market is estimated to be roughly flat versus the fourth quarter. And although we do expect to see some continuation in expense improvement, revenues will continue to be challenged. And we\u2019re guiding for the first quarter, similar to the last two quarters, to be slightly negative in pretax productions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to servicing, pretax income about breakeven in the quarter. Servicing expenses of $663 million includes that $90 million of compensatory fee expense that I just mentioned, which related to loans previously contemplated in the repurchase reserves. Adjusting for this item, our core expenses would have been slightly better than our previous guidance of $600 million for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, on real estate portfolio, pretax income of $1.2 billion, including chargeoffs of $167 million and a total reserve release of $950 million. The noncredit impaired reserve release for the quarter was $200 million, reflecting continued improvements in the portfolio, but at a lower rate, but also we released $750 million of reserves in the purchase credit impaired portfolio, given recent significant improvements in HPI forecasts of approximately 5% for our portfolio through 2015. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to page nine, [unintelligible] merchant services and auto, net income of $1 billion, up 23% year on year, with an ROE of 26% or 22% excluding reserve releases, reflecting underlying excellent performance in the business. Consumer spending has been increasing, and we\u2019re seeing strong growth in interchange revenue, reflecting growth in sales volume as well as seasonality in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year over year, growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was consistently strong at 11% and 14% respectively, with average outstandings flat year over year and quarter over quarter, yields remaining healthy but lower than a year ago. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do continue to see runoff of high rate and low FICO balances, with a move towards more engaged customers or transactors, which is a positive trend for spend and for credit performance but a negative to yield, and we expect spread compression to continue into 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net revenues of $4.7 billion, down 3% year over year and up 1% quarter on quarter on seasonality, with a revenue rate of 12.34% for the quarter. Consistent with these portfolio trends, the net chargeoff rate has stayed at historical lows at 2.85% and we released $300 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, given improved delinquencies and portfolio seasoning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses are up 3% year on year, about 16% quarter on quarter, primarily driven by increased marketing investment spend and costs associated with payments to customers required by a consent order.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few words on auto. Originations are up 16% year on year, driving loan balances up 5% year on year and outpacing new car sales growth of 5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And before we move on, as you know, there were two data security breaches affecting our customers over the last several weeks. We took quick action to protect our customers, and we continue to monitor both situations. The financial impact for the quarter is not significant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to slide 10 and the corporate investment bank, the CIB results this quarter include a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing the FVA, or funding valuation, framework, as well as a $0.5 billion DVA loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On this page, we\u2019ll focus on the numbers excluding FVA and DVA, in the table on the top right. And I\u2019ll come back to FVA on the next page. So you have net income of $2.1 billion on revenues of $8 billion and an ROE of 15%. And we maintained our number one ranking in both global IBCs and markets revenue, gaining share year over year of over 100 basis points in each.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In banking, total revenue of $3 billion, with IBC slightly ahead of our guidance. IBCs of $1.7 billion for the quarter up 11% quarter on quarter and down 3% year on year, driven by lower debt underwriting compared with a record prior year quarter, partially offset by strength in equity underwriting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Treasury services revenue of $1 billion, down 7% year on year, driven primarily by the decision to reposition our trade loan portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to markets and investor services, our markets revenue of $4.1 billion was flat year on year, also slightly ahead of the guidance we provided in the fourth quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fixed income markets revenues of $3.2 billion, flat year on year, with continued solid client flows. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And equity markets of $873 million, down quarter on quarter off of a very strong equity derivatives result last quarter, as well as seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Security services revenue of $1 billion, up 3% year on year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services revenue on record assets under custody of $20.5 trillion and also on higher deposits. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a comment on credit. We continue to see a favorable credit environment with stable credit quality trends, and our provisions continue to benefit from repayments and recoveries. Expenses of $4.9 billion, down 2% both year over year and quarter over quarter, driven by lower compensation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The comp to revenue ratio, excluding FVA and DVA, was 27% for the quarter, in line with the same quarter last year and 30% for the full year, which is in line with our guidance, albeit at the lower end, on higher capital year over year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Loan balances are down 7% year on year, flat quarter on quarter, again primarily driven by trade loan balances, which could trend down or continue to trend down as we optimize the portfolio. And at the bottom of the driver section, VAR remains low at $42 million for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to page 11, and coming back to the FVA adjustment, we\u2019re recording a $1.5 billion loss as a result of implementing a funding valuation, or an FVA, framework for our OTC derivatives and structured notes this quarter, reflecting and industry migration towards incorporating the lifetime cost or benefit of unsecured funding into valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple of minutes on the background and dealing with why now. To date, there\u2019s been no broad consensus that funding should be explicitly incorporated into valuation estimates. However, we believe that market practice for pricing and valuing derivatives has noticeably evolved during 2013 as we\u2019ve been actively and continuously evaluating the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve now accumulated compelling evidence, both from transactions as well as industry pricing services, that dealers are pricing funding into uncollateralized derivatives with a degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA framework this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In very simple terms, you can think of FVA, which represents a funding spread over LIBOR, as having the effect of present valuing market funding costs into the value of derivative receivables today. These funding costs otherwise would have affected net income over the life of the derivatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Although the FVA framework applies to both assets and liabilities, the adjustment in the quarter is largely related to uncollateralized derivative receivables for two reasons. First, the funding value of collateral is already incorporated in the valuation of collateralized derivatives, and second, credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding spreads, are already recorded on liabilities through DVA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in thinking about the size of the adjustments, you have to consider the size, the tenure, the composition of the relative portfolio, as well as the appropriate spread. To give you some context, if you start with derivative receivables net of cash and securities collateral of approximately $50 billion, apply an average duration of approximately five years and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that accounts for about $1 billion plus or minus the adjustment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, although there is a material overlap between DVA and FVA, the remaining difference contributes to the adjustment. So the loss in the quarter represents a transition adjustment to this new framework, and can be thought of a one-time event as we incorporate the concept into the portfolio value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going forward, FVA will be incorporated into day one valuation of derivatives and implementing FVA should have the effect of significantly reducing our sensitivity to funding spreads going forward. We\u2019ll continue to refine FVA as the framework matures within the industry. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to page 12, the commercial bank saw a net income of nearly $700 million this quarter on revenue of $1.8 billion, with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were up 6% year on year and 7% quarter on quarter, net interest income increasing by 5% year over year, reflecting a one-time gain of approximately $100 million related to a lending-related workout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pricing spreads have continued to tighten across the board. Noninterest revenues were 8% up year on year, driven by record growth IBCs of over $500 million for the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our credit book continues to show very strong performance, with a net chargeoff rate of only 7 basis points, as we continue to focus on quality names and a comfortable parting on deals that don\u2019t meet our standards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses were up 9% year on year, continuing to reflect higher product and headcount related expenses, primarily in controls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Loan balances were up 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Our commercial real estate businesses continued to outperform the industry, up 15% year on year, 16 consecutive months of growth. But in C&amp;I, overall loan growth remains flat, performing slightly below the industry as client demand continues to be low, competition high, and we remain focused on credit discipline over growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While sentiment remains fragile, there are pockets of activity, and we are cautiously optimistic that borrowing demand may improve as confidence in the recovery spreads. But again, that may be back ended in the year as clients are very liquid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, deposits are up 3% year on year and 4% quarter on quarter, on seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Page 13, in asset management, continued strong investment performance and long term [unintelligible] drove the fourth consecutive year of record revenue. The quarter saw net income of $568 million, up 18% year over year, with an ROE of 25%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Record revenues of $3.2 billion, up 15% year on year, are driven by three main factors: strong fund performance as well as long term flows in every single asset class and from every region, overall benefitting from higher markets, and finally a mark-to-market gain from [received cash] on investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is the 19th consecutive quarter of long term inflows, with $16 billion for the quarter, bringing the full year to a total of $90 billion, driving record assets under management of $1.6 trillion, up 12%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw particular strength in multiasset and equities, and achieved number one ranking in 2013 for net flows in active long term mutual funds. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Expenses increased in line with performance of the business. And finally, in banking we continue to see growth across the board, with record loan balances over $95 billion, up 19% year on year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Page 14. A total net income of nearly $800 million for corporate and private equity for the quarter. In private equity, a relatively quiet quarter, with aggregate results more modest than in prior quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Treasury CIO showed a net loss of $78 million, driven by negative NII of nearly $100 million. But that compares to a run rate of negative NII of approximately $500 million in each of the first two quarters. This improvement reflects the benefit of higher investment security deals, up 50 basis points. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The investment securities portfolio has also been a significant contributor to firm-wide NIM stability, and in the second half of the year we deployed $66 billion growth in new investments, principally mortgages and munis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our ending balance of securities classified as held to maturity grew to $24 billion and will continue to grow this quarter. And you should expect CIO treasury NII to reach breakeven in the second half of 2014, all other things equal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I continue, just let me talk for a second about NIM and NII, details of which are in the appendix. Firm-wide NIM, core NIM, and NII were all up slightly quarter over quarter, given market rates, and we expect both NIM and NII to be relatively stable in the near term, with the highest security deals I talked about being largely offset by loan spread compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally on this page are the corporate, sees a net income of $852 million, and there\u2019s a callout on the page. First, a net gain - all of these are after tax - of $800 million on the sale of Visa shares. We were, and we remain, a large Visa shareholder. However, in the quarter we saw the opportunity to risk manage approximately one-third of our Visa price risk exposure. But we clearly retain the ongoing litigation risks, both the ultimate amount and timing of the settlement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Secondly, a net real estate gain of over $300 million on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza, and these two gains are being offset by nearly $800 million in legal expense, substantially all Madoff related. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, a few positive tax items in the quarter, largely the resupply reserves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Page 15 in our outlook, to wrap up, we\u2019ve actually covered all of the items on this page. So wrapping up, just to say that our four leading franchises are all performing very strongly, and we remain focused on serving our clients. We\u2019re committed to accomplishing our control agenda and adjusting successfully to the new global financial architecture, and we look forward to diving deeper into all of these things at investor day, which is coming up in a few weeks\u2019 time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, thank you, and operator, you could open up the line to Q&amp;A. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just wanted to talk about the leverage ratio for a moment. You talked about a 10 basis point increase from the latest on Basel, if they do the add-ons. And I guess the big part that\u2019s hardest for us to see is really the impact of the CDS non-netting of mismatched maturities on protection bought versus protection sold. Can you give us a sense of what your numbers look like on that basis, so we can try and reconcile to your 10 basis points?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick thing, just to clarify, the 10 basis points is actually lower, not higher. It\u2019s a deduct not an add for the new Basel proposals relative to the U.S. rules. So remember, as we\u2019ve previously been [disclosing] our ratios, we used the U.S. proposed rules that referenced a prior Basel denominator. So it\u2019s a 10 basis point worsening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019re right that we had two major things contributing to that. We had a positive associated with better assumptions on draws on unfunded commitments, slightly more than offset by a negative on the [unintelligible] protection. We\u2019re still working through the final details, but our best estimate is that it\u2019s in the mid-20s in basis points, 25 basis points plus or minus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And can you just give us a sense for what the maturity profile looks like on your CDS protection purchased versus sold? Is there much of a maturity mismatch there? Or is there really not much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you start with our [gross growth] CDS protection [written], it\u2019s about $3.4 trillion. By the time you net that down for maturities, it gets down to a couple hundred billion dollars, but that\u2019s still impactful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another thing to think about, it will be manageable because this is kind of a static analysis, before we started running the business slightly differently due to it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. We saw the proposals as having been thoughtful. And we don\u2019t necessarily have to agree with the finer points of all of them, but it doesn\u2019t materially change our position or our our thoughts going forward. And as Jamie says, all of our businesses will now socialize and optimize against what we understand of the final rules, when the U.S. regulators adopt them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the $60 billion of core expense that you pointed out, on balance having been pretty flat with last year, despite the increases in control environment costs, can you give us a sense of how you currently see that evolving in 2014?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re obviously going to do a bit more of a detailed deep dive on expenses over time at investor day. But for now, what we have said is that you should expect our adjusted expenses for 2014 to remain at or below that level of $60 billion. We also said that in 2014 the continuation of our control agenda is adding an incremental $1 billion over \u201913. So by remaining flat, we\u2019re effectively self-funding that $1 billion. Flat to down. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And how do you get comfortable that by doing that you\u2019re not going to eat into revenue growth, by starving other expenses?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re not starving any expenses. We\u2019re just managing it in a disciplined way, the way we\u2019ve always done it. And if you look at the underlying numbers, there\u2019s a lot of growth in the underlying numbers. But it\u2019s clearly true that some of the derisking and spinning off OEP and physical commodities will affect revenues a little bit, but obviously profits less. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve always been investing in the businesses and been willing to invest where the business pace and the returns justify that. But we are also finding efficiencies in a combination of the businesses, both consumer and the wholesale businesses, efficiency in the same store branches we talked about. You know, CIB continues on its journey on the back office and front office integration, and obviously mortgage expenses will continue to trend down, both in line with improved credit trends and also as we proactively manage the portfolio. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, but it\u2019s not at the expense of our willingness to invest in the businesses for returns. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I can follow up on the mortgage expense comment that you made, more just along the lines of the expenses against the origination franchise, it sounded to me like you may be extending your view of what the timeframe is to kind of get that to steady state, beyond the first quarter? Is that right, or am I misreading that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not just about expenses. I think you have to think about the whole equation. We\u2019ll see some improvement in the first quarter of 2014, and we\u2019ll also continue to work on expense efficiency in the business. But if you look at a market that is currently being estimated at about $1.3 trillion, down from $1.9 trillion - and honestly a couple of weeks ago it was $1.1 trillion, so it\u2019s a very small market, one we haven\u2019t seen the likes of since the year 2000 - in a market like that, it\u2019s very challenging to deliver through the cycle returns. So we went through, over the last few years, years with very strong revenues and margins, and we are in a challenging environment as we look into 2014. But we\u2019re working on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the last one for me, you mentioned the impact of operating risk due to the very high level of litigation costs this year. How should we think about that, and how are you thinking about that, with respect to CCAR?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The way to think about it in the short term relative to, say, the submission that we just did or in the near future, is that obviously a realized loss experience that is higher than we have previously seen informs your view and judgment as to what you could reasonably expect to happen in a future stress period. So it is fair to say that would drive our expectations for [unintelligible] on operational losses to be slightly higher. Having said that, it\u2019s not as if our previous submissions didn\u2019t contemplate there to be significant stresses in operating losses. So I would characterize it as incremental and certainly not from a low base. And also remember that every quarter we move forward we generate capital, improve our ratios, so there\u2019s lots of moving parts to the ultimate outcome. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One was on NIM outlook. You did indicate that in the second half of \u201914 you were expecting that the CIO and treasury income would turn positive, if I read it correctly. And I would think that\u2019s a function of your security yields improving. Can you just give us a sense of what the new investment yield is for the security investments that you\u2019re making in that book right now relative to what the balances are at?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the way you\u2019re supposed to look at it is something like $40 billion gets reinvested a year. And the basic assumption you should make is an average duration of three or four years. So think of five-year bonds or something like that. And just use the implied yield curve. [unintelligible] munis or MBS or something like that. The other thing to point out is it\u2019s completely dependent upon the decisions we make. We can change that kind of at will if we want to extend or reduce the duration of equity at the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so given your comments that you\u2019re expected to reach breakeven by the second half of \u201914, that\u2019s a reflection of higher interest rates, or a change in the way you\u2019re investing the funds? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a little bit of both. It\u2019s mostly just the change in the yield curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we\u2019ll have slower mortgage repayments. We\u2019re able to reinvest at higher yields. We\u2019re reinvesting in high quality assets, munis at high spreads. So it\u2019s both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then your other point was you\u2019re going to be taking that better return on that portfolio and using it to be as competitive as you want to be on the loan portfolio, and so expectation is that loan spreads will continue to pull down over the next couple of quarters at least. Can you just give us a sense as to how willing you are to be competitive on price in loan spreads? Should we be expecting that overall NIM compression is what you\u2019re looking for here in the event that you get the quality loan growth you want?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, you\u2019ve got to separate the loans. On the commercial side, we\u2019ll obviously be competitive, and we\u2019re not assuming anything heroic in terms of spreads getting worse or better. But they\u2019re low. You could argue down the road they might actually go up a little bit as capital requirements, liquidity requirements go way up. But we\u2019ll be competitive. We\u2019re assuming we\u2019ve got to be competitive in those spreads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on the consumer side, card balances have been rewritten post crisis to be variable. Are you anticipating that you\u2019re going to be in a rising rate environment, [in the belly of the curve], raising rates on card portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Think of the card business as we try to run it fully match funded, so the spreads are about the same. And just remember, something like 65% is at an interest rate, something like 40% is transactor almost locked in rates, which we also match fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then separate topic, just on the security breach that you discussed. You indicated that the card replacements that you\u2019ve done so far has been de minimis in terms of expense. But could you just speak about it a little bit bigger picture, how you\u2019re thinking about fraud in the card space as well as in the debit space?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have replaced 2 million debit and credit cards I think by the end of this week, to protect our customers. Look, unfortunately, the cybersecurity, as we\u2019ve now pointed out for a year, is a big deal. It\u2019s not going to go away. And all of us have a common interest in being protected. So this might be a chance for retailers and banks to for once work together as opposed to sue each other like we\u2019ve been doing the last decade. But it\u2019s in all of our interest to do it, and I think all the people involved in this know that the third parties, whether it\u2019s machines, regional machines, your mainframes, you really have to put an extreme effort into protecting yourself. So this story is not over, unfortunately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right, and there\u2019s been this debate between tokenization versus chip and PIN, and I\u2019m just wondering do you guys have an angle as to which way you would prefer to see it go?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Honestly, I think you\u2019re going to see both. You\u2019re going to see chip and PIN in all cards, and then a lot of online type of transactions you\u2019re going to see tokenization. They both are very very good technologies to protect consumers and companies from fraud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just last question, on the Visa, did I hear you correctly, Marianne, that you basically realized a third of the economic value in the Visa shares that you have? Is that correct?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, that\u2019s correct. <strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So two thirds left. And when you say economic, you\u2019re talking about net of any hedging?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s an unrealized gain of approximately $3 billion today. It\u2019s on our books at zero. This goes back to when Visa was spun off many, many years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But that\u2019s right, Betsy, net of hedging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question, on FIC in the IB. It\u2019s pretty stable this quarter. As a matter of fact, if you look for the year, it was about in line with last year, which I think once everybody\u2019s done reporting, it will be a pretty good victory. So I guess the question is, there\u2019s a bunch of structural headwinds blowing on the business, and as you do your budgeting - it\u2019s probably done already - can the industry grow with the headwinds on it? In other words, the offset would be better activity levels, steeper curve, things like that. But there\u2019s a bunch of structural headwinds. I\u2019m just curious how you think about it at the high level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are some structural headwinds. You\u2019ve seen a lot of adjustment in the marketplace. People have reduced the size of their inventory. But what you don\u2019t know going forward is what\u2019s going to happen to spreads. But I look at it a little bit like the sector\u2019s on a cyclical. There will be headwinds from regulations, etc., but over time assets that people need to manage and buy and sell are going to go up over time, not go down. So what happens in 2014 is hard to say. Our business is fairly diversified, between rates, credit, emerging markets, FX, commodities, etc., which is definitely helping that stability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe on a related note, I got a sense with the renewed focus on SLR that there\u2019s a renewed attention to compression trades. I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s ongoing, and it could be material in 2014 as this goes on? I know there\u2019s a lot of work involved, but the reward is pretty good too. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say it\u2019s ongoing, and it will be benefit. I think material might be a stretch at this point. And it is a lot of work, as you say. So the whole industry is working on that, and us too. We expect it to be beneficial, but not a game-changer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The SLR at 5% we do not think is going to be an issue for us. We\u2019ve barely begun to manage it. There are a lot of things you can do in how you change your business. The bank issue is a little bit different, but think of that as more structural. What we did in the bank over the last 20 years, and what we\u2019re not going to do in the bank going forward, that will take a little bit longer, but for other reasons. It just takes us longer to change our business model to accommodate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I also think if you look at the other things I mentioned in terms of opportunities, putting NIM to one side, our estimate of the new Basel rule that we had, we\u2019ve given you a 10 basis point movement backwards, have a conservative estimate of what we could ultimately achieve over time in terms of the ability to net cash collateral for derivatives, just given certain of the conditions. But again, over time, that will also be manageable, like compression trades and like many of those other things. So we haven\u2019t changed our view. We can manage against these targets by doing it thoughtfully and methodically, and not having to [unintelligible].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Glenn Schorr - ISI </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last one for me. You\u2019ve noted you\u2019re 9.5% [unintelligible] tier one common, the 10% year-end target seems completely achievable given your earnings. I\u2019m just curious how you think about balancing the absolute versus the relative meaning. You can get there on an absolute basis no problem. On a relative basis, some other large financial institutions have a little bit more. Just curious if that matters as you talk about the capital planning process, or when you have enough, it\u2019s enough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We said already that we would be willing to run between 10% and 10.5%, so we\u2019re on a journey here. We think we can get 10% plus or minus by the end of this year. It could be plus and it could be minus. But we think that at this point, based on what we know, running at that level of buffer or margin should be enough. Obviously we\u2019ll be more informed as we go through CCAR processes, but that\u2019s our point of view at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One more quick follow up on the net interest margin outlook. NIM expected to be flattish. But I wasn\u2019t clear if, in the current rate environment, you expected to continue to add investments as you have been doing. And would you expect the net interest income dollars to grow from here as they did slightly this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I talked about the second half of the year growth, adding $66 billion. We\u2019ve never talked about the second quarter. We added quite a lot in the second quarter. And yes, we have plans to continue to do that in 2014. And yes, we expect our NII dollars to be relatively stable, possibly slightly up over the course of the first half of the year, but relatively stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And not [unintelligible] investments. If you look at the balance sheet today, we have almost $350 billion at central banks, mostly the Fed, another $350 billion of very high quality investment securities. And those two things combined equal our loans of $700 billion. So the company is very, very liquid. We don\u2019t really need to invest more. It depends on how much we grow deposits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what about just taking advantage of the 10-year yields moving up and your overall sensitivity to higher rates?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I already said what we\u2019re going to do is, what you should assume now is that there\u2019s implied yield curves and constant reinvestment, but if you had rates move up 100 basis points all at once, we probably would be much more aggressive in doing something like that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in terms of the litigation reserves, you resolved a number of large issues in the fourth quarter. So two questions here. Can you help us think about how the litigation provision expense might trend in 2014? Should we expect it to be lower than the $800 million? And then second, can you tell us if your range of possible loss has come down from the $6.8 billion that it stood at in October, since you resolved a few big items?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously you\u2019re going to understand the necessary caveat that we can\u2019t predict for you the pattern and the amount of legal expenses in any one quarter or over several quarters. However, it would be fair to say that we would certainly hope that for the full year the full year [unintelligible] the first quarter annualized, but we can\u2019t be certain of that. With respect to a reasonably possible loss range, it did come down from $5.7 billion at the end of the third quarter to $5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, given the legal expense [unintelligible].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the last thing is, you mentioned it a little bit, but can you just give us kind of a philosophy with which you approached this year\u2019s CCAR and how you\u2019re thinking about balancing your capital achievement goals on the ratios that you talked about with the goal of returning some capital to shareholders?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve done a bunch of math. You can do it based on analysts\u2019 estimates. But if you think about we want to get to 10% plus or minus before the end of next year, all other things being equal, that is a priority, but it is not the only priority. And so as we think about our capital plan, we\u2019ve consistently said - obviously it\u2019s a board decision ultimately, and they\u2019ll contemplate them in the [unintelligible], of course - but we would like to have the flexibility to be able to potentially increase dividends and also have flexibility to be able to do reasonable repurchases. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for you to think about how we thought about this year as being relatively consistent with last.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a question on the announcement of the potential for selling the prepaid card business. I\u2019m just curious as to what drove that, given that it doesn\u2019t appear that it was a scale-related decision, given the size of that business relative to peers. But if you could just provide a little more color as to what you\u2019re seeing in that business and what caused you to potentially sell that business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Every year we try to have a disciplined approach about what we stay in and what we don\u2019t, and I think we probably were more disciplined this year about the things we don\u2019t need, both from derisking, capital, management focus, controls, etc. If you look at the prepaid card business, we\u2019re not dealing directly with customers. It\u2019s kind of secondary. It\u2019s a complex business, and we were just better off letting someone else do it. It won\u2019t affect the four main franchises that Marianne spoke about, that are doing so well. It was just kind of a product we used to do, and so we\u2019re not going to do it anymore. And there\u2019s a lot of risk associated with it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just moving on to your comments about being potentially cautiously optimistic about back-end growth for loans, presuming that that\u2019s mostly focused on commercial lending. Is it still your view that the canary in the coal mine for seeing that might be slower deposit growth, or in fact negative deposit growth, before you start to see loan growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We didn\u2019t use the word cautiously optimistic, we\u2019re using the word optimistic, because we are actually optimistic. You have a U.S. economy starting to grow. You will see loan growth and volume growth across all of these businesses. We are actually optimistic about the U.S. economy in particular. We spend a lot of time analyzing what rising rates, growth, change of QE3, [unintelligible] will do to the deposits. So it might actually have a diminishing effect on the growth of deposits. But we\u2019re happy, [whether we\u2019re] still growing share. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to see deposits going negative before you see loan growth. I think you\u2019re trying to fine tune it too closely there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fair enough. And then just finally, in terms of your outlook for card balances, just trying to take some of the fourth quarter seasonality out of that business, that they have sort of bottomed in terms of the overall balances. Are you equally optimistic for those balances to begin to grow in 2014? Or are you still looking at sort of flattish balances through most of 2014?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remember that in our card business we have both dynamics of core [unintelligible] as well as still some continued runoff. We did reach the inflection point during the second half of 2013 where that runoff was no longer exceeding growth. And so we\u2019re set to grow, but very modestly, in 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But more importantly, 93% of the business is rewards. We\u2019ve had 10% growth in spend, we\u2019ve had 14% growth in merchant processing. So we are very happy with the card business. It\u2019s performing exceptionally well, excellent credit trends. So outstanding growth is less important, but obviously we\u2019d like to see some of that too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just finally for me, given some of the security breaches, not only in your cards but across a couple of other issuers, have you seen any reduction in consumer spending, potentially related to that via cards, moving to other forms of purchases? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. Just a little bit relating to Target, but not in general. And a lot of that card growth is coming from P&amp;E and travel and restaurants and things like that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore Partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding expenses, can you remind us where we stand on headcount reductions through \u201913 and then where you stand in terms of on track for \u201914?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, just to remind you what we said back in February last year, in the consumer businesses we talked about over the two years, so \u201913 and \u201914, mortgage seeing headcount reductions of 13,000 to 15,000, and the consumer businesses, predominantly in the branches, of 4,000. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By the end of 2013, we had seen 16,500 in total. So in the consumer bank, we\u2019ve actually not only accelerated, but outperforming our expectations in terms of our ability to run those branches efficiently and still maintain very strong customer satisfaction and retention rates. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in the mortgage space, we have seen total headcount down 11% year over year against that 13,000 to 15,000 two-year target. So obviously we continue to work on the strategy and the size and our approach to the mortgage market, but obviously relative to those numbers, there\u2019s still a little way to go. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And remember that that was both production and servicing. What you saw, given the rate environment in the middle of 2000 and the second half of 2013, is that some of the production related headcount reductions were accelerated. We still have meaningful improvement expected in terms of delinquencies and foreclosures and modifications that will continue to drive costs and headcount down in \u201914.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in terms of the retail branch banking discussion that you had mentioned you\u2019re kind of comfortable with the 5,600 branches level that you\u2019re at now, and you\u2019re focused on optimization going forward, does that imply that you could see additional headcount reductions or shrinkage of the branch network or square footage, as we\u2019ve seen from others? How should we think about that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Talking about the number of branches, I would think about the fact that, like all those sort of retail distributions, houses will continue to do consolidations and relocations as it makes sense for us to do that in our footprint, and we\u2019ll continue to respond to customer preferences, which will mean that over the course of the next decade, we\u2019ll be looking at obviously the size of new branches, as branches come up for renovation and release and things like that. But we\u2019re not expecting a material change in the number as a macro matter. So 5,600 plus or minus. And it is going to be based on customer preferences. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to headcount reductions, we\u2019re already aggressively looking at the efficiency in our same store branches, and have been very successful. So we are looking at staffing models, physical capabilities, automation. We\u2019re on that journey, and we continue to be on it. But I don\u2019t see that there\u2019s going to be step change relative to our previous expectations. We\u2019ve already exceeded them. There might be some more, but it\u2019s not a step change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly, just on credit quality, it feels like, obviously still meaningful reserve releases, so largely in consumer, but is there much left to go in terms of cards or commercial? Is that kind of inflecting, if you will, in terms of the degree of credit leverage that may still be there in terms of reserve release? How should we think about that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s start with commercial and say it\u2019s plus or minus zero at this point. So I think it\u2019s going to be [strong] for long, but that\u2019s not really going to be a reserve story for a little while. In the card business, we had been talking about potentially reached bottom for a period of time. We haven\u2019t yet, or it doesn\u2019t seem we have. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as we look into 2014, if things do continue to strengthen, it\u2019s possible there will be some more releases, but not at the levels that you saw in 2013, so in the first couple of quarters. And usually the first quarter is very instructive on that point. Usually that\u2019s when you see a material improvement, if there\u2019s going to be one, in terms of [unintelligible] rates. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the mortgage space, two things. We have $2.6 billion of NCI reserves left. We talked before about the fact that we think our more steady run rate number will be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. So there\u2019s another $1 billion or $1.5 billion to come in that space over the course of the next year or so, potentially. Obviously, environment allowing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the purchase credit impaired portfolios, we have $4.2 billion left after the two releases we just took. But remember that it\u2019s a life of loan portfolio. So something would have to change now in the environment, improve, for us to expect to take more releases. It\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t expect to be taking releases up to that $4.2 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last quarter you had some tax benefits. Did you have tax benefits this quarter? And can you quantify those?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, we did have some tax benefits this quarter. We had about $300 million after tax related to a number of items. State and local tax, some reserve releases. Not one particular thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what was the loan utilization rate for wholesale or commercial loans?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was just a little over 30%. So low thirties. No change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you said the number of branches shouldn\u2019t change a whole lot. If I recall, from an investor day, you had planned on opening a lot of new branches. I thought it was going to be a net increase. So is this a change in your expectations?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so we said, I think, at investor day, plus 100, plus or minus, in a year, when Gordon spoke earlier in 2013. We\u2019ve revisited based upon our assessment of customer preferences and activity and think we\u2019ve got to the footprint where we are happy at 5,600 plus or minus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at that back presentation, Gordon goes essentially through branches, branch size, technology, headcounts, and why.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so if you look at that, and then also obviously at investor day we\u2019ll go through it some more. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the more general question is, for your outlook you said that NII should be kind of flat, mortgage a little bit lower, and expenses only about flat or maybe lower from that $60 billion, after you eat that extra $1 billion. So it makes a difference how optimistic you are. If you\u2019re not optimistic, you might want to cut expenses more. And if you are optimistic, maybe you assume that fees are going to grow a lot more, because I know you were going to have positive operating leverage. So how do you see revenues growing faster than expenses? Is it the fees picking up? Is it expenses going lower? Or how do you get there? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a bit of both. Just one thing on mortgage, just a tiny clarification. We expect mortgage production to be broadly the same, as we\u2019ve seen in the second half, but we would expect to see continued improvement in the expense base in the servicing business. But having said all of that, it\u2019s a combination of relatively stable but potentially slightly higher NII. Yes, strength in fees on the basis of the strong driver growth that we talked about, and then our $60 billion or less of expenses. So we\u2019re working through all of the efficiency opportunities across the businesses, including in the retail space, to be able to deliver positive operating leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the way you should look at it too is each of our businesses is always trying to drive efficiency while investing. That doesn\u2019t change any particular year. That\u2019s kind of a nonstop kind of thing. And you see those efficiencies, because every business has pretty good margins after investing. And sometimes the revenue growth itself is either episodic or the timing isn\u2019t exactly the same as you invest. But if you see the drivers, which is deposits, investible assets, asset management, number of corporate clients, market shares, they\u2019re all pretty positive. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you just give us a general sense of your outlook for CIB? In the past you\u2019ve given us a little bit more detail, future expectations. How do you think 2014 is going to be for capital markets? What\u2019s your backlog like right now, and why did you lower VAR if your more optimistic?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, VAR itself as a calculation is based on a whole bunch of different things. We don\u2019t deliberately lower VAR. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With VAR, it really is just a feature of two things. If you look at our look back period for VAR, across asset classes, we\u2019re at very low levels of volatility. Just across all the asset classes. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving it. If volatility picks up, that could pick up. We\u2019re not driving that down. And it\u2019s also derisking in SVP. That is a little bit proactive, but it\u2019s obviously mostly done now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you stay with the volatility like it was 18 months ago, VAR itself would be like 60 or 70, just all on its own. So without changing your position. You know, the hardest business to get a handle on is CIB in terms of the short run. But what we see is investors still have to buy and sell securities. Corporations have ECM and DCM. And you can predict the rolloff, etc. The backlogs are pretty good. You saw a tremendous amount of IPOs in 2013. You saw a lot of debt financings. You\u2019ve already seen a bunch of M&amp;A earlier this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we don\u2019t budget or plan that you\u2019re going to have an unbelievable year in CIB. But if you ask me, the long term prospects are good. It\u2019s probably the business has to go through the most adjustments to the new regulatory environment, but the long term prospects are pretty good. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our margins are good, our returns are good. Our comp level is at 30%, down from 38% a couple of years ago, really reflecting higher capital, etc. But at that comp level, we can pay our people well, grow the franchise, grow around the world, serve our clients, and still get decent returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we feel very good about the business, and one of these days, it\u2019s going to boom. And you can guess just like I can guess when that might happen, but it will happen one day. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly, as it relates to Volcker, you said it should not hurt the results materially going ahead. In the past you said that it might hurt a billion dollars. That was a few years ago. And then another time you said it might even help. I know that was different management at the head then. But now you don\u2019t think it should impact things too much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Volcker, all things being equal, we would say not much. I think when we referred to the $1 billion or $2 billion, we were talking about regulations in general, including derivatives, [SES], clearing houses, and Volcker. And that number, we still kind of have in the back of our mind, but it\u2019s hard to tell what the effect of all those things are. The $1 billion to $2 billion I would say was probably in the conservative category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Mayo - CLSA </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And how much of that would be reflected already?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s the one that\u2019s hard to tell. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s very difficult to back [test], because these things are all interrelated. But it\u2019s not entirely possible to disentangle everything. But obviously we\u2019ve gone through some changes in 2013. Some of that will be reflected. But this is a number that we would expect to be reflected, to the degree that it is at all, over the course of the next two years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And remember, some of those things reduce capital requirements. Some people are making dramatic changes in their business models, which may free up market share for those of us that have additional market share. So it all remains to be seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that was also a static analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some things may reprice a little bit because of the capital liquidity requirements around them. So it all remains to be seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just had two quick follow up questions. The first is on the expectations for the expense base in CCB. If you take out that $400 million in legal expenses, you\u2019re looking at a run rate of $6.9 billion. As you think about where the tailwinds could be for expenses for this year, is it fair to assume that that $6.9 billion quarterly run rate could improve throughout the year this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would just reiterate what we previously said, which is if you look at servicing, and in particular the quarterly run rate, which is call it $600 million, in line with our expectations, that\u2019s going to continue to trend down towards $500 million by the end of this year in 2014. And then on the production side, while we obviously are going to see our expenses, to a degree, variable with the size of the market, we\u2019re continuing to also work on opportunities to make the fixed cost base more efficient. So hopefully we\u2019ll deliver some of that in 2014 too. And we\u2019ll do a more precise job of [unintelligible] around that at investor day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just a quick other follow up is a follow up to Guy\u2019s question on operational risk capital. You mentioned that there was a 50 basis point haircut due to litigation. Assuming that you\u2019re not going to have similar outsized litigation expense going forward, is that 50 basis point something that you can eventually recoup? And how long would that take?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s an excellent question. I would say, assuming we have no significant losses going forward, then we feel like we should be close to our high point, albeit there may be a little bit more in the first half of 2014. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just two comments on operational risk. The first is, unlike market and credit risk, although all of the parameters and the confidence levels are effectively the same, it doesn\u2019t naturally recalibrate itself to changes in the business environment, or to your business mix or model, if you structurally reduce risk. It\u2019s very backward-looking, and in that sense it differs because it doesn\u2019t recalibrate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so as a result, if you just let the models continue to predict, based on historical losses going forward, you would need to be carrying that elevated level of operational risk capital forward for a reasonably long time. It\u2019s a one in a thousand year horizon. So think about it in terms of five, ten years, not one or two years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so for that reason, we are very interested and working very hard with the industry to try and figure out how to better model changes in the business environment and to model and defend structural and permanent risk changes in our businesses in order to be able to recoup some of that more quickly. But at this point, I would characterize that as work that has not yet been done that is in progress, and so for the foreseeable future it will be elevated. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If we just add up some of the odds and ends of the businesses that you\u2019re getting out of for the niche products and the impact of Volcker, is it still a relatively modest amount in aggregate? I think last quarter you had said maybe a few hundred million of revenue give up from the businesses that you\u2019re tweaking. And I just wanted to know if that still holds, and if we overlay Volcker, kind of what the all-in number might be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so put Volcker to one side for a second. We didn\u2019t update, obviously, the list. We\u2019re going to do that at investor day. We thought about that for you. It\u2019s probably more important to think less about revenue but more about the impact on the bottom line given that some of these businesses may not have been returning [unintelligible], and may have been in investment phase and actually not be breaking even. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think it\u2019s safe to say that if you consider the impact on the bottom line more so than revenues, it\u2019s relatively modest, and we\u2019ll do work to update you on that. But remember it also is going to do two things, release capital, which will be a positive, and also improve the quality of the businesses and the control environment and the complexity, which will all be positive too. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just separately, as you think about kind of potential legal uncertainties or risk going forward, are there a couple that you kind of flag out there that are the ones that we should be watching most closely for the industry, for you guys, like whether it\u2019s LIBOR or FX? It feels like you\u2019ve obviously settled a lot on the mortgage side, a couple of the other big ones that were specific to you? What should we be watching to make sure we have a sense of what\u2019s going on? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The ones you all mentioned. We put them on our 10-K.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, it\u2019s the ones you mentioned. And if you look at our disclosures on the 10-Q, every quarter the items that we think raise themselves to levels of public disclosure are in that document. So look to last quarter and next quarter and you\u2019ll see. But we shouldn\u2019t comment specifically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And nothing maybe [unintelligible] coming out in the 10-K versus the third quarter Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t think so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, not at this point. But obviously the K is a few weeks away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On that question about the operational risk capital, isn\u2019t it kind of double or triple counting against you when you\u2019ve got an $8 billion reserve, which actually reduces your capital, and is it fair to say you don\u2019t get credit for that $8 billion in your capital base when you think about that operational risk capital?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you think about the basis for capital and put aside whether you like the way it works in a modeled environment, your reserves are for your expected losses, and your capital is for your unexpected losses. So in theory you shouldn\u2019t get explicit credit for them. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the bigger point for us is if you look at the sorts of things that are driving our capital levels to be as elevated as they are, they are things, for example, like the PLMBS issues, and also certain of the very large mortgage, DOJ, international mortgage settlement, ISFR, [unintelligible] issues. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s our belief that this firm is not exposed today, or will not be exposed going forward, to those levels of risk at anywhere near that scale going forward. But as I said, we have no ability at this point to scale those back, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re very focused on. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s less really about whether we\u2019re getting credit for our reserves, and a little bit more about how we try, in the industry, to evolve the framework in partnership with the regulators and defend over time that there are structural risk reductions that mean those risks are no longer present in that sale. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. So in the short run, the fact that you settled actually increases the operational risk, but you hope that over the longer term it will decrease it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You had made a brief comment about the equities results, about the comparable periods being higher. Were there any other reasons that equity trading results were kind of down as much as they were?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not specifically. We did fairly well in cash, but our cash platform is not as mature as some others. So I think we would characterize the performance as good, but coming off of, as I said, a very strong quarter for equity derivatives in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then any other areas - Gordon Smith has presented a few times and talked about kind of derisking some of his businesses - that we should be looking at for sales?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On page 15, I think, last quarter we showed you a bunch of things that we were working on. We didn\u2019t replace the page, because it\u2019s not meaningfully changed. That\u2019s not to say that at the margins we don\u2019t continue to look at our businesses in terms of simplification and derisking. So I would say that while there may be things at the margin that we will explore over time, then there\u2019s nothing structurally big that you should be aware of. And again, we\u2019ll do some more of that for you at investor day. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You mentioned that your utilization rate in the commercial area is in the low 30% range presently. You also pointed out that you\u2019re optimistic about the U.S. economy for this year being stronger, and then the positive impact it will have on loan demand. What do you think the utilization rate could get to by year-end?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to do just middle market, because that\u2019s the one that\u2019s kind of at a 30%. Years ago, it used to average a little more like 45%. It looks like, to us, that what you have is they have a lot more deposits, and a lot less utilization. And so obviously they\u2019re going to use some of their own money before they borrow against a revolver or something like that. And one day, you would expect it to go up. We\u2019re not guessing it\u2019s going to happen in 2014. But I would say we\u2019ll be sitting here one day, when we\u2019ve had a very strong economy, it will be 10 points higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good. And then on the commercial real estate, as you guys pointed out, you\u2019re having real good success in this area. What geographic regions of the country are you seeing the best success? And then second, what product types are you finding are working the best in growing that book?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, multifamily is a big portion of that. I would say the major cities is pretty much where you\u2019d say it, son it\u2019s hard to answer specifically. I think both the multifamily, and other than real estate loans, it\u2019s really the big cities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You also mentioned that you guys have about $350 billion on deposit at the Fed. If the Fed decides to eliminate the interest they pay on those deposits to all the banks, would that change your strategy of keeping that amount up at the Fed?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I mean, you know, change either that, or how you reimburse clients for deposits, and obviously it will go into how you price and run your business. We\u2019re not expecting that to happen, but obviously we would do that. And you have other alternatives. You might invest some of that money elsewhere. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it\u2019s also important to point out that a large portion of that $350 billion are deposits or cash that we would consider to be client nonoperational deposits. And as a result, we don\u2019t give ourselves any liquidity value for those. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting the [unintelligible] at the Fed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I may have missed this, but in the card merchant and services auto business, the noninterest expenses for the fourth quarter jumped up to $2.2 billion from the prior quarter\u2019s $1.9 billion. They\u2019ve been flat for the prior three quarters. Any particular reason why there was a jump?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mostly marketing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, it\u2019s predominantly marketing. And with respect to marketing, it can be lumpy quarter to quarter. So it\u2019s not an unexpected number for us. It\u2019s just higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We feel like we\u2019ve been doing a good job at card acquisition of high quality cards. You see that number, but it\u2019s up quite a bit. So we have some good, active programs out there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It looked like in the quarter that you guys bought back about $300 million worth of your stock in this quarter. And since the last CCAR, it\u2019s just over $2.2 billion. If I recall, you have an approval for $6 billion. Is it fair to assume that you\u2019ll use the next quarter to fill out the rest of that $6 billion? Or is that too optimistic?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Way optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I think that would be optimistic. Obviously we\u2019ll determine the first quarter, as we go through it, we\u2019ll have our [unintelligible]. That\u2019s certainly our expectation, and there may be some more, but I don\u2019t think you should expect us to catch up completely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remember, we want to meet our own objective, the 9.5% or 10%, and obviously the litigation costs hurt our ability to do a little bit of that, so we caught up on that. And also, the stock price is a lot higher than it was when we talked about the best way to buy back some stock. So we always look at that as the important thing. We don\u2019t just buy back stock regardless of price. Not that we think it\u2019s a bad price, but when it was at $33 a share or whatever, that was an extraordinarily compelling price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gerard Cassidy - RBC </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You also gave us a little bit of guidance of what we should expect for this year\u2019s CCAR, maybe similar to what you did last year. Should we look at it as what you were approved for, or what you actually executed in the repurchases of better guide numbers, since they are quite a bit different?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The board will decide when the time comes, when they look at all the priorities, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would just reiterate what I said before, which is getting to our target ratios is a priority, but it\u2019s not the only one. We\u2019ll have to see how things play out in 2014. But if you do the math, then you can take your own estimates of what you think we\u2019ll earn next year. We should be able to also have the opportunity to take it to buy more than just [unintelligible], so we want that flexibility. That\u2019s what we [submitted] for, and we\u2019ll obviously manage through each quarter as we see it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it may depend on what we sell, how much we can mitigate, what the final rules are and stuff. So there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Derek De Vries of UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just had a few housekeeping questions left. I think you mentioned the mark-to-market gain in asset management revenues? I\u2019m wondering if you can just quantify that so we can figure that out for our forecast? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s just a little less than $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Derek De Vries - UBS </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the investment bank, on the comp to income ratio, that\u2019s clearly at the right end of your guidance. I\u2019m just wondering, has there been any change in the deferred versus expense this year? And then related, do we enter 2014 with a similar amount of awarded not yet expensed?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s no change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to follow up on the loan growth expectations. If we adjust for the typical seasonality associated with the credit card loans, which obviously is high in the fourth quarter, it looks like your core growth rate in loans was something like 60 or 70 basis points sequentially, which would obviously translate into roughly a 2.5% annual growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Are you talking about total and core? Or are you talking about reported and card?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m talking about reported. So it just seems like the 2.5% seems like a fairly robust figure, so I just want to get your view about what the run rate of core loan growth might be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to try and answer the question, and tell me if I don\u2019t. If you look at our actual total loans for the whole firm year over year, our growth reported was 0.6%, so call it just shy of 1%. But underlying that, the core loan growth was about 4%. So I think that as we look forward, we expect core growth to continue at or stronger than those levels. We\u2019ve reached, as we say in card, the point where, seasonality aside, that inflection point where we should expect net modest growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as I said, we\u2019re going to have to all wait and see how client demand plays out in small business in the middle market space, but we are hoping that at the second half of 2014, when the confidence in the economic recovery, we have confidence that when others join us, they will actually start to borrow and spend. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it sounds like, continuing along this trajectory, with potential strength in the back half of next year? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, that\u2019s our hope.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that back to the NII dollar expectations, which seem fairly flat. But if the loan growth continues fairly strong, and the expectation is to continue to play capital into securities opportunistically, and the CIO portfolio is approaching breakeven, why is the expectation not for a stronger net interest income dollar growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Because we talked earlier about the fact that we\u2019ve been seeing, and we expect to continue to see, some spread compression in loans that, at this point, in the near term - and we didn\u2019t talk about the whole year for 2014, but in the near term - we\u2019re expecting the improvement that we would see as a result of higher yields on investment securities, etc., to be largely offset by the compression in loan growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just two final followups. On the commitment side, as you talked about adjusting the trade book, and as we see the commitments continue to come down, how aggressively are you focusing on the commitment side from here in terms of balancing the long term growth potential versus the risk weightings and capital build?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The way to look at that is that what drives the company is serving clients, and so we don\u2019t target, you know, just when we get rid of commitments or something like that. But obviously we\u2019ve asked all the people and businesses to start to optimize a little bit commitments, balance sheet, LCR, SLR, Basel III. And so you\u2019ll probably see a little bit of a squeeze in commitments as they do that. But not at the expense of trying to do a good job for clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other thing that I should point out is some of those commitments are much more capital or liquidity hogs than others. So that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see a little bit more of the squeeze. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Usdin - Jefferies &amp; Company </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just one follow up on the fixed income side within that comment earlier about the runoff businesses. Is there a way you can update how we should think about the potential sale of physical commodities and what proportion it is of the $15.5 billion of FIC revenues this year, and Marianne, to your point about how that is in a relative profitable sense? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s talk about last year. If you look at 2013 reported, you would have seen that our commodities revenues counted for in the low teens of our markets revenues, but that\u2019s on an accounting basis. So that\u2019s just a revenue [chore] only. So if you think about the economic revenue, because obviously there\u2019s some accounting growth [unintelligible], much smaller number than that. So call it mid single digit, mid to 6-7%. But then it was a business that was in a combination of being built out, so it wasn\u2019t fully mature. And also, we\u2019re selling parts of the business that are highly [unintelligible] intensive to us. So think about the impact on the bottom line as being considerably more modest and with some capital benefits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to talk a little bit about your mortgage origination platform. It looks like you dropped from about $40 billion to about $23 billion, and your overall market dropped like 25%, and that\u2019s like a 40% drop, which drops probably your market share to low 8%. Can you add some color to that? Is that just mainly a function of the refis going away? Should we see an increase in market share down the road?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of things. First of all, if you just take the second half versus the first half, we said that we thought that the overall market would be down 30% to 40%. It was down about 33%. So it was in line with our expectations. And our performance was in line with that too. So you\u2019ve got to remember that the revenue versus loan volume, and how that gets recognized, is some timing differences. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to market share, if you look backwards into \u201913, the overall size of the market was revised up, which means that our market share was, all other things being equal, just relatively revised down, doesn\u2019t change anything. But going forward, our market share will be a factor of obviously the size of the market, but also our pricing discipline to make sure that we want to get an appropriate risk adjusted return. So we would gain share, but only if we can do it getting paid for the risk and the cost of servicing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the whole reduction was refi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the whole reduction was refi. I should say that, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I know you don\u2019t want to make any comments about political figures, but now that we\u2019ve got Mel Watt coming to town, there\u2019s probably going to be more focus on extending the credit box than we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, where most companies don\u2019t want to really get away from high FICO, high credit quality product. Do you think that Watt can be successful in opening the credit curve? And what type of things would you want to hear where you would start extending the credit box?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that people in the business have been slowly extending the credit box. I\u2019m talking about over the last 18 months. If you look at LCVs, if you go to different cities. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to see a dramatic expansion of the credit box, because all the rep and warranty, all the litigation and stuff like that, for anything that\u2019s not qualified mortgages. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the qualified mortgages, you know, credit is available. GSE is 90% LTV. On the Ginnie Mae side, you know, close to 100% LTV. So there\u2019s credit availability, you just have to have the ability to pay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And FHA will set its own policy, but even there I think people are going to have a much tighter underwriting than the FHA guidelines, because of how much FHAs cost people.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first one, really I suppose, goes back to Sunday and the news that came out [Basel]. For the last 16 quarters, we\u2019ve been talking about regulation and you\u2019ve often been quite aggressive in talking about the impact of some of that regulation. But it seems like we\u2019ve reached a tipping point on Sunday, whereby we\u2019ve set back from those rules that were suggested in June and came out with something that was sensible, but actually also was going to support the growth of your business, and indeed the growth of the economy. Do you think we\u2019re actually at the stage now where we can actually feel that we\u2019ve got over the worst of the regulation and we can now actually get on with running our and your businesses?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we know for the most part the contours of the regulation at this point. Some of the fine tuning still needs to be done. So I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of banks globally adjusting to the new financial architecture. And the effect of that will be different in different parts of the world. It\u2019s slightly different for certain products, but it will probably be okay in total. It\u2019s nice to have the rules, to live with them, and now we\u2019ve got to push them down and understand them in a little more detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s still a few things we\u2019re waiting for. I mean, long term debt requirements, something to look out for in the first quarter. But having more clarity is definitely helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re seeing some people make bigger strategic changes, some are making just small tactical changes. And then we\u2019re going to report a lot more what we think the effect of all this is at investor day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Christopher Wheeler - Mediobanca </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the second question really relates down to the mix of your investment banking revenues. Clearly what we\u2019ve seen is obviously the downward pressure on fixed income for some time now, for a whole bunch of reasons, some of which you\u2019ve touched on. But I suppose what a lot of people are talking about is that fixed income will no longer be quite the dominant part of the revenue pool for big investment banks, as it was. But in your case, and one or two other people, obviously it\u2019s very important business. Is your view, and perhaps don\u2019t just talk about yourself, but the really big players, the very successful players in fixed income, would actually probably be seeking to take share in what is going to be a smaller pot going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I look at it a little bit different. I look at it like the pot will change and adjust to the new world, but from there it will probably grow. Because if you look at underlying numbers, the amount of investable assets around the world is going to double over 10 years, the amount of needs of corporations and sovereigns and supernationals, and ECM/DCM advice will double over 10 years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So there will be a strong underlying business. Spreads, products, those things have always changed. Spreads have been coming down my whole life, and yet we have a healthy business. So we expect that fixed income, after some adjustment, will be a good business. We think a lot of these trends are cyclical, not secular, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re positioned for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is possible that, if people leave, and certain things reprice\u2026 All businesses have to have a normal return on capital for the average player, otherwise they wouldn\u2019t exist. So we do think you\u2019ll see some of that. There will be pieces at the [unintelligible] banks, which is fine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had a couple of questions regarding the Basel SLR. Specifically, Marianne, I wanted to clarify a comment you had made earlier, where it sounded as though you expect the U.S. regulators to adopt the revised Basel framework from over the weekend as a final SLR calculation approach. And I didn\u2019t know if that guidance was in the context of the higher 5% SLR requirement, which is being imposed on the U.S. [unintelligible].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The reality is, I don\u2019t know any more than you do. I just think that given the changes that were made, it seemed to be positive and constructive. There\u2019s reason to believe that the U.S. regulators would want to leverage that. I could be wrong. And obviously we did comment letters on the U.S. NPR, but I\u2019m not aware of any specifics on the [quotient].</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d just add that if you listen to what the regulators said, not this time but going back, they intended to make Basel and U.S. rules common. About the rules. They did not say they intended to have the same percent. So we\u2019re just assuming the 5% is going to [stay]. And we think there will be a couple of other adjustments going forward too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just looking at both the risk based and leverage based ratios, it sounds as though for the SLR there are a lot of mitigation opportunities at your disposal. On a pro forma basis, which ratio do you anticipate will represent the binding constraint on capital return going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at the total firm consolidated, then they actually [unintelligible] this quite nicely, if you think about our target for Basel tier one common at 10% or 10.5% and a leverage target of 5% or 5.5%. So I think the leverage ratio feels like, as a consolidated matter, it\u2019s a simple fact [unintelligible] as it\u2019s supposed to be, not a binding constraint. The devil\u2019s in the details. As you push that down, as I said, to the individual business and product, and then obviously consider it in a context of the whole client relationship. I think as we look forward, CCAR is something to be thoughtful about, because it\u2019s a stress scenario, it\u2019s evolving in terms of the maturity of it, as well as a move over time towards being on a Basel III advanced approach. So if I had to guess, I would say CCAR could be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Steven Chubak - Nomura </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then transitioning to a risk-based ratio that\u2019s maybe not spoken about as often, the tier one capital ratio, that ultimately could compel increased preferred issuance. We did see you tap the market within the first six months of the year, and I didn\u2019t know how we should be thinking about the level of preferred issuance you\u2019re targeting going forward. Is it consistent with the 150 basis points noted within the Fed\u2019s proposal? Or should we be thinking about that differently, i.e. some of the mandated buffer will be met with incremental equity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that our tier one capital needs to be at 11% plus. We said we were going to run at about 10% to 10.5% Basel III tier one common. I would suggest that the gap will be [unintelligible] and maybe more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are no further questions at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marianne Lake </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jamie Dimon</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, talk to you in a quarter. </p>", "twitContent": "$JPM - JPMorgan Chase CEO Discusses Q4 2013 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944961-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-discusses-q4-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "907", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17862", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17876", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/1944961-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-discusses-q4-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/1944961-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-discusses-q4-2013-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
