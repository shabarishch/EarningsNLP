Fiscal 2019 was another record year for our business, as we achieved the highest sales in company history. Excluding the extra week in 2018, fiscal 2019 sales grew 3.5% to $110.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $10.25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As expected, we finished the year with our strongest comp performance in the fourth quarter. Comp sales were up 5.2% from last year and our U.S. comps were positive 5.3%. Sales for the fourth quarter were $25.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.28.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw broad based growth across all geographies and merchandising departments in the quarter. All 19 of our U.S. regions posted positive comps and internationally both Canada and Mexico reported positive comps in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Ted will detail, both comp ticket and transactions grew in the core and we saw growth with both our Pro and DIY customers. We have strong holiday season with record setting sales on Black Friday and during Cyber Week. These results reflect solid execution by our stores, our merchants, our supply chain teams, as well as our vendor partners and demonstrate the overall health of the consumer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am proud of our results in fiscal 2019 is the team successfully navigated a number of external headwinds by maintaining a relentless focus on our customer. 2019 was also a pivotal year in our transformation to create the One Home Depot experience. We are now two years into our multiyear investment and are realizing benefits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have more conviction than ever that these strategic initiatives are creating a value proposition that is unique to the marketplace and will extend our leadership position for years to come. The majority of our U.S. stores have a new look and feel, and we address customer pinpoints around navigation and checkout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our enhanced signage and store refresh package, along with investments in the front-end of our stores have improved the customer experience and driven associate productivity. These store investments are driving higher customer satisfaction scores, which we believe is translating into market share gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a compliment to our store investments, we\u2019re investing to strengthen the competitive advantages that we have built through the blending of our physical and digital platforms into a more seamless interconnected experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, our chain wide rollout of digital appliance labels connecting ratings from the digital world to the physical world, enhancing the in-store shopping experience. Additionally, homedepot.com continues to be an engine for growth for our overall business, driving increased traffic online and additional footsteps to our stores, because of this, we continue to invest in search functionality, category presentations, product content and enhance fulfillment options to remove friction from the online shopping experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding the extra week last year, online sales grew 20.8% in the quarter, and 21.4% for the year, and over 50% of the time, our customers choose to pick up their order in a store. This is the power of the interconnected retail strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve also expanded our digital capabilities by investing in B2B website experience tailored specifically for the needs of our Pro customers. We have now onboarded over 1 million Pro customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, during the quarter, we completed the integration of our third party best-in-class CRM system for all of our Pro sales and services teams. This enhances our visibility, enabling us to better serve our customers. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to build capabilities to engage with a Pro, no matter when, where or how they want to interact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another key component of the best-in-class interconnected shopping experience centers on enhanced delivery and fulfillment options. In 2019, we continued our multiyear journey to create the fastest, most efficient delivery network in home improvement. We are now live with at least one of each type of facility that we\u2019re building. So it is early days, we\u2019re pleased with the initial results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, we have opened a dozen Market Delivery Operations or MDOs that have enabled us to transition 20% of our clients\u2019 deliveries from an outsourced model to one in which we control more of the customer experience. This is translated to meaningful improvements in our customer satisfaction scores for appliance deliveries. Our supply chain build-out will continue to ramp from here with the largest number of new facilities coming online in 2021 and 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to 2020, Richard will take you to the details, but we expect another year of growth, with both sales and top growth ranging from approximately 3.5% to 4%, and diluted earnings per share of approximately $10.45.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, our Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share. We remain committed to maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation to create value for our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m incredibly proud of the progress our teams made as we transform ourselves into the One Home Depot the future. While we define our sales growth in percentage terms, we capture share in dollar terms and to the second year of One Home Depot investment program, we have grown sales by over $9 billion, the level of growth unmatched in our market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look forward to 2020, I am more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead. We\u2019re investing to unlock the power of a truly interconnected customer experience by enhancing our already strong foundation to further extend our leadership position into the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As with any transformation, the work we\u2019re doing is complex and I\u2019m proud of the way our associates continue to execute at higher levels and focus on what\u2019s most important in our business, our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to close by thanking our associates for the hard work and dedication in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. For the second half of the year, 100% of our stores will receive success sharing, our bonus program for our associates. We look forward to continuing our momentum in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, let me turn the call over to Ted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ted Decker</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Craig. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong finish to the year with fourth quarter sales exceeding our expectations. We saw growth across historical Pro and DIY customers. All of our merchandising departments posted positive comps, but by our clients department, which posted double-digit comps in the quarter, constant decor and storage and tools were also above the company average. All other merchandising departments were positive but below the company top of 5.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, comp average ticket increased 4.4% and comps transactions increased 0.8%. The strength in our comp was partially driven by a shift in our event timing, which Richard will talk through in a moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we had an excellent response to our Black Friday and Holiday events and our customers continue to trade up to new and innovative items. After experiencing significant deflation in lumber and copper during the first three quarters of 2019, commodity prices had a more neutral impact in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the fourth quarter, big ticket concurrence actions those over $1,000, which represent approximately 20% of US sales were up double digits. The strength in our big ticket sales was driven in part by the shift in our event timing, as well as strong performance in number of other big ticket categories. During the fourth quarter big ticket categories like appliances, vinyl plank flooring, and our installation services business all posted costs above the company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consumer demand is strong and this was evident during our annual Black Friday gift centre and decorative holiday events. The partnership and collaboration between our merchants and supplier partners help bring a fantastic lineup of great deals in special box categories like smartphone power tools, hand tools and decorative holiday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our unique assortment, together with excellent customer service and execution led to incredible results. Black Friday was a record sales day for our company and our gift centre event grew double digits versus last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also saw our customers tackle a variety of projects around the house. During the fourth quarter we saw comps above the company average in several kitchen and bath categories, special or window coverings, cleaning and exterior paint. We also saw significant growth in our online only home decor categories, which we call HD Home as we build awareness from these high quality style forward assortments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sales for our Pro customers were healthy, driven by strength and categories like pneumatics, concrete, hand tools, and COGS all of which grew faster than the company average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking back at 2019, our team continued their unwavering commitment to serve our customers with great everyday values and innovative product and we did this while investing in a customer back store interconnected experience to ensure that we continue to be the product authority and home improvement for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At our Investors Conference back in December, we talked about investments we were making across our business. We also shared our new ad campaign and tagline, How Doers Get More Done that we launched to highlight our investments into these new experiences and capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe that it\u2019s important to signal to our customers that the Home Depot is evolving as their needs change. But it\u2019s still early in our campaign, we see customers responding to our enhanced capabilities, giving us credit for saving them time and helping them complete their projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In response to our campaign, we saw one of our largest single days of downloads of our award winning mobile app and double-digit growth in usage of mobile tools like product locator and image search.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look forward to 2020, we will continue our investments to better meet our customers\u2019 needs and drive a great shopping experience. One of the investments you\u2019ll see in the first half of the year is a reset to our outdoor power equipment base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We know the marketplace for outdoor power tools is transitioned to cordless technology and we\u2019ve learned in our tools department that once a customer adopts a battery platform, they see tremendous value in sticking with that platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similar to what we\u2019ve done in our tools department, we\u2019re in the process of resetting our outdoor powerful equipment phase to showcase our assortment by brand highlighting EGO, Toro, Milwaukee, Ryobi, Dewalt and Makita, many of which can only be found at the Home Depot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To this new presentation, customers can clearly see and easily shop the value proposition that these cordless platforms bring including being more environmentally friendly, safer and easier to use, all with the power and runtime to get the job done. These powerful brands now have the lion\u2019s share of batteries in the marketplace with hundreds of millions of batteries and customers homes and job sites today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We currently offer over 1000 cordless power tools, and that number will continue to grow as our supplier partners are introducing innovative product all the time. Our comprehensive and unique assortment of outdoor power equipment resulted in double-digit comps in fiscal 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The spring right around the corner, we are gearing up for another busy season. Our stores are stocked with new and innovative products and we just recently announced we are hiring 80,000 new associates to help us serve our customers during our spring selling season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Richard</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Richard McPhail</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin, let me take a quick moment to remind everyone that fiscal 2019 consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal \u201818 consisted of 53 weeks. This extra week added approximately $1.7 billion in sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. When we report our comparable sales or comps, we report them on a 52-week to 52-week basis by comparing weeks one-week through 52-week of fiscal 2019, with weeks two through 53 weeks of fiscal 2018</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter of 2019, total sales were $25.8 billion, a 2.7% decrease from last year, reflecting the compared against the extra week in 2018. Our total company comp sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.2% and comps in the U.S. increased 5.3%. Because of last year\u2019s 53rd week and the resulting calendar shift, our monthly comps are distorted due to the timing of our annual Black Friday and Cyber Monday events this year versus last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our reported monthly comps for the total company were positive 1.2% in November, 9.9% in December and 5.7% in January. Our monthly comps in the U.S. were positive 1.1% in November, 10.4% in December and 5.8% in January.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given the distortion in our monthly comps caused by the calendar shift, we believe that it is more appropriate to look at November and December on a combined basis. For the combined two months of November and December, our total company comp was 5% followed by 5.7% in January.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, our sales total record $110.2 billion. If we exclude the sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2018, we grew sales by approximately $3.7 billion in fiscal 2019, a level of growth unmatched in our market. For the year, total company comp sales increased 3.5% and U.S. comp sales increased 3.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points from last year. Similar to last quarter, the change in our gross margin was primarily driven by higher shrink and a mix of products sold compared to last year. For the year, our gross margin was 34.1% slightly higher than our guidance at the beginning of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter operating expense as a percent sales decreased by 64 basis points to 20.7%, slightly better than our plan. During the quarter, we saw approximately 77 basis points of leverage, as we lapped the fiscal 2018 impairment of certain trade names and the 53rd week last year. This leverage was partially offset by expenses related to our strategic investment plan of approximately $280 million, which increased approximately $25 million from last year and cost 12 basis points of the average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fiscal 2019 operating expense as a percent of sales was 19.7%, a decrease of 28 basis points from last year. Our fiscal 2019 expense performance was better than our initial expectations, driven by productivity initiatives in our core business. During the year, we spent approximately $1 billion of investment expenses related to our strategic initiatives in line with our plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our operating margin for the fourth quarter was approximately 13.2% and for the year was approximately 14.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Interest and other expenses for the fourth quarter grew by $27 million to $292 million due primarily the higher long-term debt levels than one year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 20.3% and from fiscal 2019 was 23.6%. The lower than expected effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2019, was driven primarily by several discrete tax items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $2.28, an increase of 9.1% from last year. For fiscal 2019, diluted earnings per share were $10.25, an increase of 5.3% compared to fiscal 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to some additional highlights, we ended the year with a store count of 2291, while retail selling square footage was approximately 238 million square feet. For the fiscal year, total sales per retail square foot were $455, the highest in our company\u2019s history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the end of the quarter, merchandise inventories grew $606 million to $14.5 billion and inventory terms were 4.9 times, down slightly versus last year. The growth in our inventory versus last year reflects the investments we\u2019re making to accelerate merchandising resets and higher in stock levels than we had one year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to capital allocation. In fiscal 2019, we generated approximately $13.7 billion of cash from operations and use that cash, as well as the proceeds from $2.4 billion of net debt issuances to invest in our business, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase our shares. During the year, we invested approximately $2.7 billion back into the business through capital expenditures. Further, we paid $6 billion in dividends to our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, during the year, we repurchased approximately $7 billion or about 32.8 million of our outstanding shares, including roughly $3.25 billion or 14.5 million shares in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Completed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing 12 months, return on invested capital was approximately 45.4%, 60 basis points higher than the end of fiscal 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today\u2019s press release includes our guidance for fiscal 2020 and I want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we got off of GAAP, so fiscal 2012 guidance will watch from our reported results for fiscal 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At our Investor Conference in December of 2019, we shared with you some preliminary thoughts for 2020 and we\u2019re reiterating that guidance today. The economy is strong and the U.S. consumer is healthy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The foundation of our sales plan starts with GDP and our 2020 sales guidance as soon as U.S. GDP growth of slightly less than 2% in 2020. The GDP, we add the impact that we think we will see from the housing environment, including demand driven by home price appreciation, housing turnover, household formation and the age of the housing stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look at these metrics, we see an environment that is healthy and stable. Our 2020 self guidance also assumes that we will continue to gain share in the marketplace. For fiscal 2020, we expect both sales growth and total company costs sales growth of approximately 3.5% to 4%. Fiscal 2020 represents the peak year of our investment program, and as a result, we expect our fiscal 2020 operating expenses to grow at 1.2 times the rate of our expected sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, we expect to grow operating profit dollars to $16 billion, giving us an operating margin of approximately 14%. For fiscal 2020, we assume our effective tax rate will be approximately 24%. We expect fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 2% to $10.45.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, we project cash flow from operations of approximately $13.5 billion. We plan to invest $2.8 billion of this cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. We also plan to use this cash to pay $6.4 billion in dividends and repurchase at least $5 billion of outstanding shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I close, I would like to update you on how we\u2019re thinking about one of our capital allocation principles. With regards to our dividends in lieu of using a 55% payout ratio, we will look to grow our dividends every year as we grow earnings as we have for the last 11 years. This morning, we announced that our Board increased our quarterly dividend by 10%, which equates to an annual dividend of $6 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I want to thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. And Christine, we are now ready for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. It\u2019s on any\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. It\u2019s on any potential supply disruption coming out of Asia. What have you factored in? What\u2019s the current status of your supply chain? Have you seen any issues with getting product from Asia at this point? And if this extends for a meaningful period of time, what -- how do you size the potential impact to your sales and earnings over the next few quarters?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Michael, let me -- I\u2019ll start off and then I\u2019ll hand it over to Mark Holifield. First of all, the guidance that we\u2019ve provided, obviously, does not include any guidance update for the situation. It\u2019s a very fluid situation that we\u2019re monitoring closely. And all of our goods for Q1 are essentially onshore or on their way. So we feel pretty good about that situation. And Mark, do you might want to provide an update on...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Holifield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Sure, Craig. Yeah. As you mentioned, it does change every day. Our Q1 merchandise is already here or on the way and Q2 the picture is still developing there. For our direct import, our sourcing offices in Asia are in touch with our top factories as they are returning to operations. For our domestic vendors, we\u2019re working with them to understand and mitigate any potential impacts in their supply chains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our teams working with all of our suppliers, both domestic and import, and our logistics service providers on a PO-by-PO, container by container basis to understand what the impacts of our product flow are and they\u2019re taking appropriate action. We are encouraged that we\u2019re seeing factories come back to work.

Thanks. My follow question is you just wrapped up your second year in a row with about 1% growth comp growth in traffic after many years of higher traffic than that. Is 1% growth in traffic the new norm and how do you think the implementation of your strategic investment plan is going to impact traffic in the next few years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The objective of what we\u2019re doing on the investments plan is to position ourselves to be able to continue to grow faster than the market. I think, some of the growth that we saw in years past was a result of an accelerated recovery from a very difficult spot. What we\u2019ve always focused on is how do we balance ticket and transactions, and that\u2019s really where our focus is and the market will determine what level is that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Lasser</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you very much, and good luck.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, guys. I actually had a follow-up on Michael\u2019s question first, like, I guess, the question is, given the delta that we\u2019ve seen in transactions and average ticket. What would you guys point to regarding kind of what\u2019s driving that divergence, I mean, and you just referenced you had a recovery phase, but I would think that recovery phase actually would, help both sides of that ledger, not just one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, I\u2019d say we have some opportunity areas that we\u2019ve invested in to continue to grow that is accelerated our ticket growth largely being we put significant investment in appliances, that has paid back in a in a very big way in terms of the accelerated growth we\u2019ve seen in that business. Same thing would hold true for what Ted referenced as it relates to the lithium technology and the average ticket growth, we\u2019ve seen power tools and now in outdoor power equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think there is some innovation and investment factors that have helped drive ticket maybe even above and beyond as we took share in those categories. But we look pretty pleased with the consistency of our traffic growth over time. And like, I said, we\u2019ll work to balance traffic and ticket we always want to make sure there\u2019s a reasonable balance there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when you think about -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was just going to add, Scott, I\u2019ll add to that Q4, very much event driven or gift center, decorative holiday, and as Craig said, appliances and those all performed incredibly well. So that contributes to the ticket and as we see consumers continue to trade up to the new innovative product that we\u2019re offering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And while we\u2019re happy with transactions, they were a little bit depressed with the lack of cold weather. So if you think during a winter you get a lot of people stopping in for ice melt for that that smaller pickup even car washer fluid, et cetera, and with the more mild winter a lot of the biggest suppression there of transactions were those quick cold weather pick up items?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess when you think about all the investments you guys have been making in the business and supply chain technology, should we continue expect kind of the pattern that we\u2019ve seen here continue or is it have a more balanced impact as we go forward? Thanks</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I think, again, we look for kind of balance in that will be perfect one way or another no, but we would look for balance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scot Ciccarelli</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Long-term question first, so thinking again about the payback from investments, it sounds like we\u2019ll see some costs moderate next year, so that\u2019ll be good to margin. But in terms of the topline lift and I realize you\u2019re probably not going to quantify much. But can you tell us where the places will start to see better comps? Is it the Pro-wallet share, is it MRO categories, DIY? So what are the -- some of the KPIs that won\u2019t be as apparent as comps that you\u2019re seeing that that tells you that some of these investments are beginning to pay off?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all, our investments are targeted for all the above that you just rolled out, probably, we think MRO you think consumer, our intent is to grow in all of those spaces. And but what we\u2019re really trying to set ourselves up to do in the investment is to be able to position Home Depot to grow faster than the market growth on a consistent basis no matter what that environment is. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to get done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And does that require waiting for the supply chain investment to finish rolling out or no that should stagger as all these other investments are taking place?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, the supply chain is a part of the overall component. As we\u2019ve shared with you, we have investments that span across our business, whether that\u2019s an investment in the store, whether that\u2019s investments in the digital world, in our marketing elements and our product development, as well as the supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll see the -- as we put more and more of these capabilities in place as a supply chain continues to expand. As we open more facilities in \u201821 and \u201822, the bulk of those we\u2019ll see that continue to grow as you put more capabilities against market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then my follow up is in the fourth quarter, it looks like the business performed a little better than planned. Can you parse out underlying housing, signs and it may be improving versus some of the seasonal, it sounds like December was a big month, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s more holiday, but at the same time, you didn\u2019t have as much weather impact. So if you can just talk about underlying housing versus other drivers?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Simeon, this is Richard. So from a housing perspective, all housing indicators wind up really sort of where we expected them. And so we don\u2019t think that that had any material impact on our business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You mentioned December, there\u2019s a little bit of a timing shift there in the calendar from November to December. But, overall, it was really the strong execution across the quarter and Ted maybe you want to go a little bit more into the strength of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I think, as I said in my comments, we like the balance of ticket and transaction, we certainly like the balance of consumer in Pro and our Pro was strong in Q4, but we really saw the engaged consumer in -- whether more discretionary categories and terrific artificial Christmas tree business, our gift center record sales and growth and our gift center and appliances, as I said, double-digit comps in appliances, it\u2019s not always just a refrigerator that\u2019s broken being replaced, it\u2019s increasingly discretionary purchases. So we just saw a very strong consumer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Simeon Gutman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chuck Grom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Thanks. Nice quarter. And normalizing for the event shifts sales are pretty consistent across the quarter. I\u2019m just wondering how we think about the cadence of comps by quarter in 2020 and I\u2019m wondering if you could offer some thoughts on how February started out?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, thank you, Chuck. So we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but we would say that 2020 we will see are relatively evenly spread across the two half of the year with respect to the comp sales. And with respect to what we\u2019ve seen so far in 2020, our guidance is based on the best information we have of the moment and so our results today are consistent with that guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chuck Grom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great. And then just bigger picture is one of you guys could just amplify on the opportunity that you have with the Pro, as you onboard more of them onto the B2B website, particularly now that there\u2019s going to be the CRM aspect included? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I think when we think about the Pro customer, we\u2019re actually building an ecosystem for our Pro customer that encompasses product and brands and delivery and credit services and our digital capabilities would B2B tool rental and a whole lot more. Obviously, all of that coming together allows us to be able to service our Pro customers in a more holistic way and it allows us to continue to grow with larger more complex customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, when we look at the Pro business and we think we\u2019re in 15% to 17% range, and we\u2019d love to see that the much more in line with consumer penetration of share that we have as we go forward, which is why we\u2019re making these investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chuck Grom</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Christopher Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So one to a couple follow up. So first on this seasonal business and the impact of the weather, overall, how would you assess the weather impact last year in December is really wet. I think you called out 85 basis points of headwind a year ago, you also had warm weather in January against Polar Vortex at the end there last year, but at the same time, you didn\u2019t get the snow melt and the snow blower. So how would you assess your overall impact of weather?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Chris, this is Ted. I\u2019d say neutral. It\u2019s just, as you said, extended season in some markets, the grounds not freezing, et cetera, that Pros could stay at work. But then on the other hand, you didn\u2019t get all your cold weather categories, so our merchants in shore and snow and ice melt business aren\u2019t as happy as some of our other merchants. But I would say on balance a little impact neutral?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then on the gross margin, so sequentially, the performance was better relative to the third quarter. You mentioned shrink and mix were still headwinds. And that, obviously, you talked about the Analyst Day they persisted into \u201820. But it did get a little bit better, what was the -- what shifted in the sense there and help offset that or did one of those factors mitigate, and does it change your view as you think about 2020?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shrink was consistent with what we have observed through the year and we are taking steps to address that in 2020 as we discussed. We had some great benefit as we\u2019ve had all year from some of the supply chain investments we\u2019re making and productivity supply chain, but shrink was consistent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so the delta versus last quarter, anything to call out there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s really -- it\u2019s a consistent trend, and as I said, we\u2019re looking to address it started 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christopher Horvers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks so much. Have a great spring</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Chris.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from a line of Michael Baker with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks. A couple here. So one, the comp outlook for next year, 3.5 to 4. This year your comp at 3.5, but you were hurt by least 50 basis points from lumber. So essentially you got into a slow down next year and in fact the slowest comp in a number of years, when you adjust for inflation, yet housing seems to be getting better. So just curious disconnect there. Is it just sort of setting up for some potential upside?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean like -- our methodology that we use, hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s not a perfect model. But Richard, do you want to just walk through this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Sure. We stay consistent with our methodology providing sales guidance and if you look at the elements of that methodology from GDP assumptions to what we\u2019re thinking with respect to support from housing to the expectation that we will continue to take share. None of the assumptions behind those elements has changed significantly since December and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re reconfirming that outlet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I -- one comment, I guess, people have always tried to think about our business as it relates to interest rates, just so we have never been able to correlate sales to interest rates. So that doesn\u2019t come into our thinking as a result.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I guess a follow-up on that. You would think that your business correlates to housing, right, which I guess in turn correlates with interest rates. Is that a fair statement?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a fair statement. We -- and certainly, we\u2019ve seen some of the indicators in very recent in the very recent time period, pick up a bit, but we\u2019re not going to adjust guidance based on short-term fluctuations or observations in housing. We think housing is healthy and stable. It\u2019s going to continue to provide positive support for business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That makes sense. If I can follow up, as I recall, the third quarter was hurt a little bit by the timing of Black Friday. So presumably that helped the fourth quarter, I get the shift in the month within the quarter, but third quarter versus fourth quarter, did that help fourth quarter at all, and if so by how much?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. It was it was roughly a 35 basis points shift those ways, so it hurt Q3 about 35, it shifted that to Q4 by 35.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. If I could slide in one more, you didn\u2019t -- you said you don\u2019t change your methodology and how you comp, but you are changing the methodology on the dividend, just wondering why you\u2019re changing that is just a new CFO and a different way to think about it or do something, some other reason we should think about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. Look, we are maintaining our policy of wanting to increase our dividend every year as we grow earnings. We\u2019re not going to tie to a specific payout ratio. But I think that this year\u2019s increase of 10% is a great example of our intention to continue increase the dividend and also reflection of our confidence in business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Baker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Make sense. Appreciate the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from a line of Karen Short with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karen Short</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks. Actually just follow-up on that comment on the dividend, so is there a specific relationship we should think about as it relates to EPS growth versus dividend growth, because obviously, as you said, a 10% increases very impressive, given that in 2020, you\u2019re kind of only looking for call it a 2% increase in earnings and presumably earnings growth will accelerate in \u201821?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, our general philosophy around capital allocation hasn\u2019t changed at all in terms of, first and foremost, we\u2019re going to invest what we need to enter the business to continue to position this business to win for the long-term. Then based on access cash, we look at whatever opportunities might exist out there and we are committed to increasing our dividend on an annualized basis as we grow earnings. And then we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to return dollars to the shareholders down any other opportunities through share repurchase. So those are the fundamental basics that you know we hold true in this business. We still want to -- we do control ourselves to a percentage basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karen Short</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the 14% operating margin guidance, obviously, you came in a little a little bit higher this year at 14.4%, is anything to call it there in terms of the 40-basis-point decline versus the prior 30-basis-point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. It\u2019s really just a reflection of outperformance in Q4 and sort of rounding up to a 14.4% rather than, than our expectations around 2020, which has not changed. But with great execution across the business from sales to gross margins to operating expense, it was a team effort and we\u2019re proud of the results we deliver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karen Short</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just last one for me, is there any update you could provide on additional personalization and functionality on the B2B and maybe any color you could provide on behavior with the Pros and/or conversions with respect to the ones you\u2019ve on-boarded?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Look, we continue to drive engagement with the Pros that we\u2019ve on-boarded to the B2B website. We like what we see as those Pros accelerate their engagement and -- but again, it -- we are also, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re building a complete ecosystem around the Pro. The B2B website is one portion of that experience but encompasses all the things that I laid out before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Karen Short</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.

At a meeting in December, we spent a lot of time talking about the investment initiatives. And then you would highlight the benefits of some of these were not coming as quickly as you initially thought that they were still coming. I guess, I want an update there, as we look at the business now, you had a very nice quarter, you seem -- excited about the initiatives. Have you seen more progress on that front then was articulated in December?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think, as we shared in December that, we would continue to see the investments have a payback as we move forward and that is what we\u2019re seeing. I think the quarter in particular, as Ted called, was a combination of the strength that we see in terms of the events that we put in place, the product offering that we brought to the market, the continued development of our initiatives. It\u2019s all those things coming together that actually delivered on this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, yeah, we\u2019re pleased with the continued growth that we see in the initiatives. But at the same time, really proud of the team, the execution by our stores was outstanding. The supply chain team did a great job. Our suppliers gave us outstanding products and values. And the customer\u2019s ability to start that shopping experience in the digital world and research product and/or purchase product there, all of that is leading to the kind of performance that we saw in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Then my follow up Craig and I guess so much of questions on shrink and other topic we spent a lot of times discussion in the December Analyst Meeting. How much of a swing factor could shrink be here in 2020 to the extent that you were able to improve the performance versus what we saw in 2019?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think as we shared in December, we\u2019re in the process of implementing our initiatives to mitigate the impact from shrink. It will take time for us to actually realize the benefit as that flows through the P&amp;L because we basically do the inventory in the stores once a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it\u2019s a phased rollout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve piloted approaches. We feel very confident about those results, but we still learn as we go. We feel confident. And as Craig said, not only do you have the rollout, but you also have the actual recognition in the P&amp;L, which is on a lag basis as we take inventories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brian Nagel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you and good luck to the spring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from line of Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Suzuki</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you. Regarding the margin guidance for 2020 can you talk about what assumptions you\u2019re making for product margin and the mix impacts on gross margin?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. For competitive reason, we don\u2019t detail that\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. We wouldn\u2019t do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Suzuki</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So on -- and but there\u2019s no expectation that mix could be negative given that appliance sales have been so strong, for example, or is there anything built into your gross margin assumption in terms of mix?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, there is, and as we had outlined in December, and if you think about the walk to the 14.0% guidance. You start with the fact that we\u2019re going to generate operating expense leverage on a business as usual basis, sort of underlying everything. But then recall, this is the peak year of investment of our three year investment program. So that will put pressure on margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then we see the impact from shrink, which is we said, we\u2019re taking steps to address and also from mix, but the mixed pressure is a good pressure. This is the pressure that reflects the fact that we\u2019re taking share in categories, like appliances like power tools, like outdoor power. And so, while we do think that there is mix pressure there, our objective is to grow incremental market share, incremental sales and incremental operating profit dollars and we do that through attacking our market opportunities in front of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Suzuki</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Okay. And has there been products that have been excluded from terrorists retroactively where you\u2019re now getting refunds and are those refunds a positive offset to your cost of goods sold?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would say, first off, huge thank you for our combined merchandising finance supply chain global sourcing team as they\u2019ve worked through this tariff issue all year and we put a lot of effort on it and the teams did an exceptional job that follows into the exclusions because that\u2019s a whole body of work that, excuse me, you need to follow what\u2019s being submitted and requested to be excluded and literally get it down to the skew identifier and then file all the requisite paperwork to get the approvals, that the massive body of work that the team is currently undertaking. And one big category, huge growth category for us that has been excluded now is luxury vinyl plank in the flooring business, that\u2019s probably the single biggest one and we\u2019re actively working to get that refund back from tariffs previously paid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Suzuki</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So those -- and have those refunds impacted your fourth quarter at all or are they more going forward you\u2019re likely to see some of that impact in the first half of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There was some of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There was some benefit, but ins and outs of the quarter, we still feel great about the overall performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Elizabeth Suzuki</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from a line of Zach Fadem with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Zach Fadem</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Good morning. Curious if you could speak specifically to the outlook for your e-commerce business in fiscal \u201820. And given all the initiatives around fulfillment and Pro, curious whether you expect that 20% growth handle to continue whether you\u2019re still adding any categories and what you think that 2020 drivers could be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re excited about our e-commerce business as part of a whole interconnected retail strategy. We believe that the front door of our store is not on the customer\u2019s pocket, it\u2019s on the job site that most of our customer shopping experience actually starts in the digital world even if it finishes in the physical world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Ted has talked about, we have expanded our assortment into more categories online around the home. We think that is a continued opportunity as customers have shared with us that they believe that we can bring great value in these home categories and they trust us to bring that value. So we think that our digital business continues to be an engine for growth, both in the digital world and in the physical world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Decker</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it\u2019s not a separate business. It is it is managed by our merchandising team, all one merchandising team, right? And so rather than think about a separate business, you have to think about as a capability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Zach Fadem</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And on the appliance category curious if you could talk a little more about the impact of taking home delivery in-house and considering your share gains in the category over the past several years. Could you comment on how much you think share wise is still up for grabs and where do you think it\u2019s coming from?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Holifield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. We are really pleased, excuse me, it\u2019s Mark. We\u2019re really pleased with the work we\u2019ve done in our market delivery operations or MDOs. Those are staffed with orange apron, The Home Depot associates who are ensuring that the freight comes into those locations and is dispatched properly to the customer damage free. And they\u2019re also working to ensure that there\u2019s a great customer experience they\u2019re working with the delivery teams.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I really pleased with the progress there. As Craig mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ve got a dozen of those up. We have another dozen or so leases signed, and we\u2019re going to continue to roll those out through 2020 and as we do we continue to see an improvement to our on time performance, reschedule rate and or customer satisfaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Craig Menear</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I\u2019d say an opportunity to keep growing. There\u2019s still lots of participants regional, super regionals, even mom and pop furniture stores that have clients offering. So we think there\u2019s still lots of share out there. I mean, clearly, Shears had been a donor over the years and very markedly diminished store base. But we still see just a huge market that we\u2019ve had a disruptive attitude in this space for a long time and that\u2019s continuing to pay dividends as we picture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Zach Fadem</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Appreciate the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Isabel Janci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Christine, we have time for one more question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. A couple follow ups here, first, on the guidance and specifically the cadence. Richard, I think he gave us a comp cadence similar throughout the year. How should we be thinking about gross margin and SG&amp;A, and I guess, just the cadence of investments. Should we be thinking about more pressure on the operating margin in the first half relative to the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, we think about it in halves and we don\u2019t provide specific half guidance. We\u2019re looking in a relatively balanced year across the house.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Okay. And then just to follow up on the exit rate, January being a better month here, should we be thinking about any sort of pull-forward because of weather? Or do you think it\u2019s some combination of your initiatives and just solid demand overall? And then just some related piece here around the macro, it sounds like you\u2019re maintaining a relatively conservative view. I guess, my question is really are you seeing any sort of improvement or divergence in maybe markets that we\u2019re slowing last year and are starting to get a little bit better, any change in performance there that would maybe lead you to believe that housing backdrop is just better for the business right now? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Richard McPhail</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d say, first of all, on regional variability, this past quarter was one of the narrowest we\u2019ve seen in recent times and we don\u2019t see any widespread variability. It\u2019s really early to determine how the business plays out for the first half. We\u2019ve always talked about this in terms of halves because anything can happen from a weather standpoint that could either accelerate or delay a spring and then you generally work to capture that in the first half. That\u2019s really our approach. We\u2019re not seeing anything that would have us any differently to that whatsoever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Sigman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Understood. Thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We have reached the end of our allotted time for questions. Ms. Janci, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Isabel Janci</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you, Christine. Thank you for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our first quarter earnings call in May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.
