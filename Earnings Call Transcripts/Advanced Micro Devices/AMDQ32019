Lisa?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lisa Su</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m pleased with our strong third quarter execution and results. We delivered our highest quarterly revenue since 2005, our highest quarterly gross margin since 2012 and increased net income significantly, all driven by our first full quarter of 7-nanometer Ryzen, Radeon and EPYC processor sales. Third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% year-over-year and 18% sequentially, and we expanded gross margin by 3 percentage points year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. Revenue increased 36% year-over-year and sequentially. Demand for Ryzen desktop and notebook processors drove a significant increase in unit shipments and ASP, resulting in our highest client processor quarterly revenue since 2011.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We saw particularly strong demand for our top-end Ryzen processors, and believe we gained client processor unit share for the eighth straight quarter. In desktops, we are seeing strong demand for Ryzen 3000 and previous generation Ryzen 2000 processors. Both product families are consistently among the top sellers at leading e-tailersand retailers globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In commercial, HP and Lenovo announced new desktop PCs powered by our Ryzen PRO 3000 Series processors in the third quarter. We are continuing to expand our presence in the commercial market as more financial, retail, education, and healthcare customers purchase AMD-based PCs and Chromebooks to power their businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are on track to expand our desktop product offerings in November with the launches of the industry\u2019s first 16-core mainstream desktop processor as well as our third-generation Ryzen Threadripper processor family. These products will offer unmatched combinations of core counts, performance, and energy efficiency for the most demanding high-end desktop and content creation applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In mobile, we had another quarter of strong double-digit percentage notebook processor revenue growth, driven by a richer product mix and increased unit shipments. The number of AMD-powered laptops from major OEMs has increased by 50% this year, including multiple premium notebooks like the first-ever AMD-powered Microsoft Surface laptop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We collaborated closely with Microsoft over several years to develop the AMD-exclusive, 15-inch Consumer Surface Laptop 3, which includes a custom Ryzen Microsoft Surface Edition processor and multiple operating system and software optimizations that will benefit all AMD-powered Windows systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are very pleased with our momentum in the client business this year and expect client processor revenue to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter, as we head into the seasonally strong holiday season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In graphics, revenue increased year-over-year, driven largely by higher channel GPU sales. Shipments of our Radeon 5000 GPU family featuring our RDNA architecture increased sequentially, and we are seeing solid demand for the new products based on their competitive performance and features.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For mainstream gamers, we began shipping the Radeon RX 5500 GPU in the third quarter. Acer, HP, Lenovo, and MSI announced plans to offer the new GPU in their upcoming PCs, and multiple AIB partners plan to launch RX 5500 cards during the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Data Center GPU sales were down sequentially and roughly flat year-over-year. We added multiple cloud and HPC wins in the quarter, highlighted by Microsoft\u2019s announcement of a new remote desktop offering for graphics-intensive workloads powered by EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are making good progress growing this margin accretive part of our business, as we continue expanding our footprint with marquee customers and targeted data center workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom segment. Revenue decreased 27% from a year ago, as significantly higher server processor revenue was offset by lower Semi Custom sales. We expect Semi Custom demand to further soften in the fourth quarter, now that both Microsoft and Sony have announced new AMD-powered consoles for holiday 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In server, we had our highest quarterly CPU revenue since 2006, as strong second-generation EPYC processor demand drove a greater than 50% sequential increase in unit shipments and revenue. Second-gen EPYC processors are the highest performance server CPUs in the industry and have set more than 100 world records.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our newest EPYC processors feature up to 64 cores and deliver a 25% to 50% TCO advantage versus competitive offerings. As a result of our clear performance leadership and differentiated feature set, we are building momentum with cloud, enterprise, and HPC customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In cloud, Amazon AWS, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, OVHCloud, Twitter, and Tencent, all announced plans to deploy EPYC processors in their data centers. At our launch event, Google became the latest mega data center provider to adopt EPYC processors, as they announced second-generation EPYC processors have been deployed across their internal infrastructure production data center environment and will also be used to power the Google Cloud Platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In enterprise, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo more than doubled their AMD-powered server portfolio, as they launched new platforms featuring second-gen EPYC processors, helping us add dozens of new telecom, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and energy customers in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also secured multiple new HPC wins in the quarter, including three separate U.S. Department of Defense supercomputers and what is expected to be the fastest scientific computer in the UK. We expect server revenue to grow sequentially by a strong double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter, as we continue ramping our second-generation EPYC processors. We remain on track to achieve our near-term goal of double-digit server CPU share by mid next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In summary, we are right where we want to be on our long-term strategic plan. We have the strongest product portfolio in our history. We executed our product launches and production ramps very well in the third quarter, as our new products drove higher revenue, margin expansion, and increased profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re on track to exit 2019 with another quarter of significant growth, driven by the ramp of our 7-nanometer products and believe we are well-positioned to build on our momentum in 2020 and beyond, as we deliver an even stronger set of leadership products that can drive sustained growth and increase share of the $75 billion market for high-performance computing and graphics technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Devinder Kumar</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong third quarter financial results with revenue of $1.8 billion, up 18% quarter-over-quarter and our highest quality revenue since the fourth quarter of 2005. The third quarter showcases our financial momentum and the strength of our business model with operating income and net income growing significantly year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Quarterly revenue was 9% \u2013 up 9% from a year ago, as strong sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and Radeon Gaming GPUs more than offset lower Semi Custom sales. Gross margin of 43% was up 320 basis points from a year ago, our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating expenses grew 13% year-over-year to $539 million, primarily driven by increased R&amp;D investments and support for our new product introductions. Operating income was $240 million, up $54 million, or 29% from a year ago, due to increased revenue from new higher-margin products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating margin was 13%, up 210 basis points from a year ago. Net income was $219 million, up $69 million, or 46% from a year ago, and diluted earnings per share was $0.18 per share, compared to $0.13 per share a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 36% year-over-year, driven by strong client processor and gaming GPU sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $179 million, compared to $100 million a year ago, driven by higher Ryzen processor sales. Enterprise Embedded and Semi Custom segment revenue was $525 million, down from $715 million the year \u2013 the prior year. As anticipated, Semi Custom revenue was low in the third quarter, as the market awaits next-generation AMD-power game consoles from Sony and Microsoft.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">EPYC data center CPU revenue grew by over 50% sequentially, driven by shipments of our second-generation product in the quarter. EESC segment operating income was $61 million, compared to $86 million year \u2013 a year ago, due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the balance sheet. I\u2019m very pleased with the continuing improvement of our balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter higher than the gross debt of $1.1 billion, resulting in AMD being net cash positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we retired $206 million of debt, which resulted in a loss of $40 million recorded on our GAAP income statement. The reduction in debt included $126 million of convertible senior nodes in exchange for 16 million shares. Year-to-date, we have reduced gross debt by $441 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Free cash flow was positive $179 million in the third quarter and cash flow from operations was $234 million. Inventory was $1 billion, up slightly from the prior quarter in anticipation of higher revenue in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million, compared to $227 million a year ago, driven by higher quarterly earnings. On a trailing 12-month basis, adjusted EBITDA was $745 million and gross leverage at the end of the quarter was 1.5 times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect revenue to be approximately $2.1 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 48% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The sequential and year-over-year increases I expected to be driven by growth in Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processor sales, offset by a further softening of Semi Custom processor revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, for Q4 2019, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 44%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $535 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $22 million; and fourth quarter diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.21 billion shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, we had an excellent third quarter and remain focused on ramping our leadership portfolio of high-performance products to deliver strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Laura for the question-and-answer session. Laura?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Laura Graves</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Devinder. Operator, we\u2019re ready to go ahead and pull for our first question, please.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one for Lisa. You had mentioned the total cost of ownership in your prepared comments. And I wonder, I guess, I could imagine that the total cost of ownership over a lifetime of a 7-nanometer server chip might be greater than the price of a server chip when compared to a 14-nanometer server chip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe just clarify the comments you made on total cost of ownership and quantify if that is the case how you see it? And how many \u2013 what percentage of your data center customers actually look at total cost of ownership in evaluating the products? Is it \u2013 does everybody do that, or do some just look at the price? And I\u2019m wondering like, what do you think that has \u2013 impact that might have on the competitive pricing environment? That\u2019s the first question. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, I mean, maybe let me give some context on sort of the data center business for us, and then I\u2019ll answer your question. But I think from what we see, there is a very strong value proposition for Rome. When you look at just what we\u2019re able to do from just the amount of performance, the power consumption, and then how that plays into total cost of ownership, we see it across all workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, whether you\u2019re talking about a virtualized environment, or you\u2019re talking about high-performance computing, or you\u2019re talking about the enterprise sort of workloads, we see a strong performance as well as strong total cost of ownership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To your exact question, I think, server purchases \u2013 or server purchasers are very, I would say, sophisticated. And so, in most cases, total cost of ownership is definitely in the conversation. And it\u2019s not just about performance, but performance at a given power level and also in terms of given density. And that has played out in a number of our customer engagements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, the overall point of \u2013 we think that Rome is very well-positioned. Price in and of itself is one factor, but I would say it\u2019s not the primary factor. I think the performance, power, total cost of ownership are all important buying factors. And we\u2019ve seen very, very strong engagement from customers across the Board, across all workloads for these drivers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And a follow-up, if I may. On the \u2013 when you think about your share gain \u2013 that your potential to gain share as you look into 2020, can you talk about what you view as the biggest potential gating factors in that? And like how you\u2019re managing those potential factors? And I\u2019m hoping you can talk to your view on availability of 7-nanometer wafers or and engineering support for your customers who are trying to put together solutions? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Sure, Mark. So, a couple of different questions there. Let me try to get through it. I will say since our launch of Rome in August, we\u2019ve had a very strong start. We had a full quarter of revenue here in the third quarter, and we saw that in sort of the ramp of units and revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we are seeing is that, the qualifications are going faster with the second-generation of EPYC than with the first-generation, so customers are familiar with our platforms. In some cases, customers are doing drop-in platforms, and so they can take virtually the same or a very similar platform that they had for first-gen and drop-in the second-gen, they\u2019re familiar with our architecture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, I think, from a market share standpoint, we feel good about the transition from Naples to Rome. I think the platform readiness across our OEMs and number of platforms that we have across the major OEMs is also very strong, and we\u2019re pleased with the set that are \u2013 that have both new and existing platforms there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, from the standpoint of where we are going in the fourth quarter into 2020, I think we feel very, very good about where we are with the data center customers. As it relates to customer support and all that stuff, like I said, customers are much, much more familiar with the architecture in the second-generation compared to the first-generation, and that is good for the ramp of Rome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to, I think, you asked about the 7-nanometer ramp and the availability there, we had a very large ramp here in the third quarter with 7-nanometer. We essentially ramped three full product families; Ryzen, EPYC, as well as our Radeon Gaming product families in the third quarter, and it went very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re very pleased with it. It\u2019s the fastest ramp that we have done certainly in recent memory. And going into the fourth quarter and into 2020, I think, we feel very good about the availability of Rome, as well as the rest of our products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Very helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question today is coming from David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much. Can you give us an idea of what your revenues were from 7-nanometer products in the September quarter and what you reckon they\u2019ll be in the December quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think what I can say, David, and I\u2019ll start, maybe Devinder has some additional comments. The ramp for 7-nanometer has gone very quickly in \u2013 here in the third quarter. When we look at overall new product revenue, certainly in the third quarter, we had a significant piece of that, the 7-nanometer. That will increase, again, as we go into the fourth quarter as well. And so, the way to think about it is for our major product lines. We\u2019re transitioning very fast from 14 to 7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. And within your Computing and Graphics segment, is that 36% sequential growth? So could you give us some idea of how \u2013 what client CPU sales grew sequentially? And separately, what the PC GPU sales sequential growth was?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, if you look at the CG segment from a sequential standpoint, we saw the client CPUs increase the most, and those were certainly the driver being both desktop and mobile. Desktop was higher than mobile, but both grew very nicely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at GPUs overall, they actually declined a bit sequentially, and that decline was primarily driven by data center GPUs, which declined just due to some of the buying cycles in the cloud. Overall, gaming did well, and we continue to expect that. As we go into the fourth quarter, you\u2019ll see that the data center GPUs will increase, as well as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that client and graphics would also increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Wong</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Before I jump into questions, just congrats to Devinder on being cash positive. The \u2013 Lisa, a couple of questions on Rome. We\u2019ve been tracking some of the strength at Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. But I wonder if you might comment a little bit about the server business in China, given some disruptions there just to overall CapEx, and also the OEM business that you\u2019re now ramping with Dell, HP, and Lenovo, and how you expect those things to trend over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So Matt, as we look \u2013 so let me answer the first question as it relates to the cloud customers. I think we are very pleased with the cloud adoption. We are engaged across all major Tier 1 and many of the Tier 2 service providers, and I think we\u2019re making good progress there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates specifically to China, we are well engaged. There are in both cloud and enterprise. Obviously, there is a little bit of disruption due to some of the China customers that are on the entities list, and we follow that closely. But as it relates, overall, I think, we believe that there is strong pull for Rome both across cloud as well as enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the enterprise side, what I will say is that, the HPC market has been really good for us. And so we have won quite a few of the bids and they tend to be early adopters of the technology. And so that\u2019s one indication of the strong value proposition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we go into more general enterprise, the launch of HPE, Dell and Lenovo, as well as Super Micro and the other ODM platforms is broader than our \u2013 the first-generation of EPYC and we\u2019re seeing that in the pipeline that we see. So a lot of activity going on right now. And we feel really good about how that\u2019s going to develop over the next couple of quarters in terms of enterprise wins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much for that. Just as a follow-up from me on the client business, obviously a lot of progress that\u2019s been made with the results that you\u2019ve just put up. And I kind of go back to some comments made by your primary competitor on their call, I think, talking about tightness in their own 14-nanometer supply, and also that they maybe not addressed some of the lower tiers of the market yet, your ASPs are up quite strongly. I wonder how much some of the supply tightness from your competitor might have led to these gains versus what sort of the merits of your own product? If there\u2019s anything you could talk about that, Lisa, that\u2019d be really helpful? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Sure, Matt. So the client business has really had a very strong year. I mean, if you look at how it\u2019s played out over the last couple of quarters, I\u2019ll say that, in our desktop portfolio, the third-gen Ryzen has done very, very well. It\u2019s extremely well-positioned. And where we\u2019re seeing the highest demand is at the highest tier sort of in the Ryzen 9 and the Ryzen 7. And so that\u2019s why you see the ASP strength in the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mobile is also ramping very nicely. And what we\u2019re seeing, again, in mobile is the mix of Ryzen is now a predominant mix of the business. And we\u2019re seeing actually very nice momentum in commercial, as well as our traditional consumer markets. So we also see good sequential growth in ASPs there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is some noise in the system as it relates to some supply constraints and all that stuff. I would view that as mostly, again, it\u2019s pockets at the low-end. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a significant driver of our business. Our business is driven primarily by our new platforms, the fact that we are in a number of premium platforms on both the notebook side, as well as just the strength that we\u2019re having in the DIY channel is there, and that\u2019s contributing to the positive mix, as well as the unit growth in the client business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matthew Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth and execution. I have two questions as well. Lisa, first on the data center business, I know you mentioned the target is still to be on track for double-digit kind of unit share sometime in the middle of next year. Could you help us level set as to where the share is in Q3 and what the target is in Q4? And if you have seen your competitor react to your server share gains in anyway through pricing or other means?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, Vivek, as you know, we don\u2019t necessarily want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of server share. But what we will say is, our \u2013 the Q3 quarter was our highest units sort of with EPYC. And so we are seeing good strength and predominantly a very fast transition to Rome. We expect that to continue to go \u2013 grow as we go into Q4 and into the first-half of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is about more platforms ramping and multiple platforms within a given customer. And you should see, we saw a number of announcements around our launches here in Q3, and you should see additional announcements as we go into the fourth quarter, as well as the first-half of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your question about, do we see any unusual activity from a competition standpoint? Look, our view is that the competition is aggressive. We\u2019ll always be aggressive and we\u2019re counting on that. It\u2019s a very competitive market out there. That being the case, I think, we are feeling very good about how our product is positioned and also the readiness of the product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the question earlier about, are the platforms ready? How is the customer support? I think, it\u2019s very strong. And I think our OEM and ODM partners have done a phenomenal job with the breadth of platforms and that will help us continue to grow overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. And for my follow-up, please. I had kind of a longer-term conceptual question, which is, it\u2019s good to see gross margins improving and the cost discipline. But do you think this is the time to actually increase OpEx a lot and really go after maximizing footprint, right, adding more resources, more systems, rather than trying to optimize profitability? I\u2019m just curious to hear how you are looking at the puts and takes around, whether you should be maximizing footprint rather than profitability at this level?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Look, it\u2019s a good question, Vivek. I get asked it from time to time. What you will see is, I think, we\u2019re very cognizant of where we\u2019re going. So in other words, the roadmap, and I mean, the long-term sort of financial roadmap, I think, we understand pretty well. We want to show leverage on both top and bottom line, and that\u2019s certainly our goal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We did spend a little bit more this year than we originally planned, and that was frankly, because the opportunities are very strong. And most of the additional spend is targeted at R&amp;D with the notion of platform investments, software investments to ensure that we capture the opportunities that we have. I think we have the right balance, Vivek. And certainly, as we go into 2020, we\u2019ll continue to look at that balance. But I think we are very well balanced between top line and bottom line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Congratulations, guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Lisa, I guess, my first question is, can you help me understand a little bit about the traction you\u2019re getting in the enterprise market on both Ryzen and in EPYC? And kind of what milestone should we be looking at relative to that sort of vertical?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So the \u2013 we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities for us in the commercial space. And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street, as well as just general go-to-market around commercial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Starting with Ryzen. I think, you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger. And it\u2019s not just the number of platforms, but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have a very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is a stronger part of the PC market. And we\u2019ll continue to talk about that as it relates to new platforms. Certainly, as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think, you\u2019ll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We\u2019re investing heavily in security and manageability and all those other aspects that are important in the commercial space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to EPYC in the enterprise, I\u2019m actually very encouraged with what we see in the enterprise. We had originally said that, we thought we would be more cloud, sort of cloud would go first and then enterprise would take longer. I think, what we currently see is, cloud is certainly a big driver of our business, but our enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that, the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have had a number of engagements. I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in enterprise across our top OEM has increased very significantly, just in the last sort of two months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC, as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think is strong and we\u2019ll continue to build that out as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. Lisa, then may be from my follow-up, as really the analyst community look out to modeling 2020, the GPU/CPU is relatively straightforward relative to market share expectations we might have. I\u2019m just kind of curious if you could give us some help on the Semi Custom business, it\u2019s impacted by ASC 606 and also we\u2019ve got a new gaming cycle next year. I know you don\u2019t want to preannounce customer product. But how should we think about the Semi Custom business trending throughout 2020 in broad strokes?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So I think it\u2019s a good question and we will certainly give you more guidance as we get into 2020. But the way to think about it at a high level is, we are going to a product transition with Semi Custom now. And in 2019, for example, we\u2019ve had the unusual cycle where the second-half of 2019 is pretty soft for Semi Custom compared to the first-half. And what you should expect in 2020 is that that would flip strongly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think both of our large customers have said that, they\u2019re planning a holiday 2020 launch. That would mean that the Semi Custom business would be quite heavily weighted in the second-half. So you should expect that revenue in the first-half will be, again, quite soft, with a strong recovery in the second-half of the year. And the way I look at it is, the gaming business, the console business is a strong business for us. And so it will be one of the growth drivers as we go into 2020 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about gross margins. I mean, I guess, I\u2019m glad to see them up. But given what\u2019s going on with the mix, I mean, I think you said GPUs were down sequentially. We\u2019ve got data center up more than 50%, Ryzen is growing, you have the Samsung IP in there. I guess, I\u2019m just surprised not to see them up more, both in the quarter, as well as into Q4. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of more color about what\u2019s driving that margin evolution, given the positive drivers of mix that I think should be there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think if you look at it from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, you were talking about Q2 to Q3, you\u2019re right about the mix of the product, in particular, with the ramp of the 7-nanometer products and the margins are up. Last quarter, we had, call it, 41% and this time is slightly above 43%. And that is fundamentally due to the new product that are ramping and, obviously, some benefit from the Semi Custom business has been down slightly in Q3 compared to Q2. So that\u2019s that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then as you get into the Q4 timeframe with the guide at 44% is driven by the new leadership products. Demand for the high-end of the product \u2013 of our products pack is driving a richer mix. And obviously, there\u2019s a little bit of benefit, as Lisa said earlier, with the soft Semi Custom revenue. So I think, overall, it\u2019s interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I thought those new products were supposed to have gross margins in aggregate of over 50%, and they\u2019re driving like a massive mix shift and even we\u2019ve got gross margins up a couple of points?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026which seem like what am I getting wrong?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the numbers are coming out to be a couple of hundred basis points up on a quarterly basis, with the ramp of the 7-nanometer product. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong. You have to look at the mix of the product relative to the total revenue of the company at the $1.8 billion. And I think that that\u2019s how it comes up, Stacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think, Stacy, maybe if this will help. In each of the product lines, we are certainly mixing up, and that\u2019s why you see some of the ASP goodness. But you also have some legacy product, right, and we continue to sell some legacy product as well. And so that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s perhaps the other piece.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think, as Devinder said, look, we\u2019re very happy with the way the gross margin has progressed. I think, if you look at our long-term model, we had said 40 to 44 points and we\u2019ll be exiting the year at 44. And I think very well positions us well as we go into 2020 and turnover more of the product portfolio to the new products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the EPYC server ramp into next quarter. So you\u2019re up, you said more than 50% this quarter, so that might be what $80 million to $100 million maybe sequentially, which is, I guess, good. Your competitor added almost a $1.5 billion sequentially in data center this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when you say next quarter that you\u2019re, I mean, I guess you did gain share, you got 50%, your units were up 20%, but even so. So when you\u2019re saying next quarter, you\u2019re going to grow by strong double digits on EPYC. Do you think that that\u2019s like better than the trend that we saw in Q3, it\u2019s more stuff around? So I mean, if we were up 50% sequential in Q3, do you think we could be better than that in Q4? Is that what strong double-digit means, or do you have a different meeting in mind?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think, we have in mind strong double digits. So I would say \u2013 no, and Stacy, I\u2019m not being facetious. But, again, they\u2019re all kinds of puts and takes. What I will say, though, is put in context, that the product has basically been in market since early August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if you put that in context and we\u2019re saying that the transition is going quickly. And we have a number of new platforms that are \u2013 literally they\u2019ve been in market four to eight weeks. With the way that server cycles goes, I\u2019m actually pretty happy with how it\u2019s ramping. And I expect, as I said, that Q4 will be another strong quarter for us. And it\u2019s just a matter of continuing to diligently ramp the platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Aaron Rakers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have a question and a follow-up as well. Sticking to the server or the EPYC ramp, I\u2019m just curious of out of the gate, what kind of mix have you seen maybe skewed towards the 48 and 64 core solutions? And what I\u2019m really getting at is, how do we think about the blended ASP trend on EPYC as Rome fully ramped?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So Aaron, it\u2019s fair to say that, as initially out of the chute, we are seeing a higher mix to the higher-end. So, more 48 and 64 cores as a mix. I think those are very attractive products and really taking the full advantage of the EPYC product line. We are seeing, as you might expect, with that mix that the Rome ASPs are showing lift versus the previous first-generation EPYC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we go forward, you would expect that to build out a little bit more. So, we have a full product portfolio for the server parts. But then you also expect that, you\u2019ll get more enterprise in that and enterprise tends to have a higher ASP. So the net of all that is, I can say in the server market, we feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned from an ASP standpoint. And from a sort of unit share to revenue share, I think, they\u2019re actually quite close.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Aaron Rakers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, maybe more of a model question. I think last quarter, you talked about the Semi Custom business being down in the mid-30% range. You also talked about Samsung contributions being around $100 million for the full-year. I\u2019m just curious, is that still where we stand? And what was kind of the Samsung contribution this last quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think on the Samsung base, if you look at the second-half, it\u2019s approximately $100 million, slightly about half was taken in Q3 and the other half will come in Q4. So that\u2019s absolutely right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Aaron Rakers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then \u2013 yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. On the Semi Custom side, we had said last quarter that it would be down, let\u2019s call it, mid-30%s. It\u2019s probably when you look at it in aggregate for the second-half of the year, it\u2019ll be down a bit more than mid-30%s, let\u2019s call it high-30%s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Aaron Rakers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, I had a follow-up question on your server CPU business. And I guess, the question is, when you think about pricing and sort of the margin profile that you\u2019re seeing in that business today, how does that compare with what you had planned for six or nine months ago? Is pricing and margins coming in pretty much in line with expectations, or are they coming in a little bit better?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then as you think about the margin profile for that business going into 2020, given 7-nanometer potentially maturing into next year, given the mix and given the change in customer mix from cloud to enterprise, so those two dynamics serve as tailwinds for your margins in that business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So I would say that the margin mix, as we look here in the beginning of the ramp, is about what we expected. It\u2019s about what we expected. So, the only thing I would say and I said it earlier, is the product mix is perhaps a little bit higher in the early part of the ramp. But overall, the margins are pretty close to what we expected. The pricing environment is pretty close to what we expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as we go into 2020, I think, the other piece of it is that the business scale will increase as we grow the business. And so that actually helps to absorb some of the fixed costs as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, your nearest competitor talked about pull-ins in their data center business, particularly in China. Was there anything in the quarter that you thought was kind of abnormal from a customer activity standpoint on the client side, or the server side? And if so, how big was that? And how should we think about kind of the implications into Q4 and potentially the early part of 2020? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. When we look at, both the client and server business, I wouldn\u2019t say that we saw any significant pull-ins due to tariffs or other reasons. We monitor sort of certainly, very closely the sell-in and sell-through trend. And we believe that what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the growth of the businesses is actually just new platforms running \u2013 ramping. And given where we are in the product cycle that makes sense. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that we saw any significance of pull-ins in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mitch Steves from RBC. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I just had two. I guess, first, for Devinder, I realized you don\u2019t want to provide any kind of 2020 numbers, but you already asked a 100 different ways. So may as well save you guys sometime. So if I look at the first-half of 2020, is there any reason why the gross margins won\u2019t be higher than they are in December quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I really don\u2019t want to get into 2020. There are several product transitions and play as you guys you heard in the product questions. We have a Semi Custom business that\u2019s in transition. We have obviously the rest of the business and transition the ramp in 7 nanometers. Lisa referred to some of the legacy product, so there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes. And I think, we want to talk about 2020 once we get past 2019 and put it to bed and we can come back and talk about 2020 in about 90 days from now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, gotcha. And then secondly, just for Lisa. There has been a lot of articles in terms of some firmware issues or some software bugs and things like that. Could you maybe just help us address all of them at once and just kind of talk about what you guys did to fix them? Because we\u2019re still seeing kind of articles pop-up here and there, and just want to make sure there\u2019s been no issues in terms of the software?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me make sure I understand what you mean, Mitch, which product line are you referring to, or what are you exactly referring to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So there have been specific articles in Ryzen, right, saying that there\u2019s issues with the BIOS and things like that, and performance metrics a little bit lower, but then you guys kind of really noted that you have improved them or fixed them. But we\u2019re still kind of seeing them in the market even today, for example. So just wanted to know in terms of what happened, and then secondly, if everything\u2019s been resolved?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So your question was relative to the third-generation of Ryzen. Look, I think, overall, when you look at the third-generation of Ryzen in the platforms that we\u2019ve put out, we\u2019re very, very pleased with how that ramp has gone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when we look at the sales from a sell-through standpoint, we\u2019re very pleased with where it is. There have been some platform, sort of optimizations that we\u2019ve done through working with our ODM partners and the motherboard partners to try to sort of improve the optimization of the maximum boost frequency, which is, I think, what you\u2019re referring to. And that has largely been addressed over the last couple of weeks. But I would consider that more of a optimization versus any type of major update, and we \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to improve the platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you\u2019re going to see that, as is normal with a new platform that will continue to improve the platforms over time. But I will say that, we\u2019re very pleased with how third-gen Ryzen has done in the marketplace. And we\u2019re excited with the launch of the 16 core, 3950X, as well as the Threadripper family in the next couple of weeks as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mitch Steves</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we have time for about two more questions, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Our next question is coming from Harsh Kumar from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harsh Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hey, guys, just a quick one. As you look at your leverages for gross margins, what would you consider as your greatest leverage? Is it just sales growth as you take share, or is it more products going to 7-nanometer?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think if we look at the product definitely then the new product and the 7 -nanometers are very good tailwinds for the gross margin. But also the mix of the business comes into play, the more data center revenue we capture in terms of market share, obviously, helps our gross margin, the high-end of the stack, in particular, in the client PC business that helps the gross margin. So it\u2019s basically, those are the things that have the gross margin as we go forward from 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harsh Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as you look out, where do you think margins can go?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we painted, as Lisa said earlier, when we painted our long-term target model, we painted 40 to 44 in the 2017 timeframe, that\u2019s what we said. We exit and we add 44, and we\u2019ll come back and update that sometime in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Harsh Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fair enough. Thanks, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Harsh.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot. I think in the past, you\u2019ve given the percentage of total revenue that was data center CPU and GPU combined. Can you give us that number?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, as a percentage of revenue, it\u2019s similar to what it has been in the past few quarters, although, the server portion was significantly higher, as we saw, as we said earlier, greater than 50%, sequential increase in server CPU revenue \u2013 unit shipments and revenue, so that definitely helps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, got it. Okay. And I guess, just a bigger picture question. In terms of the kind of competitive edge you have, some of it relates to process technology. But, of course, your competitor could just go to TSMC to build CPUs as well. But I guess, there\u2019s other parts that relate to your fundamental architecture, which is the chiplet memory density in your IPC advantage. So I guess, can you kind of break down, Lisa? Can you break down on how much of the advantage really is process-related versus how much is actually architecture-related? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, Timothy, the way I would answer that question is, we\u2019ve made a set of choices, and the set of choices include process technology, they include architecture, our chiplet architecture, they include sort of our overall system architecture. And I think we\u2019ve made it set of good choices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going forward, we are not relying on process technology as the main driver. We think process technology is necessary. It\u2019s necessary to be sort of at the leading edge of process technology. And so, today, 7-nanometer is a great node, and we\u2019re getting a lot of benefit from it. We will transition to the 5-nanometer node at the appropriate time and get great benefit from that as well. But we\u2019re doing a lot in architecture. And I would say, that the architecture is where we believe the highest leverage is for our product portfolio going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you, Lisa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lisa Su</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We do have a number of events planned here in the fourth quarter, and we look forward to seeing you all soon. Have a great evening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.</p>", "twitContent": "$AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
