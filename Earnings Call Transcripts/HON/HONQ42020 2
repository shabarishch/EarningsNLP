As always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Darius Adamczyk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Darius Adamcyk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Thank you, Mark, and<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide two. We finished a challenging year of a very strong quarter, driving sequential improvements from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and robust free cash flow.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. This result was up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Organic sales were down 7% year-over-year, four percentage points better than the high end of our guidance range and seven percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We drove double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in Defense and Space, fluorine products and recurring connected software sales, as well as 27% organic growth in Safety and Productivity Solutions, an outstanding result.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our cost plans delivered our full year commitment of $1.5 billion in savings and helped us protect margins, limiting our decremental margin in the quarter to only 26%, an improvement from Q3, 29% decremental margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, a significant improvement from the 130 basis point contraction in the third quarter, driven by margin expansion in Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, up from $758 million in the third quarter and 9% above Q4 2019, achieving 170% adjusted conversion. In terms of capital, we deployed approximately $2.8 billion cash dividend, growth CapEx investments, share repurchases and M&amp;A. We'll talk more about our recent M&amp;A activity on the next page.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, we deployed $3.7 billion to reduce shares outstanding by approximately 3%. With these strong fourth quarter results, we finished 2020 with $7.10 of adjusted earnings per share and an 11% organic sales decline, both above the high-end of our expectations from October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, we generated $5.3 billion of free cash flow, resulting in adjusted conversion of 105% or 16% of revenue, a very strong result. There's no doubt that the COVID-19 crisis created significant challenges for the business and economies around the world. I'm very proud of Honeywell's ability to rise to the challenge to deliver strong execution and sequentially improving results throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, let's turn to slide three to discuss our recent M&amp;A activities. I'm pleased with the progress we made in actively shaping our portfolio, and our recent M&amp;A announcements directly align with our ongoing transformation into a premier software industrial company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the fourth quarter, we completed three acquisitions and announced the fourth, all of which meet the rigorous criteria in our M&amp;A framework, which ensures that transactions are aligned with our portfolio strategy and meet our return expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have previously discussed the acquisitions of Rocky Research and Ballard Unmanned Systems, which provide emerging technologies aligned to strategic initiatives in our Aerospace business, as well as our strategic investment with path to full ownership in Trinity Mobility, which supports our smart cities breakthrough initiative in Honeywell Building Technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In mid-December, we acquired Sine Group, a technology and software-as-a-service, or a SaaS company that provides digital management solutions that are readily accessible for mobile devices. Sine's technology will enhance our connected building offerings and will also support a mobile platform for a broader portfolio of Honeywell Forge offerings. We will expand on Sine's features and solutions and make Sine's product available to customers globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Most recently, we announced an agreement to acquire Sparta Systems, a leading provider of enterprise quality management software, or QMS, with the life sciences industry for $1.3 billion. We previously highlighted the importance of the life sciences market as a breakthrough growth initiative. The acquisition of Sparta further bolsters our software, controls and analytics capabilities in this space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sparta's AI-enabled SaaS offering will combine Honeywell Forge to provide greater value to our life sciences and pharma customers. Additionally, Sparta complements our growth strategies for the automation and visualization business within Honeywell Process Solutions, enabling greater penetration in life sciences and the pharma market segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sparta will further bolster Honeywell's portfolio of accretive, non-cyclical, recurring connected software sales. I'm excited about the new technologies and adjacencies we have unlocked through our recent acquisitions and investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We said before that we have an active M&amp;A pipeline, and this series of acquisitions is further evidence that we are continuously developing our portfolio and investing in new opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also evaluate our portfolio for areas that are no longer core to our long-term objectives. Earlier this week, we signed an agreement to sell our performance and the lifestyle footwear business to a leading manufacturer of premium footwear and apparel, Rocky Brands. The transaction value is approximately $230 million and is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our SPS business will continue to provide industrial safety footwear for workers. M&amp;A is just one important part of our broader capital deployment strategy, which also includes share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let's turn to the next slide to view our total capital deployment. In 2020, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to identifying and investing in high return opportunities that help reshape the business to a software-oriented future. Over the past three years, we have consistently deployed more than 100% of operating cash flow to fund share repurchases, dividends, M&amp;A and capital expenditure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2020 was no exception. Even during a global pandemic, we deployed $7.5 billion of capital, essentially equal to the prior two years, demonstrating our commitment to investing in high-return opportunities in any environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let's turn to slide five, where Greg will discuss our execution record in a downturn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Lewis</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Darius. And good morning, everyone. We showed a slide similar to this one during our December Investor webcast. And I want to highlight it again here today, because I think it nicely summarizes our ability to manage through tough times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our execution through this year's downturn clearly demonstrates our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, to protect margins, to ensure liquidity, invest in growth and position ourselves for recovery, while at the same time, we maintained focus on our pre-transformation initiatives, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital and the integrated supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the beginning of the pandemic, we first acted quickly to address our liquidity and cost structure. Our strong balance sheet provides us with stability, as well as the opportunity for investment during challenging times, and as you saw from Darius, we took advantage of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through a series of actions to further bolster our financial flexibility, we increased our cash and short-term investments from approximately $10 billion at the end of 2019 to over $15 billion by the end of the second quarter, which we maintained through the end of the year, demonstrating our ability to generate strong cash flow and efficiently access the capital markets during even the most disruptive times, all while protecting our debt rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the cost side, we responded fast and early to the crisis by identifying and delivering on a two-phase cost program, which achieved $1.5 billion in year-over-year fixed cost savings as we had committed. Approximately 70% of these savings or about $1 billion represent a permanent reduction to our fixed cost base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To achieve this, we curtailed discretionary expenses, took temporary actions to reduce costs, including reducing Executive and Board pay, and remove significant structural costs through our repositioning programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our streamlined cost base positions us well for 2021 recovery and will drive margin expansion across all four of our segments, as well as capacity for investment as sales recover in 2021 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Darius described on the previous page, we strategically deployed capital to drive returns and to position our business for future growth. Importantly, we also directed resources to address our customer's COVID-19 challenges around the world. We've deployed additional capital into high-return growth investments to address urgent customer needs, particularly in personal protective equipment and warehouse automation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We're also helping the world cope and recover from the effects of COVID-19 through our new portfolio of healthy solutions. We generated approximately $655 million in sales for our healthy solutions in 2020, and we have a pipeline of approximately $2.1 billion, which will drive growth again in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result of our swift actions during the downturn, 4Q decremental margins were limited to 26%, improving from 33% in 2Q and 29% in 3Q and demonstrating our ability to protect our margins in a very difficult environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are clearly well-positioned for a variety of outcomes as the recovery progresses into 2021 and beyond. And our shareholders are benefiting from that with a total shareholder return of 23% in 2020, which was over two times greater than the XLI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let's turn to slide six to discuss our fourth quarter results in a bit more detail and our 2021 outlook. As Darius highlighted, we delivered a strong fourth quarter to end 2020 with sequential improvement from third quarter on all our key financial metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sales declined by 7% organically due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is four percentage points better than the high end of our guidance and represents a seven percentage point sequential improvement from the 14% organic sales decline in the third quarter, driven by sequential sales growth from the third quarter in all four segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Starting with Aerospace, fourth quarter sales were down 19% organically, a six percentage point sequential improvement from the down 25% we had in the third quarter. Lower commercial aftermarket demand due to the ongoing impact of reduced flight hours and lower volumes in commercial OE equipment was partially offset by double-digit growth in Defense and Space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Though still down significantly year-over-year, our commercial aftermarket business did improve sequentially from the third quarter. Our air transport aftermarket business was down 48% organically in the quarter compared to 55% in Q3 and our business aviation aftermarket was down 6% organically compared to 28% in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to Building Technologies, sales declined 4% - organically, a four percentage point sequential improvement from the 8% down in 3Q. Global Solutions projects were impacted by timing due to the customer order pushouts we saw earlier in the year, which is partially offset by growth in services. Customers are now placing orders for projects that they had previously delayed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, orders in Building Solutions grew 32% year-over-year and the services backlog was up double-digits year-over-year to finish the fourth quarter, position the business well for 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the building products side of the portfolio, sales and orders improved sequentially from the third quarter and the commercial fire business returned to year-over-year growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In PMT, sales were down 12% organically, a four percentage point sequential improvement from the 16% organic decline in 3Q. Process Solutions was impacted by continued delays in projects and services, as well as volume declines in thermal solutions and smart energy due to end market softness. However, Process Solutions orders were up 30% sequentially from Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">UOP continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy end markets, though sales improved sequentially from the third quarter across the UOP portfolio and orders were up 21% versus the third quarter as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, Advanced Materials sales increased 8% year-over-year organically driven by growth across the Fluorine Products portfolio, including strong auto and strong [ph] demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In SPS, organic sales were up 27% year-over-year, a very strong result to end the year in which the SPS team stepped up to meet unprecedented demand for critical safety products. Intelligrated and personal protective equipment led the way with another quarter of double-digit organic growth, followed by high single digit growth in productivity solutions and services. We are encouraged by the turnaround in 2020 that team has orchestrated in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">SPS exited 2020 with a backlog of approximately $4 billion, which was nearly double our backlog at the end of 2019, placing the business in a very strong position to start 2021, where we expect to see a robust first half in particular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we expanded margins year-over-year in three of the four segments: Aerospace, HBT and SPS, limiting Honeywell's overall segment margin contraction to 30 basis points and ending the quarter with a segment margin of 21.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This was a sequential improvement of 120 basis points from 3Q segment margins of 19.9%, an improvement of 260 basis points from the 2Q trough, demonstrating the effectiveness of our response to the pandemic, in particular, our cost actions and operational rigor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered cost actions in the fourth quarter that brought us to $1. 5 billion of savings for the year, right at the stated range that we had highlighted earlier, limiting our full year margin contraction to 70 basis points, despite the challenging operating environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.07, flat year-over-year and up 33% sequentially from adjusted EPS of $1.56 in the third quarter. This result was $0.05 above the high end of our guidance driven by higher segment profit due to better-than-expected sales volumes in Aerospace, HBT and SPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given the strength we saw in the fourth quarter, we were able to make discrete investments in the business and our employees, including in IT, marketing spend for Forge and brand expansion in the Middle East and China, as well as a special $500 recognition award for our IST frontline production and production support employees, who performed so greatly and well through this crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Repositioning was lower than in 4Q a year ago as expected, driving a $0.15 year-over-year tailwind below the line. Interest income and foreign currency were lower than 4Q '19, driving a $0.07 headwind below the line, which was offset by higher pension income. Our effective tax rate and share count were also lower than in the fourth quarter of 2019, driving $0.02 and $0.04 of EPS benefit, respectively. A bridge from 4Q '19 adjusted earnings per share to 4Q 2020 can be found in the appendix of this presentation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am also proud to report that our fourth quarter cash flow generation is very strong. We generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow, up 9% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted free cash flow conversion of 170%. Free cash flow and conversion both improved year-over-year due to working capital improvements, including introduction [Technical Difficulty] and strong collections. Our teams put an extra focus on cash in the fourth quarter and really delivered, and we expect to continue this progress in '21, particularly on inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of capital deployment, we paid approximately $670 million in dividends, repurchased $1.6 billion in Honeywell shares, over-delivering on our commitment of 1% share count reduction in 2020. We invested approximately $300 million in CapEx and deployed over $250 million to complete three acquisitions. So all-in-all, a very strong fourth quarter to close out 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let's turn to slide seven to talk about our 2021 planning assumptions. We hope and expect that the worse is behind us as we move on from 2020. We're seeing promising signs of the recovery unfolding, but there continue to be a few key uncertainties to be mindful of.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past couple of months, we've seen governments around the world approve multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines and begin rolling them out. Our current view of '21 assumes the vaccines are widely distributed, leading to lower manageable infection rates over time and allowing the global economy to largely be open and stabilize.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, many regions have recently been coping with a new wave of infections and lockdown, new COVID strains and vaccine distribution challenges. So it remains unclear when exactly infection rates will slow down materially and the economic recovery will really accelerate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a macro planning assumption, we're expecting the recovery to be weighted in the second half of the year and are expecting to experience a little bit of a slower start in 1Q.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We're assuming fiscal stimulus remain supportive of the economy in '21. We do expect passengers will begin flying more freely, again as the vaccine rollout begins, leading to a modest improvement in global flight hours in the first half and acceleration in the second half. So this is one area where we are seeing some renewed softness, particularly in China and APAC, as the year begins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also expect stability in defense budget spending. And finally, we assume improved macro conditions broadly will drive moderate increase in oil consumption in the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Given that, let's turn to slide eight and discuss our markets and segment outlook. Starting in Aerospace, the previously mentioned increase in flight hours as the pandemic subsides will gradually lead to improvements in our commercial aerospace business, as aftermarket demand accelerates, particularly in the second half. However, we expect recovery in the commercial OE business to lag the commercial aftermarket recovery due to a gradual ramp in commercial OEM build rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Stable defense spending should support continued growth in our Defense and Space business at a reduced pace versus the double-digit growth we experienced in 2020. In total, we expect the Aerospace business to be flat to up low single digits in '21.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In HBT, we expect the non-residential market to remain relatively stable in '21. We anticipate solid demand for building products and management systems in key verticals, including data centers, warehousing and healthcare. However, in other verticals, including hospitality and commercial officers, we expect them to remain challenged as the world recovers from the effects of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These challenges will be partially offset by the traction we have gaining over the past couple of quarters with our healthy building solutions with key wins in education, commercial offices, healthcare and some government verticals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our solutions address key customer concerns, including air quality, social distancing and controlled and cautious access, and we expect continued demand through the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Global Solutions ended 2020 with a quarter of strong year-over-year orders growth, which positions the business well for '21. And we expect customers to continue placing orders that they deferred in '20 as the macro economy recovers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also have a robust services backlog that is up strong double digits year-over-year and will support 2021 growth. We don't expect building access to be a significant issue in '21, so we don't anticipate any material challenges getting on sites to complete projects. In total, we expect HBT to grow low single digits for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In PMT, we expect the oil and gas and petrochemical markets to remain relatively flat, with oil consumption picking up slightly in the second half. We expect the HPS recovery to be led by our large backlog of global mega projects and the product businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In UOP, we expect the energy markets to remain challenged through the year, particularly in the first half. However, we expect business conditions will recover sooner for petrochemical, oil and gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We anticipate increasing investments in renewable fuels, which will drive demand for our new sustainable Technology Solutions business and partially offset challenges in the oil and gas market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, the specialty chemicals market is expected to grow modestly in '21, with strength in global healthcare, automotive and residential construction end markets driving demand for advanced materials. Overall, we expect PMT to be down slightly to up low single digits for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, in SPS, we expect continued strength in warehouse automation and personal protective equipment, as we execute the delivery of our robust backlog. We also expect productivity solutions and services to grow, as the strategic turnaround of the business drives market share gains, and we expect gas sensing to recover in line with the market. In total, we expect SPS to grow double digits in '21 with comps getting tough in the back half as we lap strong growth from the back half of 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, overall, we see improvement across most of our key end markets in '21 and we have confidence in our continued operational execution. The pace of the recovery may vary due to the items we discussed on the prior slide, so we are taking a cautious approach as we begin the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let's move to slide nine to discuss how these dynamics come together for our 2021 financial guidance. For 2021, we expect sales of $33.4 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents overall organic growth - sales growth in the range of 1% to 4%, reflecting double-digit recurring connected software growth and the impact of our announced M&amp;A divestitures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Segment margins are expected to expand 30 to 70 basis points, supported by higher sales volume and our streamlined fixed cost base following 2020 cost actions with investment for growth. While we expect margin expansion across all the businesses, SPS will lead the path as we scale up capacity and become more efficient, followed by aero, driven by high-margin aftermarket recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These organic growth and segment margin expectations are consistent with our long-term commitments for low to mid single digit organic growth and 30 to 50 basis points of margin expansion and give us flexibility to deliver earnings growth and invest for the future. 2020 was a challenging year, but we'll be back on track to deliver our standard commitment to shareholders in 2021 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So net below the line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, is expected to be in the range of negative $130 million to positive $20 million, which includes capacity for $400 million to $525 million of repositioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% and a weighted average share count of approximately 705 million for the year, representing our minimum 1% reduction in shares. As a result, we are guiding earnings per share of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% adjusted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We see free cash flow in the range of $5.1 billion to $5.5 billion in 2021. That represents cash margins of 15% to 16% of sales commensurate with the 2019 and 2020 rates that we have demonstrated and a cash conversion in the 95% range. Keeping in mind that our conversion, excluding non-cash pension income, would actually be approaching 115%, so very healthy on numbers overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This range does include $375 million that we expect to receive in an upfront payment from Garrett, resulting from their proposed plan of reorganization. We'll continue to include cash receipts from Garrett going forward within free cash flow in order to be comparable to prior periods, where the cash proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreement were recognized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just to spend a minute on that topic, we are pleased that Garrett has agreed to the plan of reorganization, under which they will be recapitalized and well-positioned to meet their obligations, including those to Honeywell and will avoid costly litigation. We believe this is the right path forward that maximizes value for stakeholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let's turn to slide 10, and walk through our 2021 EPS stage. Segment profit is expected to be the key driver of our earnings growth. Higher sales volumes, commercial excellence, continued productivity improvements and ongoing benefits from previously funded repositioning will contribute $0.54 per share at the midpoint of our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impact of our acquisitions of Sparta, Sine and Rocky Research and the divestiture of the retail footwear business will drive a $0.07 headwind at the midpoint. Below the line and other items are expected to be a $0.22 benefit per share at the midpoint of our guidance, primarily driven by higher pension income in '21 compared to 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'd like to take a moment to discuss those pension dynamics in a little bit more detail. We expect approximately $1.1 billion of pension and OPEB income in '21, up approximately $260 million from 2020 with the majority of this increase related to our US pension plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have de-risked our U.S. pension plan to approximately 60% of planned assets being a more conservative fixed income like assets and the remainder in return-seeking assets. As a result of another strong portfolio performance in 2020, our funds returned approximately 14%, increase in our pension asset base compared to the prior year. This higher asset base, combined with lower discount rate is driving higher income in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our diligent management and strong returns have been an important value driver for the company, putting us in a position where our pension-funded status continues to be robust, ending the year at 113%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For taxes, we expect an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%, which would result in a $0.06 headwind per share at the midpoint. And finally, our base case is that our share repurchase program will result in a benefit of $0.07 per share as we reduce our weighted outage share count from 711 million to at least 705 million shares. So in total, we expect 2021 earnings per share to be in the range of $7.60 to $8, up 7% to 13% year-over-year adjusted, nearly back to 2019 levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let's turn to slide 11 for a preview of the first quarter. As I noted earlier, we're entering 1Q with a cautious stance as the environment continues to evolve real-time, which is driving a wider than usual range for a quarter. We expect organic growth in the first quarter in the range of down 10% to down 5% organically, which brackets our fourth quarter sales growth performance, recognizing market conditions could vary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The year-over-year sales decline will be driven by continued headwinds in commercial aerospace and UOP, partially offset by ongoing strength in warehouse automation, PPE and advanced materials, as well as gradual recovery in other areas of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Keep in mind, 1Q will be our toughest comp for the year across all four segments since the first quarter of last year was only partially disrupted by the COVID pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect segment margins in the range of 20.4% to 20.9% in the first quarter, slightly below the fourth quarter based on lower sales leverage given our usual sequential step down in sales from 4Q, partially offset by ongoing productivity. That represents year-over-year segment margin contraction of 140 to 90 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have positioned ourselves with a streamlined fixed cost base for '21 and expect sequential segment margin improvement from the second quarter on. The net below-the-line impact is expected to be between a $40 million expense and a $5 million benefit with a range of repositioning between $100 million and $140 million as we continue to fund ongoing restructuring programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24% and the average share count to be approximately 705 million shares. As a result, we expect first quarter earnings per share between $1.68 and $1.83, down 24% to 17% year-on-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let's take a moment to walk through our expectations by segment. In Aerospace, we expect first quarter global flight hours to remain relatively flat from the fourth quarter. We could see a step back in 1Q in certain regions, given the flare-up in infection rates over the holidays. As a result, we expect current softness in flight hours to continue impacting our air transport and business aviation market sales in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, lower air transport OEM build rates and lower business jet demand will continue to impact our commercial original equipment business. We expect Defense and Space to partially offset the challenges in commercial aerospace, supported by stable U.S. Defense segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Building Technologies, we expect business conditions to remain similar to conditions in the fourth quarter. We don't expect significant issues accessing our customer sites as I mentioned earlier, which will enable us to deliver projects as normal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strong Building Solutions services backlog to drive growth in the quarter and we expect demand for building products to continue improving. In addition, we expect continued customer momentum with our portfolio of healthy building solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In PMT, we expect continued customer CapEx and OpEx budget reductions and project delays to impact the engineering and licensing business in UOP and projects and services in HPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In UOP, we expect continued weakness in gas processing and lower catalyst shipments due to the lower production and refining volumes. However, we do expect to see some demand return in Process Solutions product businesses and we expect another strong quarter from Advanced Materials, driven by continued demand in fluorine products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we expect continued strength in SPS with another quarter of double-digit growth in Intelligrated and Personal Protective Equipment. Our Personal Protective Equipment backlog remains up triple digits year-over-year and our Intelligrated backlog is over $2.5 billion, giving us confidence for the first quarter and the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Productivity Solutions and Services, we expect continued growth driven by market share gains and low inventory levels in the channel, due to favorable sales out of distributors. While macro conditions continued to put pressure on the sensing in IoT and gas sensing businesses, we expect strong overall SPS sales growth for the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, before I turn it back to Darius, let's look at slide 12 and talk through the ultimate measure of our performance through this crisis, total shareholder return. We're creating shareholder value in outperforming the industry in the broader market in all environments. If you look at this chart, you will see that Honeywell has shown remarkable consistency, outperforming both versus the XLI and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, indicative of the outstanding resiliency of the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Investors can depend on Honeywell to generate superior return compared to the benchmarks regardless of market timing due to our rigorous and proven value creation framework, as well as the Honeywell operating system. This crisis reinforce the fact that our value creation framework which we discussed at length in our December Investor webcast is highly effective in delivering consistent outperformance in all marketing conditions. In fact, this framework drove Honeywell shareholder returns above both the XLI and Dow Jones Industrial Average again in 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Darius.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Darius Adamcyk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Greg. Before we wrap up, I'd like to take a minute on slide 13 to discuss one of the key elements of our overall ESG story. Last quarter we discussed Honeywell's commitment to shape a safer and more sustainable future. This time, I'd like to focus on another important topic, corporate social responsibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Honeywell is committed to corporate social responsibility and community involvement, which we demonstrate through unique global programs to look to improve lives and inspire change in the communities around the world. Beyond these programs, we acted quickly throughout the course of the pandemic to address the needs of our employees, communities and customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few of our more recent actions are shown on this slide. Most recently, we announced our participation of unique public-private partnership backed by North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper to help support the goal with 1 million COVID-19 vaccinations by July 4, 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have partnered with Atrium Health, Tepper Sports &amp; Entertainment, the Charlotte Motor Speedway, the State of North Carolina to administer the vaccine, manage complex logistics and to provide operational support for mass vaccination events. We're very proud of - to be part of this effort to prevent further spread of the virus by helping frontline workers and other members of our communities to get vaccinated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another recent example of Honeywell's contribution to our communities is the important mask delivery milestone we achieved in December, where we delivered more than 225 million face masks to help protect workers in their response to COVID-19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered N95 respirators and surgical face masks to multiple locations in the US for healthcare systems, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, we shipped millions of masks to both state and local governments. We are proud of these contributions and our role in providing much needed PPE to workers around the country, responding to the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we are also committed to recognizing and respond to the needs of our employees. We recently recognized the dedication and strength of our own frontline Integrated Supply Chain production teams, who have been instrumental in keeping our manufacturing sites running safely, enabling us to meet critical customer needs during these unprecedented times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To show our appreciation, we announced a special $500 Recognition Award for each of our frontline production and production support employees. We continue to be inspired by the members of our Integrated Supply Chain team who have truly gone above and beyond to support our customers throughout this pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let's wrap on slide 14. There is no doubt that 2020 was a challenging year. However, we effectively managed through the downturn, the repercussions of the global pandemic by focusing on liquidity, cost management, strong operational execution and investment for the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We drove sequential improvement from the third quarter in sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow, creating good momentum into 2021. The past year was another proof point that the Honeywell value creation framework delivers outperformance even in the most challenging economic and market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities in the downturn to high reaching [ph] CapEx and M&amp;A, positioning ourselves for the future and the recovery to come. These growth investments will help us solve challenging problems for our customers, address critical global sustainability issues and drive superior shareholder returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'm proud of Honeywell's rapid and effective response to the challenges of 2020. Our employees around the world work hard to quickly adapt and deliver through the crisis, including ramping up production of critical PPE, developing our portfolio of healthy solutions and delivering growth in multiple areas of the portfolio. We are well positioned for a recovery in the second half of 2021 and beyond, as demonstrated by our expectation to return to our key long-term growth commitments for 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that Mark, let's move to Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Bendza</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Darius. Steven, give us a moment while we gather here for Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely, sir.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Bendza</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions. We ask that you please be mindful of others in the queue by asking only one question. Steven, please open the line for Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the details on the guidance. So your 1Q sales guide, I just wanted to dig into that. You've provided some good general detail on what you're expecting, but the midpoints have not set down very similar as what we saw in 4Q, despite much of your comps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I'm just wondering were there any - anything unusual in 4Q, any budget flushes there some speculations, there is some pre-order activity from other companies, etc. So just wondering if you've seen some type of supply chain quotings and bringing order demand maybe causes the sales guide to be essentially flat - Q-over-Q with what you saw in 4Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I don't know that there was anything unusual in Q4. I mean, I think obviously we had to see a continued ramp up of our SPS business that will continue, but it does start flattening at some point. PMT basically came out about as we expected, as we know that UOP business particularly is lumpy and the mix of the catalyst ship can vary dramatically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think if you look at overall, COVID is a big play in this, and I would say, especially if you compare the COVID situation early in Q4 versus where we are now, we're in a much worse place. I mean, that's obviously that has to weigh on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And frankly we really thought about whether or not we should guide Q1 at all. I mean, I think that we're in a place that's the level of infection throughout the world is the highest it's ever been right now and there's a lot of uncertainty. But we thought we would give sort of our best effort and provide a little wider range than normal to give our investors some of our best really educated view of where we think we're going to end up. But there is a lot of - there is more uncertainties this quarter. Greg, I don't know if you want to add anything.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, even for all of us have been traveling is a question mark. If you read the Journal this morning, they talked about the airlines and concerns even in the US about whether there's going to be testing requirements put in place for domestic travel. We know that that's been put in place already on international travel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So yes, to Darius' point, I just think there are some things out there that are really kind of hard to predict. But as I said in my remarks, I mean, the down 10 to down five kind of brackets, the down seven we had in the fourth quarter. The down 10 is in case something gets worse, that we don't really - can see at this moment, but it could be better than that if things progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So nothing - there's nothing strange. I mean, we always have a fourth quarter to 1Q decremental sequential sales. 4Q is always our strongest quarter, so nothing unusual in there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. And just to add to that, I think, actually predicting that sort of in line is probably not that unusual. And then Aerospace, which obviously is our biggest business, the things to consider there is, if you look at infection rates in fact, at least in the western world, you had holidays, the air miles flown could be actually down and we see that, we actually given some of the outbreaks that we saw earlier this quarter in China and Asia-Pac specifically is where we're seeing some pressure. So that's sort of the puts and takes of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nigel Coe</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Steve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wish I had time to read the Journal this morning. That's impressive you can read the Journal on earnings day, you must have it all wrapped up there. Just on the margin side. Pretty decent margin expansion guided for this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Assuming you guys do better on sales would there be any reason as to why those margins would be weaker than you're guiding to? Or do you think that if you do a little better on sales, you can still kind of converted at this high level?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So Steve, I think what we tried to do is position ourselves this year for anything. So, I mean if we guided something we feel like is very much deliverable in that 30 to 70 range and if sales actually turn out to be better, I think two things can happen. One we can convert a bit of a higher rate, but two, we may invest more back in the business. We have some important things to get done in Aerospace from an R&amp;D perspective. We are funding some of that already. If things get better than we think then we could let the line out a little bit further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if you look at our conversion in the last three quarters of this guide, it's really converting like 37%, just the math the 37% conversion rate in Q2 through Q4 with this guide. So we think it's a pretty strong rate of conversion, as it stands right now and we're trying to give ourselves optionality to both deliver earnings, as well as make sure we've got some room for investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is that high 30 sustainable? Is that high 30 kind of a sustainable rate going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that remains to be seen. We're - again, we're very confident that now that we're this 30 to 70 this year gets us right back in the 30 to 50 long-term framework that we've been consistently able to deliver. So that's what I can say about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I mean I think couple of points. First of all, Steve, if you take a look at our conversion rate for 2021 versus that with deconversion the leverage ratio it's fair and it's - and we project that in Q2 to Q4. The wildcard in a lot of this is Aero aftermarket, right. I mean that is probably the single hardest number for us to call because it is directly correlated to vaccinations and the speed of those vaccinations and rollout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If that comes in better than we're projecting and obviously there is upside to the margin rates. If it doesn't, well, then probably going to be someplace in the mid to lower end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think it's really important to note something else Steve, which is, if you look at the upper end of our margin rate for 2021, I mean, we get back to 2019 and up, I mean, so basically, we're kind of taking a one-year break, initially there were discussions about when will it take three years or two years to get back to that, and we're kind of getting - hope on the EPS range and so on pretty much to 2019 and a course so it's sort of a one-year break.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it's usual, we're trying to be prudent in our planning this early on in the year with this many unknowns, with the vaccine at levels that growth has never seen. So we're trying to embed that into our guidance and obviously we're going to provide you more clarity as the year progresses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One more quick one. Will you guys pretty much track flight hours in Commercial Aerospace aftermarket or will there be kind of a lag like some have talked about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is a little bit of a lag, but there'll be a correlation eventually. So, as you know, those numbers are kind of correlated. So, as we track the flight hours travel, yes there might be a bit of a lead lag. But the correlation is there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Good morning, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'll keep to one question, but hopefully you guys can answer it a little bit more broadly than perhaps what I'm asking directly, but can we talk about Intelligrated and just kind of how scalable it is. I mean your margins rising as you grow. I know the install isn't necessarily all that profitable, but are you actually seeing an improvement in margin structure perhaps because of the supply and demand imbalance maybe better pricing that's leading to better margins. I'll just leave it at that and if you can give me some color there, it would be great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, let me start on very much. I don't think we're expecting dramatic margin improvement in Intelligrated in 2021, and let me explain why? The reason is that we are just booking an incredible amount of greenfield project and you saw that it was another incredibly robust year in terms of bookings. We expect double-digit growth again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Particularly, what's really important is to look at the ratio of our aftermarket business to our projects business and as you can imagine that's not changing of anything probably the projects are growing that much faster than aftermarket.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So obviously that was going to keep pressure on the margin. But we should view that has a good news thing, because as I explained this before, eventually when the growth slows down, the growth rate will be slower, but the margin rate will be higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we're still going to be very much in this greenfield expansion mode for the next few years, which means higher growth rates, lower margins, which over time is going to moderate to lower top line growth rates and higher margins. That's sort of how that business is going to grow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What's really encouraging here is, the amount of share that we're gaining in the marketplace. There is unquestionably this business is winning and winning big in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would just add, your question about scale. That's - we talked about some of our growth investments and some of them are here to scale this business. So we are making investments in capacity and scaling up as we go both here and in Europe to - because again that was also part of the plan as well broadening our reach beyond just the US. So that's a big focus for this team. The scale question is, is one of the biggest things that they have on their plate and we're making nice progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good luck, guys. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good morning. Sort of continuing with sort of Scott's angle. Another business you announced the deal with SAP on-the-building solutions and you didn't provide a lot of details, but since then I think Latch has published an extensive debt talking about very, very aggressive market growth targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was just wondering if, given that there is a competitor there with aggressive targets for market growth, if you could just talk about maybe in a little bit more detail about opportunities that you are seeing and sort of software on the building side as this business is evolving?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I mean, a couple of things. Number one, so we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in our connected buildings offering, SAP partnership is working. We're actually still innovating together, we're launching aggressively even more aggressively into the marketplace. This quarter, next quarter as we complete some of their joint innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to give you a perspective across all of our business units, this will give you a hint as to how well this business did. Honeywell Connected Buildings business won the Business Unit of The Year across all of Honeywell. So that will tell you a lot about its financial performance. So that business is growing as fast as any business we currently have, getting traction with SAP partnership, but we're also getting traction in the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frankly it's a gap that's unfilled and we don't think that there is anything out there that is comprehensive in terms of our Connected Building solutions that we have, which really covers the full scope of energy management, occupant comfort safety, overall maintenance footprint. So it's really comprehensive just about anything and everything related we're building in. And that business is - think about high double-digit growth kind of numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Andrew Obin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from John Inch with Gordon Haskett.

Good morning, everybody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Under what scenario would PMT sales be negative in terms of your range to the low end of your guide? And I'm just thinking out loud, you do have other build exposures in floorings which is going to be really good. I would think the UOP catalyst reload likely next year based on pent-up demand and then we've got commodity prices higher. I'm just wondering how that actually plays into your thinking for this segment, both in terms of sales and margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think PMT decrementals were about 50% or over that in the fourth quarter. So, can you kind of, think about it and I'm claiming a bunch of stuff into my one question. So, there you go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe it's a good adaptation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The answer is defined. This is all about UOP, let's start with that, right. The advanced materials were pretty comfortable with the growth profile, HPS, was kind of over and up in what we're going to do, which is growth. UOP is a little bit of an unknown, right, because what we've seen can happen is that lot of the catalyst loads or re-loads get pushed out of projects, get pushed out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To give me some comfort is that our bookings in the backlog are higher entering 2021 versus what they were in 2020. So, I am cautiously optimistic, it's - we're going to see growth, but we've also seen some push outs of particularly catalyst loads and delaying in projects and if that happens, obviously we're going to have to see pressure from the UOP side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And frankly, the price of oil is at a reasonable number right now, it's not in the 30s or 40s, now it's in the 50s, which is quite receptive to investment. What worries me is that a lot of the big oil and gas majors who are our customers set their budgets just like we do in Q4 of 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So - and they've announced some pretty big cuts. So, what we don't know fully as are those, are there going to be adjustments made based on the economic conditions, based on adjustments to those budgets. There is a point, there is definitely a pent-up demand, because you can't under fund this marketplace for too long. So, whether that happens in the second half of this year or '22, that story is yet to be told.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But what we don't know is we still have a lot of sort of bookings that we expect for the second half that we have visibility to but they need to land. And that's why we provided the guide, we did because we don't know whether or not they will land or they will get pushed out to '22.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I have zero doubt and I mean zero doubt because I was in this business in '15 and '16 that there will be a big reinvestment cycle because you can't start this market for so long and that's why it's sort of, we can debate when it will come, but there is no - undoubtedly it will happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I could, just because you mentioned margins as well, I think the thing you have to keep in mind there is, is two. Number one, as Darius described, the catalyst obviously, pretty high margin and so that impacts our mix. And then the other thing is we are executing on a lot of the gas processing business that we had won back in 2019 and 2020 and a lot of that's in high growth regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, you can imagine there is a lower margin aspect of some of that business as well that we're actually executing here through 2020. So, that's been an impact to the PMT margins when you take away the catalyst business and that becomes a bigger share of the overall PMT - sorry, yes, PMT mix and UOP in particular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Just to make sure I understand. If a reload does happen, that's possibly very significant upside to the guide, but for now, you're not assuming that? So, I'm assuming PMT is probably kind of on the UOP side, sort of flat for the year. Is that's a fair statement?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. That's right, because right now those jobs are not booked in the second half. We have visibility during the pipeline but until they book it's a little bit of an uncertainty. We expect them to, but could they get pushed out to '22, absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Josh Pokrzywinski. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Josh. Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just looking at the broader Honeywell software offering, Connected and otherwise, I understand it probably varies by business, obviously, a lot of different end markets there, but can you talk a little bit about how adoption is fared and customer conversations are going?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would imagine with folks starting to pivot back to growth or investment as they expect COVID to get resolved that those should be accelerating but as you mentioned a few times Darius, there's awful lot of complexity and cases are actually worse. But how is that adoption going? And is that frontline moving higher as people are thinking about kind of post-COVID digital transformation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, I'll be honest. I wasn't - I think, we actually had a very reasonable year in 2020, despite some of the challenged markets we're in, but just to give you a couple rough numbers. If you think about our overall software growth, it's mid single-digit even in 2020 environment. And then for recurring growth because frankly, we're sacrificing some top line growth because we're really converting our entire Forge business, Forge software business is only sold as a SaaS offerings. That actually grew in the teens last year. So, that was a very good year and we actually - we expect an acceleration on both of those figures for 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But 2020 for me was a really good proof point that this business is a cyclical. And as we continue particularly to build that recurring revenue base, which is growing more than two x our served traditional software base, it's going to be a great tailwind for the future of Honeywell and the future of that software business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with offerings like we just talked about in connected buildings and our cyber offerings, I'm quite confident that it's going to continue to grow at that kind of pace. So, the short story is we're seeing more traction and we are winning more accounts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Maybe my question would be around the free cash flow outlook. So, the operating cash flow is guided to drop I think around $400 million at the midpoint, even though net earnings should be up probably high-single digits. So, just wanted to try and understand what's happening within that around sort of working capital. Is it the fact that you had that exceptional receivables tailwinds in '20 that has to reverse? Just trying to gauge how conservative or what assumptions you've got on that working cap side. Because I think that the CapEx is up, but only up maybe 10% or so?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, sure. So, as we discussed the 5.1 to 5.5, just to ground out the numbers, that's 15% to 16% of sales. So, pretty similar to what we just did at 16%, is 95% to 98% conversion. So approaching 100%, it's 113% to 115% conversion extension. So, just keep in mind relative to the base metrics are pretty healthy numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to working cap and what's happening there. Yes, I mean obviously, sales came down substantially this year and both with some transformation and effectiveness in our process, as well as harvesting receivables. We had a very big - we had a very big cash flow from AR this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We started to see some of the inventory come down in 4Q, for the year, it was still a build. And so when we think about next year, that's the area that I expect us to make more progress is on inventory and start seeing some inventory reductions, again even in the face of sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I think you're going to see, we're world-class on payables, we'll continue to make some steady progress as we do each year. We'll make some progress on our programs around transforming on our credit collections aspects. And so I would expect we'll make some more progress on past dues and DSO, but the big effort is really going to be focused around inventory in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would sort of, I think, I would classify our cash conversion in 2020 as exceptional. I mean, 105% conversion and 120% if you exclude something very positive, which is the fact that we're one of the few companies that have substantial pension income. So, we might be going from exceptional to very good. Frankly, the receivables performance was outstanding. We're not sure that can be replicated, we're certainly going to try. But we're going to focus on some other elements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I will also say we've done a nice job on advances on build too in terms of 2020. So, I thought that this performance on cash was exceptional, and if you really take a look at, especially if you adjust for pension or take a look at our cash generation as a percent of our revenue, you will find that we're in the top quartile of performance, and that's certainly...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We used to live down in 11% to 12% of sales. And now we've been posting 17%, 16%, 16%. So, we feel pretty good about what we've done here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I hopefully, by now it's sort of clear that this is not luck and it's not a one-time phenomenon, that this is actually repeatable of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good morning, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, Jeff.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning. Maybe a quick one on pension. Agreed the conversion numbers look great, especially if you adjust for that, but the fact that you're now so over-funded, is there a way except through an insurance company or something that actually kind of extract monetary value from the pension or when you speak of it is kind of a value driver, are you really kind of talking about, a, it's great that it's over-funded? And b, you can use pension income to basically offset restructuring or other kind of cost related actions you might be taking?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I mean, I guess I would say a few things. We were always looking at options around the future of the pension plan. So, that's something that we look at constantly. As far as value creation, I view it in two ways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Number one, it's a risk mitigator, I mean other companies are having to pile cash into their pension plan because they're unfunded, we don't. I can't remember the last time we put anything substantive into our pension fund, which obviously would take away from our ability to deploy capital into things that are going to drive growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that's when I say, it's a value driver, particularly vis-\u00e0-vis others. It's a huge value driver and that case in particular. So, that's - and yes, it's a 113% funded. I feel great about where that is. Even if we were to have a bit of a market downdraft, we would still be very, very - in very good position in terms of that funding levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to me, it's - the team has done a terrific job of managing the pension and the annual returns around it for a very long time and it has absolutely been very good for us and for our balance sheet and our liquidity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, and Jeff, maybe couple other things to it. There's really only two ways you can sort of monetize. The one way is obviously, if there is no more people in the pension plan anymore, which frankly it's a couple of years from now, that's - the other way you could sell it to potentially insurance company, and so on. But there is a big premium on that, so financially that doesn't make a lot of sense to do that right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think what our investors should really remember is that when they think about pension, particularly given the de-risking that we have and the amount of fixed instruments that we have, this should be completely worry free for them because even a huge adjustment in the stock market is not going put us in parallel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I just think that this is sort of a safe haven in terms of an area that frankly is a big question mark for a lot of companies out there. For us, it's a big positive and is going to stay that way for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Bendza</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steven, let's take one last question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sir. We will take our final question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, I have a little bit of a longer-term question actually on the UOP business. How do you think about that business just in with the backdrop that you've got, EVs are obviously going to become a much bigger portion of the market going forward? There's going to be some biofuel conversion, so how are you thinking about that business kind of structurally more - longer term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamcyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, good question. Good morning. Two-fold, the first one is, the world, obviously, that the world of energy and how energy is generated is going to change over time. And the direction of that is clear. It's going to be renewables, energy is going to become much, much more prevalent part of the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it's also not going to be immediate. It's not going to happen in 2022 or '23 and it's going to be slow gradual progress. So, a lot of the things that UOP still does will become relevant, particularly a big part of that business being around gas, natural gas, which we know is the cleanest of the hydrocarbons. So, that's Phase one. So, I think that we got to continue to serve our customer base. And frankly, many of whom will be transforming in terms of how they provide energy to the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second part, as we've launched a new business within UOP, Sustainability Technology Solutions business, which is going to become a bigger and bigger and bigger part of the UOP portfolio. And it really has three primary growth levers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One is energy storage, which is economically feasible and viable and we're building and deploying our first prototype of that this year. So, it's not a dream. Two is, 360 degree plastics recyclability, which also we're going to be deploying some technology this year. And then last one, where we really are the pioneers, which is Ecofining, which is going to become a bigger, bigger part of that refining footprint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we've got three sort of, this is under one business umbrella and that's going to become our growth engine for the future. So, what I envision happening is potentially longer term, some of the more hydrocarbon-oriented offerings will slowly and I emphasize, very slowly decline, while our Sustainability Technology Solutions business will grow very, very quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That's - that sort of how you see that business evolving. That's where we - this is another place we're investing, put our dollars to work and we're excited about the future and the kind of solutions that we have. And as you know, we don't have better scientist anywhere in our company than in UOP when it comes to material science and I'm quite confident that some of these technology breakthroughs will work and will really enable a path to future energy footprint of the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That's helpful.
