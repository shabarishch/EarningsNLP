We\u2019re excited to be hosting our call this morning from Charlotte, North Carolina, which will officially become our corporate headquarters on August 1. It is an exciting time to be part of the Honeywell team as we continue to transform our business into a premier technology company with Charlotte as our home base. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s begin this morning on Slide 2. It was another very strong quarter for Honeywell. We again delivered on our commitments, generating earnings per share of $2.10 at the high end of our second quarter guidance, up 9% excluding the impact of spinoffs in 2018. This strong earnings result was driven by organic sales growth of 5% and 170 basis points of segment margin expansion. Notably, our segment profit excluding the spins, on a comparable basis to 2018 was up 9% this quarter and was the largest contributor of EPS growth. For the first half of 2019, organic sales growth reached 7%, which is a proof point to the investments we\u2019ve made in our business, in our sales force, and new technologies that are winning in the marketplace. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see the benefits from our strong positions on key platforms in our long cycle business aviation and defense portfolios in aerospace, in our warehouse automation business, which is up over 20% organically year-to-date, and now generates approximately $2 billion in annual sales in our building technologies business, which had another great quarter. Our process solutions and UOP businesses, which principally serve the oil and gas industry, also both grew 5% organically this quarter as we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making in the Honeywell connected enterprise, which drove double-digit organic sales growth of our software in the quarter. In fact, this quarter we signed a framework agreement to deliver Honeywell Forge asset performance management and improve the reliability and performance of over 1,000 industrial assets for a large Middle Eastern refinery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Segment margin exceeded 21% in the second quarter, up 170 basis points driven by smart portfolio enhancements we made in 2018, our investments in the commercial organization, and the benefits of previously funded restructuring to improve our operations. Excluding the favorable margin impact from the spinoffs, segment margin expanded 80 basis points, which was 30 basis points above the high end of our guidance. Building on the progress we have seen for several quarters, we delivered 100% free cash flow conversion and we remain on path to approximately 100% for the second year in a row. I am encouraged by our progress in this area and we remain focused on continuing to drive improvements in working capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also continue to extend our capital deployment strategy, repurchasing $1.9 billion in shares and closing four new Honeywell venture investments in the quarter, bringing our total to 12 new investments in the first two years of the fund. As a result of our first half performance, we are raising the low end of our full-year organic sales guide by one point to a new range of 4% to 6% and raising the low end of our full-year earnings per share guidance to a new range of $7.95 to $8.15. We expect to generate approximately $6 billion in free cash flow for the year, and we have narrowed our free cash flow guidance to reflect this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we are encouraged by our performance this quarter, we are continuing to plan cautiously for the second half of the year given the uncertain macro environment in which we operate. We\u2019ve seen some slowing in certain short cycle businesses that has been overcome by the strong performance in the rest of the portfolio. We think it is prudent to plan conservatively in the event of a broader slowdown, given that nearly 60% of our business is short cycle in nature. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m very pleased by our performance in the first half. We still have substantial work to do to achieve our plan, but I\u2019m confident that the team will continue to execute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll stop there and turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss our second quarter results and updated 2019 guidance in more detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Lewis</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Darius, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin on Slide 3. As Darius highlighted, we delivered on our commitments again in the second quarter, building on the strong start we had in Q1. Organic sales growth and margin expansion performance across the majority of the portfolio was very good. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few highlights to mention - defense and space grew 20% organically and the commercial aftermarket in aerospace grew 8% organically with strong demand across both air transport and business aviation. Building technologies grew 5% organically after 9% in the first quarter, and process solutions and UOP, which encompass our oil and gas portfolio, both grew 5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The impact of the spin-off of Garrett and Resideo, both lower-margin businesses, contributed 90 basis points of segment margin expansion. The remaining 80 basis points was the result of our strong operational performance, primarily in aerospace and performance materials and technologies. We continue to effectively manage the impacts of tariffs through well-executed mitigation efforts and are in the final stages of eliminating all spin-related stranded costs before year end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Notwithstanding our strong performance across most of the portfolio, as we messaged in April and again in May, we did experience challenges in safety and productivity solutions, and more specifically in the productivity products business, which drove a sales and segment margin decline this quarter. I will address that in more detail in a minute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consistent with last quarter, the majority of our earnings growth - $0.16 - came through segment profit improvement. We realized a $0.06 benefit from our share repurchase program which resulted in a weighted average share count of 733 million shares this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 21.5%, largely consistent with the outlook we provided of 22%. Importantly, we were also able to fund a substantial amount of fast payback repositioning in the quarter, more than $80 million, that will support our continued productivity focus, functional transformation, and supply chain initiatives that we discussed at our investor day in May. These proactive measures will be helpful in the event of a slower economy in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.5 billion with conversion of 100%. The strong cash generation was most notable in aerospace and building technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re very pleased with our results and are focused on continuing the strong performance in the second half. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 now to briefly discuss the second quarter EPS bridge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 4 walks our earnings per share from the second quarter of 2018 to the second quarter of 2019. As Darius mentioned, segment profit growth was the main driver for the quarter. That acceleration was most prominent in aerospace and PMT due to a combination of higher organic sales volumes, commercial excellence, and our continued focus on productivity. We also continued to utilize our balance sheet to lower our share count. We deployed nearly $2 billion towards the repurchase of Honeywell shares, consistent with our plan to reduce the share count by at least 1% during the course of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we had a $0.05 headwind on an adjusted basis from below-the-line expenses, primarily due to the proactive restructuring actions I mentioned earlier and lower pension income year over year as a result of the derisking actions we took in 2018 that was partially offset by benefits from net interest expense and foreign exchange. Funding a strong pipeline of future repositioning continues to be a key lever for our productivity playbook and will serve us and our shareholders well as we go forward. The punch line here is we had another high quality quarter, delivering EPS at the high end of our guidance range. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 and we can discuss our segment performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Starting with aerospace, sales were up 11% organically. This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth and capped off an outstanding first half for 2019. Defense and space grew 20% organically led by global demand for guidance and navigation systems as well as increased spares volumes on U.S. DoD programs, including the F-18 and F-22. The defense business is well positioned. More than 50% of firm orders with delivery through 2020 are already booked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In commercial OE, sales were up 4% organically driven by continued strength across the business jet platforms which more than offset declines stemming from the timing of air transport shipments. Notably we saw increased deliveries across all Gulfstream platforms and strong avionics deliveries on certain [indiscernible] platforms. Regarding the Boeing 737 Max situation, we remain aligned to Boeing\u2019s stated production schedule and will continue to monitor the situation closely, but as we stated previously, we do not anticipate a significant impact to Honeywell\u2019s operational results in 2019. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Aftermarket sales were up 8% organically driven by demand across both air transport and business aviation and growth in retrofit, modifications and upgrades, including related to the ADS-B safety mandates. We continue to see good adoption of our connected aircraft technologies which drove strong software sales growth in aerospace and continued to gain traction for our JetWave solution across all aerospace verticals, as demonstrated by the C-17 win we announced in May, our first in the defense business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Aerospace segment margin expanded 330 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes, and margin accretion from the spin of transportation systems. The spin contributed approximately 60 basis points to aero\u2019s total margin expansion. The aero business continues to execute well, investing in future technologies, driving productivity and commercial excellence, and has a healthy long cycle backlog heading into the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><br>In Honeywell building technologies, sales were up 5% organically driven by global demand for commercial fire products. As Vimal Kapur and his team displayed at our investor conference in May, we are innovating and launching new products in this business at a much faster rate than we had in the past, and we continue to see good acceptance from our customers and strong growth as a result. We saw good growth across building management software platforms, including for Tridium, which as you may remember is our platform for integrating building management systems and data using open and proprietary communication protocols. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In building solutions, we drove growth in global projects across the Americas and in the airport vertical in the Middle East. HPT\u2019s segment margins expanded 390 basis points in the second quarter driven by the favorable impact from the spinoff of the homes business. The team continues to make steady progress on our goal to eliminate the remaining stranded costs by year end stemming from the home spin. Segment margins excluding the favorable impact from the spin accretion were roughly flat this quarter, a big improvement from the first quarter, and we continue to make progress on supply chain optimization post the spin. Overall, it was another great quarter for the HPT business with double-digit projects backlog growth in building solutions positioning the business well for the second half of 2019. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In performance materials and technologies, sales were up 4% on an organic basis. Process solutions sales were up 5% organically driven by continued strength in our short cycle businesses, primarily in software, maintenance and migration services, and field instrumentation devices. We also saw growth in smart energy primarily in North America. The short cycle backlog of across process solutions is up over 12%, giving us confidence that the growth in the automation portfolio should continue into the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">UOP sales were up 5% organically driven by growth in licensing and engineering, as well as refining catalysts. We saw particular strength in North America with reinvestment in existing refining infrastructure and select new investments in petrochemicals, and strong backlog conversion in the Middle East. UOP orders and backlog were both up over 10% for the quarter. Additionally, on a year-to-date basis UOP orders in China were up double digits, primarily driven by growth in equipment, licensing and catalysts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Organic sales growth in advanced materials of 2% was driven by demand for our Solstice line of low global warming refrigerants and blowing agents; however, this was partially offset by lower pricing due to the impact of illegal HFC imports in Europe. Enforcement and monitoring of the EU F-gas regulation has been an emerging challenge and we\u2019re working diligently in partnership with other producers, EU regulators, and EU member countries to address the harmful illegal imports. Overall, PMT segment margins expanded by 140 basis points in the second quarter, driven by commercial excellence across all lines of business, direct material productivity, and further improvements in our supply chain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, in safety and productivity solutions, sales were down 4$ on an organic basis in the quarter as segment margins contracted 420 basis points. The weakness we saw this quarter was principally in our short cycle, high margin productivity products business. Similar to the first quarter, we saw a combination of continued distributor inventory destocking, fewer large project rollouts in the mobility space, and lower channel sell-through. The second quarter sales mix in SPS negative impacted our margins as the volume declines we experienced were in more profitable parts of the business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see growth in our sensing and IoT business and robust demand for voice solutions and aftermarket maintenance and services in warehouse automation. As Darius mentioned during last quarter\u2019s earnings release, Intelligrated is beginning to face tougher and tougher comps as we get deeper into the year following five quarters of approximately 20%-plus growth. We are seeing timing of new major system rollouts push into the second half of the year. This effect coupled with tougher sales comps in the second quarter drove flattish sales in Intelligrated in Q2. The large project order push outs we saw in Q2 are consistent with our customers\u2019 latest planning and not an indication of project losses. Intelligrated\u2019s aftermarket business, which enhances customer outcomes through consultative engagements to improve productivity, was up strong double digits organically driven by demand for comprehensive life cycle support and service. The business is benefiting from the large installed base growth in the core Intelligrated portfolio. The outlook for this business overall remains very strong and we delivered organic sales growth of over 20% for the first half of 2019, and we continue to expect this to be a growth business long term. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Within the safety business, organic sales growth was 1%. We saw continued demand for gas detection products, which grew low single digits organically, and retail footwear, which was up high single digits organically. That was largely offset by decreased volumes in general safety and personal protective equipment. In our key end markets for the safety business, we see solid demand of portable gas detection in the U.S. but slower activity in the industrial sector, given distributor inventory levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6 and discuss our third quarter outlook. Our planning assumptions are largely consistent with the second quarter dynamics with some further caution on short cycle. We expect our growth this quarter will be driven by a combination of continued long cycle strength in aerospace and defense coupled with short cycle demand in building technologies and healthy backlog in UOP and process solutions. The aerospace business, as I mentioned, has grown 10% or more organically the past four quarters and we expect continued strong performance due to the order growth rates and backlog in defense. We\u2019ve established a significant backlog of new major system awards for Intelligrated over the past year that will drive growth into 2020 and allow for an expansion of our shorter cycle aftermarket and service businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are taking a cautious view on the short cycle growth as many of the macro signals - the China GDP, U.S.-China trade tensions, and Brexit, just to name a few - are still clouding the economic outlook. We think it\u2019s prudent to plan conservatively given the uncertainties, and our Q3 and second half guidance reflect that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to the sale of weapons to Taiwan by the U.S. government and potential sanctions from China, we see no reason why Honeywell would be potentially sanctioned by the Chinese government and we have received no official word from the Chinese government that Honeywell is on a sanctioned list of entities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s discuss our segment outlook. In aerospace, we continue to see robust demand in both business aviation and in U.S. and international defense, supported by robust orders growth and firm backlogs for orders with delivery into 2020. Air transport shipments should increase sequentially driven by demand for A-350 and A-320 aircraft and lower customer incentives. We will see tougher comparisons in business aviation given the significant organic sales growth in the third quarter of 2018. Consistent with last quarter, we expect that commercial aftermarket activity will be driven by flight hours, airline demand, and further tailwinds from the adoption of safety and compliance mandates, principally in business aviation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In building technologies, we expect good growth with strength primarily in commercial fire products in Americas and EMEA and growth in building management software in high growth regions and for Tridium. On the service side, we expect to see building solutions growth continue given the large order funnel and considerable backlog growth in projects and services. As a reminder, HBT does have significant short cycle exposure particularly in the products vertical, and although we haven\u2019t seen order rates flow, we are planning cautiously here in the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In performance materials and technologies, we expect to see short cycle demand for products and services and process solutions and growth in equipment, absorbents and refining catalysts in UOP. We saw good bookings in equipment and catalysts in the second quarter and growth in the process solutions service bank for new contracts and renewals, which we believe sets PMT up for another good quarter in the third quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, given the challenges we experienced in productivity products and our assumption that the inventory destocking continues for the balance of 2019, we are expecting to see continued headwinds in SPS from both a sales and segment margin perspective, but anticipate that will moderate in the fourth quarter. We expect Intelligrated\u2019s third quarter performance to be similar to Q2 with 20%-plus growth in the aftermarket business but slower large project growth. We maintain a robust backlog of project awards from blue chip customers and see a very strong pipeline of potential awards in the third and fourth quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The net below-the-line impact, which is the difference between segment profit and income before tax, will be minimal this quarter. The difference year-on-year is driven primarily by lower pension income, the benefits from spin indemnification payments partially offset by higher repositioning funding. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s move to Slide 7 to discuss our revised full-year guidance. As Darius noted, e are raising the low end of our full year organic sales, earnings per share, and free cash flow guidance. Our organic sales guidance moves one point in the low end to a new range of 4% to 6%, while our segment margin guidance is unchanged. Our revised earnings per share guidance of $7.95 to $8.15 represents earnings growth of 8% to 10% adjusted, excluding the impact from the spins in 2018. We remain on track to deliver approximately 100% free cash flow conversion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our position on tariffs is unchanged. We expect no significant impact in 2019 given the proactive measures we have taken to mitigate. We also continue to closely monitor the Brexit situation and are communicating regularly with our customers, partners and suppliers. As we stated last quarter, we\u2019re planning for various potential Brexit outcomes, including a no-deal Brexit scenario, to ensure that as the terms of the U.K.\u2019s departure from the EU are finalized, we are well positioned to continue meeting our customers\u2019 needs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our guidance continues to reflect a weighted average share count of 731 million shares and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. Our net below-the-line expenses are now expected to be approximately $120 million in 2019. This reflects slightly higher reposition expense charges partially offset by greater interest income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to be confident in our ability to execute and in our outlook. We\u2019re sticking to the playbook around short cycle caution given the macro uncertainties that remain in the second half of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Darius, who will wrap it up on Slide 8.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Darius Adamczyk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Greg. We are encouraged by the performance from our businesses thus far in 2019. We continue to execute on our commitment to share owners, are generating strong organic growth in many end markets, and have multiple levers to enable further margin expansion. Our operational performance is generating strong free cash flows and conversion while investing in the business to ensure we are well positioned for the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m also encouraged by our progress with the business transformation initiatives we discussed at our investor day, particularly given because of the significant opportunity I see in these areas in the future of Honeywell. Let\u2019s be clear - we have a lot of work to do to execute these initiatives, but I continue to be excited by the energy and enthusiasm I see across the employee population to move the ball forward and truly differentiate Honeywell from our competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, Mark, let\u2019s move to Q&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Macaluso</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Darius. Darius and Greg are now available to answer your questions. April, if you could, please open the line for Q&amp;A.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question is coming from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, good morning everyone. Nice quarter. Obviously, there\u2019s going to be a lot of questions around the short cycle commentary. I heard you guys say cautious a few times during the prepared comments. As I think about your business today and the safety and productivity solutions side, maybe talk a little bit more why you expect the destock to last and what\u2019s really driving that through the fourth quarter. Secondarily, in that business the commentary around new major system rollouts being pushed out, I\u2019m just curious whether you guys are seeing any saturation in that market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s maybe take that in two segments. Number one is we anticipated some level of destocking to occur. I mean, obviously the distributor levels weren\u2019t supported by the level of business, so what we\u2019ve projected for Q3 and Q4 is some level of moderation, but certainly a continuation of the trend in terms of softness in that end market as the destocking continues. Obviously our plans are a bit better than that, but what I don\u2019t want to do is in the short cycle business, I don\u2019t want to be forecasting too aggressively and then end up disappointing, so that\u2019s kind of what we have baked in particularly into the Q3 outlook, which is still negative, and moderating a bit more into Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the things we\u2019re trying to really assess, you know, how much of this is market and how much of this is us. That\u2019s still unclear. From the early indications we had, the market is getting softer; but again until we see all the data points and some of our competitors\u2019 report and piece all that together, we\u2019re really not sure. For now, we\u2019re going to assume it\u2019s us, because I don\u2019t want to just say well, it\u2019s the market so we don\u2019t need to do anything. I can tell you, we have a very aggressive commercial program to address some of these challenges and to drive business at the end user level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The good news here on productivity products is this is not a technology issue. We actually have very good technologies. They\u2019ve been successfully launched, most recently in Q2 around our warehouse business and our TLC, which is our strongest segment, so I\u2019m very encouraged by that. That\u2019s really the story on SPF-- or I should say, on productivity products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of Intelligrated, it\u2019s a very different story. Intelligrated has been growing by strong double digits, like think well north of 20% on average for the last several quarters. What\u2019s happening there is simply some of the orders that we expected in Q2 got pushed out a little bit. They\u2019re still out there, we expect to book them in Q3, Q4. We didn\u2019t lose them - I know that for a fact, and the business is going to continue to grow and we\u2019re very bullish on the business, so there isn\u2019t a greater or a different story here. The business is gaining share, it\u2019s performing extraordinarily well, we see a little bit of a blip in delay in terms of the order bookings, and that\u2019s what we accounted for in our outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would also just add that the aftermarket business, which as you know--you know, capturing the installed base and then going and mining the aftermarket is a big part of that whole thesis, is doing terrific. We\u2019re up over 20% on the LSS business and have been for multi quarters, and as you know, that also carries a higher margin profile so I think that part of the playbook is working nicely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful to hear. Obviously, we\u2019d prefer for you guys to be prudent as your planning assumptions go for the second half of the year. I guess in that vein, you started the year off with roughly 7% organic growth above where your organic guide is for the year, long cycle backlog still plus-10%. What is then the embedded planning assumption for the short cycle businesses? It seems like you\u2019re planning for very, very low growth, if any growth, in short cycle in the second half of the year, and maybe what are some of the puts and takes you\u2019ve got there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well again, Joe, the productivity products one is a big contributor to that, but you\u2019re right - for the remainder of the short cycle businesses, I would say outside of maybe the aerospace aftermarket, we\u2019re planning for low-single digits. Again, as we\u2019ve seen, that can turn very quickly, so we don\u2019t want to get too far out ahead of our skis there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think you have it right, Joe. Think LSD for short cycle, think MSD to maybe even a touch higher for the longer cycle, depending upon the segments, but that\u2019s sort of the rough math. The punch line is we are planning somewhat cautiously for the second half because the geopolitical and the economic movements are pretty volatile right now, and what we try to do is we try to guide that somewhat cautiously based on what we\u2019re seeing today. The short cycle is somewhat unpredictable and can turn very quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Ritchie</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, thanks guys. I\u2019ll let others get on the call. Appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Morning everybody. I think, Greg, you had mentioned that you are taking proactive steps for Brexit, in case there\u2019s a hard Brexit. What exactly does that mean? Does that means you\u2019re sort of stockpiling--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s really about certifications, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s really about certifications and making sure that certified bodies in the EU are going to allow the product flow to continue. So, we\u2019ve been basically recertifying our products with other EU bodies, as opposed to the UK bodies that we have many of our certifications through, and that\u2019s been an ongoing effort. We\u2019re substantially complete at this stage, which is very good, and then we\u2019re just also setting up additional triage in terms of actual movement of goods in the event we need to do anything special or different in terms of air freight or premium freight in that sense to get product to flow. Those are really the two things that the teams have been working most closely on, and you can imagine too when you think about that even from our own internal wiring, there\u2019s systems changes and so on that need to allow those things to be true for us internally as well, so that\u2019s what the teams have been furiously preparing for so that we\u2019re ready no matter which way this goes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How did Europe and China do as regions? I remember China was down a little bit last quarter, obviously given some of the shorter cycle stuff going on there. I think Europe was more resilient. Was there any sort of real change, and change in terms of China and the regional impact, like the Malaysia, Middle East impact? Is there anything else that you would call out there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll take that one, John. I think overall we\u2019re pleased. I\u2019ll highlight a couple of things, for example our PMT bookings in China were around 20% in Q2, so some real strengths. We had some tough comps, think flattish to slightly up for China for Q2, but that\u2019s driven by particularly some of the tough comps that we had in PMT. Overall, obviously there\u2019s some level of concern for the China economy, but overall given the bookings we saw in PMT, that was strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Europe stayed strong, think low to mid single digits for us, some spotty in places. Germany was strong, Italy not so much, but overall really good growth rates for us. Middle East was very, very strong. We\u2019re very encouraged by that. India was up double digits, very strong growth there, LatAm doing well, so for the most part we\u2019re still seeing pretty good growth across the globe. Granted, China maybe wasn\u2019t what it was last year, but also not a complete meltdown and move downwards, so overall we\u2019re still encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing out there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Darius, do you feel that the backlog of restructuring projects that you have would be more than sufficient if the cadence of the global economy continues to soften a little bit, or would you actually be looking to do more projects? Obviously you guys are pretty aggressive in terms of your playbook historically. I\u2019m just--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, well John, I think that\u2019s the highlight--that\u2019s maybe one of the highlights of the quarter. I think we really invested in our future this quarter. We had some very, very attractive restructuring projects, and we wanted to make sure we fund them. We probably could have delivered even higher EPS results in Q2 if we didn\u2019t fund those, but we thought it was prudent, particularly in this level of economic uncertainty, to fund those restructuring projects now, particularly given the kind of pay backs we saw in those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the real answer to your question is I guess it all depends upon how much of an economic hit we would take. We\u2019re kind of protected to the levels we\u2019re forecasting. If those economic cycles are deeper than that, then obviously we\u2019d have to do more, so it\u2019s a bit of a wild ride, as you can see right now, with news items coming every day. But we do what we do all the time, which is we plan cautiously, more productivity, and if the environment is worse than we anticipate, then we\u2019re going to take another round of cost actions to offset those. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, just so you know, the repositioning pipeline is a process just like a sales pipeline or an R&amp;D pipeline. We\u2019re working that at all times so that we are ready when the opportunities present themselves from a funding perspective, and obviously as the economic environment moves, so that\u2019s absolutely part of our routine at all times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Inch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks very much guys, appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Deane Dray</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, good morning everyone. Maybe we can follow up on some of Joe\u2019s beginning questions on the push-outs that you\u2019re seeing. For Intelligrated, the push-outs, are they attributed to anything in particular? Is it macro uncertainty? Do you have any sense of what\u2019s driving the delay in capital commitment? Then similarly, one of your competitors in process has been talking about seeing big project push-outs out of the second quarter into the third and fourth quarter. I\u2019d be interested if you\u2019re seeing some of those dynamics as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019ll start with Intelligrated. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a single cause for that. Some of these projects are fairly substantial from a capital perspective, and there\u2019s timing around board meetings and so on, but we have an indication from our customers that these projects will happen, so I don\u2019t anticipate they\u2019ll result in cancellations. The timing is always unpredictable on large projects. We expect some of those to land in Q3. It wouldn\u2019t shock me if they land in Q4, but they\u2019re not disappearing and they\u2019re not being cancelled. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the large projects, PMT had a pretty good booking quarter overall. It was stronger in UOP than it was in HPS. We\u2019re seeing something somewhat similar on the large projects per se - those are sliding to the right a little bit, but we saw some other strong bookings particularly on the shorter cycle, some of our services business, our advanced solutions, our software businesses, so it\u2019s been a bit of a mixed story when it comes to larger projects, maybe perhaps those are sliding a little bit to the right. But our backlog grew, our bookings were good in PMT, and we anticipate a pretty strong second half of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Deane Dray</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Across the shorter cycle portfolio and the softness that you\u2019re seeing, are you seeing any competitors beginning to use price as a weapon here to drive some volume? Take us through the portfolio and where pricing may have seen some of that pressure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think all short cycle isn\u2019t the same. As we look at HBT, I think our short cycle has actually stayed fairly strong. I think the results speak for themselves, it\u2019s been a really good first half for our HBT business, and we actually are expecting that to continue into Q3. The business is doing very, very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In SPS, it\u2019s the productivity products issue that we talked about earlier. I can\u2019t really necessarily point to price. I mean, as the market is softer, pricing becomes more of a challenge - some of that is definitely true, but I don\u2019t want to point at competition, that this is necessarily any kind of a pricing thing. I mean, yes, there is greater level of competition when markets get softer - that\u2019s true.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we\u2019ve had--I mean, we\u2019re getting price and we\u2019re getting growth still in the short cycle currently, again with the exception of the productivity products story, and then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, in the HFC business, that\u2019s one place where we\u2019re seeing a very specific competitive move going on with some of the illegal imports coming in, into Europe. That\u2019s really the only place that I would highlight as something really visible that we can see competitively. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Deane Dray</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning guys. You guys are putting up pretty predictable numbers each quarter, and it just begs a question, you spent a good chunk of the investor day talking Forge and connectivity and all these interesting things you\u2019re working on, and also the supply chain stuff. Is there any way to measures your progress in these areas, like for example the big margin gains you had this quarter, could you ascribe any of that to supply chain, or is that still out there to come?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, let me start taking this. I think in terms of a lot of our ISC transformation, I can\u2019t--you know, we are in the--we\u2019re not even in the top of the first. We\u2019re grabbing the bat at this juncture, so that\u2019s something that you\u2019re going to see a lot more pronounced really in 2020 and beyond. We\u2019re just getting started, so I\u2019m not going to tell you there\u2019s a lot attributed to the ISC transformation. You probably shouldn\u2019t expect much until 2020 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of Forge and our software play, I think that really the best way to measure that business is growth. That\u2019s the single biggest metric I use and is it profitable growth, and I was very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing - double digit software growth, margin that\u2019s accretive to Honeywell, margin that\u2019s very attractive, and we\u2019re gaining traction, we\u2019re winning jobs. We pointed to a large Middle East win that we had, which is very large in scope, and our customers trust us, so I\u2019m very pleased with the strategic progress we\u2019re making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But our measures are typically financial in nature, because you can make yourself feel good by looking at actions. If you look at financials, and especially for Forge and connected enterprise, ultimately we look at the growth rates and they\u2019ve been double digits, which is good, which was unexpected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and the other thing I guess I would highlight is internally, we\u2019re looking obviously at recurring revenue streams and trying to continue to enhance our recurring revenue streams, so that\u2019s something that as we measure the progress in the connected, that\u2019ll be one that we watch as well pretty closely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, makes sense. I just have a question about Intelligrated and the sales cycle. When you install--when you do the big project, presumably there\u2019s some sort of warranty period. When do you start getting aftermarket from those installs?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s after the completion and turning over the project over to the user, because a lot of times we\u2019ll get the service contract as soon as the job is complete, and granted there are some things that are under warranty, but we\u2019re trying to have the same approach with the Intelligrated business as we do with our HPS business, where we have these longer cycle, the Assurance 360-type of contracts, and we\u2019ve had great traction in that, over 20% growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By the way, I\u2019m not indicating any kind of a slowdown in this business. I don\u2019t think we can expect the 20%-plus growth rates that we\u2019ve seen, but we think that this is going to be a high single digit, double digit growth kind of business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we\u2019ve seen that although the push-outs of the orders, although disappointing, the good news and the fact that our strategy is working is this, which is our services business was up over 20%, it enabled that business to have an accretive margin to what it had last year, and the strategy we\u2019re trying to execute is working. Unfortunately we can\u2019t control the timing of when the orders land, but I can tell you that they\u2019re not due to losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick follow-up on that. At what point does aftermarket become a bigger piece than the install revenues? Is it three years out, five years out?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To be honest, Scott, I hope not for a while, right, because that means that our project cycle is slowing. But you know, it\u2019s a bit of a function that still the projects business is the predominant component in that business, so what would have to occur is the services businesses are already growing at over 20%, the projects business slowed a little bit this past quarter. I actually hope that we get more of the projects, and I think that will happen. I don\u2019t think that this is now the sign of, oh God, the warehouse automation segment is slowing. I think that this could be a blip for a quarter or two and it will resume, but that\u2019s really kind of how things will work, is ultimately the projects business will slow down - I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily now - and the LSS is going to become a bigger growth component of the business. We kind of saw a little bit of a preview of that in Q2, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long term trend yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Good luck, thank you guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, good morning. Just so we\u2019re all on the same page here on the SPS thing, how should we think about the absolute profit for the third quarter, and then I know you guided to something like a $1.1 billion or something like that for the year, are we kind of just south of a billion for the year now when it comes to profitability? Then just as a follow-up, a pretty big miss - you guys were out at EPG not too late, but late May. Did something change significantly in June, or was this something that you knew about but there was enough offset in the rest of the portfolio that you didn\u2019t feel the need to call it out?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steve, let me start with the second comment and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg. In terms of SPS and more specifically productivity products, I think we called it out both in our Q1 earnings reports and John talked about it at our investor day. I think that we were pretty clear that this is going to be another quarter where we\u2019re going to see destocking and some challenges on commercial, so I think that--you know, was this a little bit greater than we anticipated? Yes. Did we signal it? I think we did, and maybe specifically didn\u2019t talk about it at EPG but we certainly did at our Q1 earnings call, and John talked about it specifically at investor day. I\u2019m not sure that we\u2019re shocked by what we saw. Like I said, it\u2019s a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated, but not totally out of whack with our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, then on the profitability front, Steve, I think given the mix of sales that we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter, I think it\u2019s going to look fairly similar in Q3, so I would expect margin rates to be in that same range of 11%, 12% type margins in the third quarter. Fourth quarter should get a little bit better, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it as we exit the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so 225 to 250 in the fourth quarter, something to that extent on segment profit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the margin rates are going to be in that--again, similar range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. One last quick one. When you guys talk about short cycle, to me when I look at the results - you know, commercial, aftermarket, and some of the shorter cycle stuff in PMT, building technology is perfectly fine, you\u2019re really--you\u2019re not necessarily talking about all short cycle. It seems like it\u2019s an SPS type of dynamic, and how bad was the scanning and mobility side, the stuff that you compete with Zebra on? How negative was that in the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think that\u2019s right, Steve - this story is really about productivity products. That was what we signalled, a little bit worse than we thought, it wasn\u2019t a good outcome, and it was down for the quarter, so it was a little bit down, more down than we thought. Some of that is--you know, my guess, although I want to emphasize I don\u2019t know yet, because I always assume it\u2019s our issue, not a market issue, I think there was obviously some issues in the market and market slowing. We\u2019ve had some early data points which would indicate that and some commercial execution things that we need to fix, as well as really the destocking thing was the biggest factor. Frankly, the inventory levels really exiting 2018 are unsupported by the business levels, and some of our distributors are taking actions to do that. So that\u2019s really kind of the negative story. You\u2019re right - it\u2019s not widespread, it\u2019s predominantly limited to one business which didn\u2019t have a great Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Tusa</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and that\u2019s why you guys planned conservatively for the second half.

The second question was if you could just give some color about the M&amp;A pipeline and whether you\u2019re seeing anything attractive. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. You\u2019re right - $1.9 billion was a fairly healthy amount of repo in the quarter. I think we\u2019re about $2.6 billion on a year-to-date basis, and all of that is still aiming at getting the 1% reduction from year to year, so $4 billion for the year is probably in the right neighborhood of where we\u2019ll land. Obviously some of that depends on the share price performance for the remainder of the year, but I think that\u2019s a reasonable assessment of what the end of the year will look like.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then as it relates to the M&amp;A pipeline, we continue to be active. I wouldn\u2019t say we have--you know, other quarters, we\u2019ve come in and talked about having things that were right at the one yard line that didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t think we had anything that was quite that close in this particular quarter, but we continue to be very active across all four of the businesses, and then as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re ramping up the activity particularly in HPT, given the fact that that business is now on much firmer footing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gautum Khanna</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks. If I can squeeze one more in here, what are the demand trend expectations for PMT in the second half? What sort of growth are you looking at for those--for UOP, HBS and advanced materials?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Think about that as mid single digits. Again, with the backlogs that we have entering the back half of the year, we think mid single digits is a very reasonable spot for PMT. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gautum Khanna</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from Jeffery Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, good morning everyone. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on SPS for good reason, but let\u2019s talk aero for a moment. The margins were extraordinarily strong there, stronger than I might have guessed given the mix. I know you\u2019ve got some commercial-like margins in part of your defense and space business, but can you give us a little bit more color on what really played out in the margins in the quarter and how you see the rest of the year playing out there? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think that margin growth is really a testament to the execution prowess of the aerospace team and a lot of our strategies are working. I think sometimes we forget that our software business isn\u2019t just in Honeywell connected enterprise, it\u2019s also in our avionics franchise, and that group has done a tremendous job in really shifting its focus through RMUs and upgrades and enhancements, and we saw the benefits in that because it obviously has accretive margin rates. They\u2019ve done a great job at driving productivity in the business, so although--you know, this is that ultimate combination we also want to see, which is you drive productivity while getting good growth and you really expand the margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously focus on the connected enterprise and connected aircraft is helping margins as well, good growth on spares. The BGA market is very, very strong right now, both in terms of OE and aftermarket. It\u2019s a testament to a lot of the great wins we\u2019ve had on the platforms, but also supporting our customers in flight. And then lastly but certainly importantly, defense and space has just been on fire and just about any segment to want to look, we\u2019ve been there, whether it\u2019s helos, whether it\u2019s the U.S., international defense, all those segments are doing well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think this is really an important fact, Jeff, that as we look from now through the end of 2020, end of 2020 we have more than 50% of the business already booked, so we\u2019re really in really nice shape as we look into the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Sprague </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks for that. Just back to this China question, I fully understand your position and statement this week as it relates to this. I wonder if you have seen or how you would keep an eye out for maybe more subtle pressures, not only on your but obviously your--you would see it in your own business, but any indication that U.S. or western companies are just getting a little bit of the cold shoulder around the edges, or any other kind of behavior change in the business that you\u2019ve picked up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I don\u2019t. I think as Greg pointed out, I know we\u2019ve received interesting press on this subject, but we have seen no indication from China authorities that there are any sanctions coming our way. We have received no sanction. I think I\u2019ll point to a couple of things. Number one is we received our first Jetway order in China, which is very promising. I mentioned the PMT bookings in China were very, very strong in Q2. China is an important market for us, we play it locally, we have a lot of manufacturing, a lot of R&amp;D facilities in China, it\u2019s a market that we take great pride in serving local for local, and we expect that to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Sprague</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Thank you. Maybe just a first question around overall cadence of demand in recent months. Your organic sales growth was 8% in Q1, it\u2019s guided at the midpoint at 3% in Q3, so a pretty severe slowdown with comps that are not that different. Aside from what you\u2019ve talked about in SPS, have you seen any changes in demand in recent months? Several companies talked about June being materially worse than the rest of Q2. Just wondered what you\u2019d seen recently in that respect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Julian, it\u2019s Greg. We haven\u2019t seen any really clear patterns like that across the portfolio that would cause us to say that June is the beginning of a huge slowdown, so across the portfolio I would say the answer is no. But as Darius mentioned earlier, the portfolio is not one thing, and so I expect that we\u2019re going to see different dynamics across the different parts of the portfolio and across different parts of the globe. Darius talked about the strength in Europe earlier, and there\u2019s a lot of strength there because the aerospace business is doing particularly well, and as long as flight hours stay strong we expect to see Europe continuing to do well there. The dynamics in China, as we mentioned, are strong on the long cycle side with UOP orders, so we\u2019ve got a very strong backlog in PMT in the short cycle businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So far, the answer, no real pattern down, but it\u2019s something we absolutely watch as you would expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and just to maybe add to that, actually if you look at June on a year-over-year organic growth basis, it was our best month. Now granted we saw some softness in SPS which was pronounced, and that\u2019s why we have a bit more of a cautious guide for Q3. That\u2019s really the reason, is we\u2019re not expecting a miraculous turnaround in SPS in Q3. Some of the softness we saw in June, we actually anticipate may continue and that\u2019s why you see our guide, but overall if you look at total Honeywell organic, June on a year-over-year basis was actually our best month of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you for that detail. Maybe just picking up on your last point, Darius, within SPS, the warehouse and workflow solutions piece, revenue growth there was 7% in Q2 after 50% growth in Q1. What should we expect in the second half in terms of warehouse and workflow solutions sales trends specifically? Do you expect to pick up from Q2 as some of those orders get realized, or you\u2019re leaving it as sort of a single digit growth assumption for now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you\u2019re referring to productivity products, which I think there\u2019s kind of two different components, we don\u2019t expect a major turnaround here in Q3. Like I said, we still expect that to be negative for Q3 and some level of moderation in Q4. As it comes to Intelligrated, we\u2019re still expecting high single digit, double digit growth for the year. Q3 is a little bit dependent upon exactly when we land some of the orders, but think about--you know, we\u2019re now getting into the tougher and tougher comps, so we\u2019re thinking about single digit kind of growth rates for the second half. But again, just to be clear, that\u2019s depending upon when those orders come, because we\u2019re ready to execute those and we have every indication that they\u2019ll land. Obviously getting those sooner in Q3 would be better; getting them later or pushed out to Q4 would be worse, and that\u2019s a little bit tough to predict, but I\u2019m very bullish on our ability to secure those orders when they do land. That, I\u2019m not that concerned about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The final question is from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning guys. Just a couple of, I guess, more clean-ups than anything else. I think we\u2019ve beaten SPS to death, so hopefully John can take the rest of the day off. On aerospace specifically, clearly commercial air aftermarket doing very well. I want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing unsustainable there particularly as it pertains the Max grounding, maybe with some of these older aircraft filling the schedule that aftermarket gets a little bit of boost and we shouldn\u2019t expect all of that to continue. I know the trend line is good, I just didn\u2019t\u2019 know if there was a little extra that you got out of the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I would say this - there is probably a little bit of that, where you had more older aircraft flying vis-\u00e0-vis, but that\u2019s not going to have the kind of dramatic impact on our results. I wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s really the cause and effect. I think as long as the air miles stay strong, as long as the economy stays in reasonable shape and people continue to fly business aircraft and buy business aircraft. Defense and space business - like I said, we\u2019re already more than half booked for the next 18 months. Things can always change, but overall we\u2019re not--this is not an area where we\u2019re concerned. We should have very good visibility to Q3 and Q4. Obviously this is a long cycle business. Short cycle continues to look strong, so overall I don\u2019t think that this is some kind of a blip or unusual event here in Q2. I think this is evidence that our strategies are working the aero team is executing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Then just back on the topic of inventory, I know that that\u2019s clearly driving some of the activity in SPS, but as you look back on maybe the second half of \u201918, are there any businesses that now with the benefit of hindsight you can say, maybe we saw distributors take on more inventory than perhaps they were selling through and it\u2019s something we\u2019re watching a channel here and there, that you can share with us or we should keep in mind as we go into the second half? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Darius Adamczyk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Like you said, hindsight is always 20/20. I think the distributors to some extent play the same role we do, is they want to be prepared for good markets and they want to be prepared to sell out product, so could you say that they took on a bit more inventory than they should have? Well, yes. Hindsight, that\u2019s clearly the case. Yes, you\u2019re right - we are watching days of inventory, we are bringing that down. It came up out Q1, it came down in Q2, we\u2019re planning to have it again come down in Q3 and get it to a much more lower level. That\u2019s really the--you know, if we want to focus around the negative punch line of the quarter, and overall I think this was a very strong quarter for Honeywell, but if we want to focus on the negative, which is fair, that\u2019s really the punch line. We\u2019ve got to get those inventory levels moderated to levels that our distributors are comfortable with, and we planned that for the first half, we\u2019ve got a little bit more to do in Q3, and we\u2019ll see around Q4. Obviously the variable we don\u2019t know is sales out, because if that goes up, then we have leftover product; if it goes down, we\u2019ll have more work to do. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So short answer is yes, we\u2019re monitoring it and we\u2019re going to be very closely watching it here for--well, forever, but certainly for the second half of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Pokrzywinski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darius Adamczyk for any additional closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Darius Adamczyk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to thank our share owners for their trust and support of Honeywell. We have made great strides in 2019 but we still have a long runway to continue our progress. We are focused on continuing to outperform for our share owners, our customers, and our employees. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter marks the start of a new era for Honeywell in Charlotte, North Carolina and I could not be more excited about what lies ahead for this company. Thank you all for listening, and have a wonderful, relaxing and safe rest of the summer. Take care, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.
