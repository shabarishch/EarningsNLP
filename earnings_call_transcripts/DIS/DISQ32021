[Operator Instructions]</p> <p>I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Lowell Singer</strong></p> <p>Good afternoon, and it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome everyone to The Walt Disney Company\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings call.</p> <p>Our press release was issued about 25 minutes ago and is available on our website at www.disney.com/investors. Today\u2019s call is also being webcast and we will post a transcript of this call to our website.</p> <p>Joining me remotely today are Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Christine McCarthy, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following comments from Bob and Christine, we of course will be happy to take some of your questions.</p> <p>So, with that, let me turn the call over to Bob to get started.</p> <p><strong>Bob Chapek</strong></p> <p>Thanks, Lowell, and hello, everyone.</p> <p>Today, I\u2019d like to start off by talking about our Company\u2019s priorities for the future. As has been the case for Disney\u2019s nearly 100-year history, it all begins with great storytelling, which is the foundation of our special<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> connection to audiences and guests. And our foremost priority will continue to be to tell the world\u2019s most original and enduring stories brought to life by the world\u2019s most talented creators.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">As home to some of the most beloved franchises, we will maximize the synergy of our<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> unique ecosystem to further deepen consumers\u2019 connection to our characters and stories. And we will use the power of our far-reaching platforms and emerging technologies to better anticipate what our consumers want and deliver them a more seamless and more personalized entertainment experience.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are executing against these priorities, and results clearly speak for themselves. Looking across the Company over the past quarter, we are pleased with the trajectory we are on as we continue to grow our businesses, despite the challenges presented by the ongoing everchanging COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the third fiscal quarter in a strong position, with adjusted EPS up tenfold to $0.80 compared to $0.08 last year. At our Parks, Experiences and Products business, we\u2019re encouraged by some of the positive trends we\u2019re seeing, and new developments we have been hard at work on, including the brand-new Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure, where guests can team up with their favorite superheroes in thrilling ways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At our international parks, Shanghai is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year with great fanfare, and we welcome the first guests to our reimagined Marvel themed hotel at Disneyland Paris.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Meanwhile, work continues on a wide array of new experiences, including the one-of-a-kind Star Wars themed Galactic Starcruiser at Walt Disney World. And as part of a multiyear transformation of EPCOT, we\u2019ll soon introduce our extraordinary new nighttime spectacular Harmonious.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last month, we completed our first cruise since the start of the pandemic with the Disney Magic, which is currently sailing short-term staycations for UK residents. And the Disney Dream set sail on its first U.S.-based cruise this week. Future bookings for all of our ships remain strong, with bookings in the third quarter in particular, having benefited from the announcement of our fall 2022 itineraries and the successful marketing launch of our fifth ship, the Disney Wish, which will set sail in summer of 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As our parks business continues its recovery and we see demand grow, we are now putting into action some of the amazing guest-centric services that we have been developing over the last few years. These include Magic Key, our recently announced new annual pass membership program at Disneyland. It provides great value and a variety of options for our guests, and will be available starting on August 25th. The reaction to the news from fans has been extremely positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, we\u2019ve made significant investments in sophisticated technology and tools, creating a revolutionary new multi-tiered service, we\u2019re calling Disney Genie, that will enable our guests to more easily and efficiently navigate everything our parks have to offer. We\u2019re very, very excited about this new service, and we\u2019ll be providing additional detail soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The goal of Disney Genie, which will appear in a user-friendly app, is to create a better, more personalized and customized experience for guests, putting them in control and providing even greater flexibility and choice. They\u2019ll be able to spend less time waiting in line and figuring out what attractions or dining options are available, and more time having fun.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the direct-to-consumer side, we are extremely pleased with the continuing success of our portfolio of streaming services. Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu have performed incredibly well with 116 million 14.9 million and 42.8 million subscribers, respectively, for a total of nearly 174 million subscriptions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Numerous breakout hits from our beloved brands, including Pixar\u2019s Luca and Marvel\u2019s Loki and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier have contributed to strong engagement and new subscriber growth in core Disney+ markets. And we have continued to launch Disney+ in new markets around the world, including Disney+ Hotstar in Malaysia and Thailand in Q3. Disney+ is also currently available in a limited capacity in Japan and will expand to the full market in late October, followed by additional APAC markets, including South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in mid-November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The launch of Disney+ in Eastern Europe has moved from late 2021 to summer of 2022, primarily to allow for an expanded footprint that will include parts of the Middle East and South Africa. Additionally, we\u2019re excited about the launch of Star+ throughout Latin America later this month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we\u2019ve said, our direct-to-consumer business is the Company\u2019s top priority. And among our unique advantages in promoting and growing our DTC service are our powerhouse brands and the vast array of direct consumer touch points we have across our businesses, from our media networks to our theme parks to our consumer products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This synergy enables us to raise consumer awareness and further increase engagement with our streaming services. And the power of this synergy will be on full display on November 12 when we celebrate Disney+ Day with an unprecedented Company-wide cross-promotional campaign. Our robust pipeline of content continues to fuel growth, and we have an incredible lineup of new programming for Disney+.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Thanksgiving Day, we are thrilled to be premiering the first of Peter Jackson\u2019s highly anticipated six-episode Beatles documentary, Get Back. We also have exciting new series from Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic coming later this year, including Marvel\u2019s Hawkeye, starring Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld; The Mandalorian Spin-Off, The Book of Boba Fett and National Geographic\u2019s, Welcome to Earth with Will Smith.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to our current approach to distributing our feature-length films, last year, in light of the prolonged and unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we needed to find alternative ways to bring our movies to consumers while theaters were closed. And once they began to reopen, there was still widespread reluctance to return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Therefore, we adopted a three-pronged strategy for releasing our films that consisted of theatrical releases, direct to Disney+ and a hybrid of theatrical plus premier access as we did with Cruella, Jungle Cruise and Marvel\u2019s Black Widow, the top-performing film at the domestic box office since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Both, Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience. And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a phone by phone basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release and innovate accordingly, while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have an incredible slate of upcoming theatrical films, starting with Free Guy which premiers tomorrow, followed by Marvel\u2019s newest action adventure, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings on September 3rd. The highly anticipated live-action musical, West Side Story from Steven Spielberg, is set for December as is the Kingsman, a prequel in the popular Kingsman series. We have Disney Animation Studios\u2019 Encanto, an incredibly heartwarming story set into magical town in Colombia and featuring music by the incomparable Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Marvel slate includes four feature films in fiscal 2022, the all-new Eternals, alongside sequels to Doctor Strange, Thor and Black Panther. A brand new Indiana Jones Adventure starring Harrison Ford, is due in the summer, as is the origin story of another Intrepid Explorer in Lightyear, a spin-off of the beloved Toy Story franchise. It\u2019s a widely appealing slate with something for everybody.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our goal is always to provide guests and consumers with unparalleled entertainment, whether they\u2019re visiting one of our parks or watching one of our films in a theater or on our streaming platforms. And as we continue our recovery, we believe we are taking the right steps to further this goal while growing our businesses and increasing shareholder value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Personally, I am as optimistic as ever about the future of our Company. We have a robust and growing portfolio of DTC services powered by the world\u2019s best storytellers and greatest brands and franchises, and the parks business, which extend those stories and creates a place where magic comes to life in a more guest-friendly way than ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Christine and she\u2019ll talk in greater detail about the quarter and the way ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Christine McCarthy</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding certain items, diluted earnings per share for the third fiscal quarter was $0.80, an increase of $0.72 from the prior year quarter. I\u2019ll walk through our results today by segment, starting with Parks, Experiences and Products where we continued to benefit from improvements and recovery at our parks and resorts as well as at consumer products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Segment operating income at DPEP in Q3 increased by $2.2 billion year-over-year. At parks and experiences, we continued to benefit in the third quarter from the reopening of our sites around the world. Walt Disney World Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort were both open for the entire third quarter. Whereas in the prior year quarter, Walt Disney World was closed for the entire quarter, and Shanghai Disney was open for 48 days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland Paris were open for 72 days and 19 days, respectively, in the third quarter versus 10 days and zero days in the prior year quarter. And Disneyland Resort was opened for 65 days during the third quarter and was closed for all of the prior year quarter. At Walt Disney World, third quarter attendance levels were generally at or near our daily capacity levels, which increased throughout the quarter. Disneyland Resort also steadily increased attendance and capacity following its reopening at the end of April and particularly after the lifting of California state restrictions on June 15th.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Guest spending at our domestic parks has been exceptionally strong, with third quarter per cap up significantly versus fiscal 2019 at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Guest spend has benefited from pent-up demand and favorable guest mix, driving higher admissions per cap as well as from spending on products related to Star Wars, Galaxy\u2019s Edge and Avengers Campus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking forward, theme park reservations at both of our domestic parks remain strong, and we continue to utilize our yield management strategy to deliver the optimal guest experience and provide flexibility to our guests during these dynamic times, all while driving economic margin for our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At consumer products, improved results year-over-year were driven by growth at both our merchandise licensing and retail businesses. Growth in merchandise licensing was primarily due to higher revenue from merchandise, based on several of our key franchises, including Mickey and Minnie, Star Wars, including the Mandalorian, Disney Princess and Spider-Man. The increase in retail was due to higher results at Disney stores, most of which were closed in the prior year quarter as well as a comparison to the impairment of store assets in the prior year quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to our Media and Entertainment Distribution segment. Third quarter operating income decreased by about $1 billion versus the prior year as improved results at direct-to-consumer were offset by declines at Linear Networks and Content Sales/Licensing and Other. At Linear Networks, operating results were lower at both, our domestic and international channels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At domestic channels, both cable and broadcasting operating income decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year. The decrease in operating income at cable was due to higher programming and production costs and higher marketing costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. As we called out last quarter, the increase in Q3 programming and production costs was due to the return of live sports at ESPN, driven by the NBA and Major League Baseball.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the prior year quarter, a significant number of live sporting events were canceled or delayed due to COVID-19. At broadcasting, lower results from the ABC television network were only partially offset by growth at our owned television stations. The decrease at ABC was largely due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising and affiliate revenue. The increase in programming and production costs was due to an increase in the average cost of programming and the shift in timing of the Academy Awards, which aired in the third quarter compared to the second quarter in the prior fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Domestic advertising revenue increased year-over-year at both, cable and broadcasting, driven by favorable comparisons versus the prior year due to COVID-19. At cable, the increase was driven by ESPN, where third quarter advertising revenue increased by $400 million versus the prior year, reflecting the return of live sporting events.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Q4-to-date, domestic cash advertising revenue at ESPN is currently pacing above prior year. But bear in mind that this comparison is complicated by various COVID and timing impacts from the prior year. We\u2019re not going to provide a forecast for the quarter, but the underlying sports ad marketplace remains strong for us, particularly in the quarter in which the Olympics were held.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At broadcasting, higher advertising results were primarily driven by increased rates and the timing of the Academy Awards, which benefited both, the owned television stations and ABC. Total domestic affiliate revenue increased 4% in the quarter. This was driven by a benefit of 8 points of growth from higher rates, offset by a 3-point decline due to a decrease in subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Results at international channels declined due to higher programming and production costs, partially offset by higher advertising revenue. Both of these factors were impacted by the return of live sporting events and in particular, the Indian Premier League, which held cricket matches from April 9th until the season was postponed on May 4th versus no matches in the prior year quarter due to COVID-19.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Direct-to-Consumer. Q3 operating income improved by over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by Hulu, partially offset by a higher loss at Disney+. The increase at Hulu was due to growth in subscription and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming costs related to Hulu Live. Hulu ended the third quarter with 42.8 million paid subscribers, up from 41.6 million in Q2, inclusive of the Hulu Live digital MVPD service. Paid subscribers to Hulu Live decreased slightly to 3.7 million from 3.8 million at the end of Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Disney+, operating results decreased versus the prior year due to higher programming and production, marketing and technology costs, driven by the ongoing expansion of the service. These higher costs were partially offset by increased subscription revenue, reflecting subscriber growth and increases in retail pricing as well as Premier Access revenue for Cruella. Note that Disney+ Premier Access revenue is included in our DTC operating results but is excluded for the purposes of calculating ARPU.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Bob mentioned earlier, we ended the third quarter with 116 million global paid subscribers to Disney+, up from approximately $104 million in the second quarter. Disney+ Hotstar accounted for the majority of our net subscriber additions between Q2 and Q3, making up a little less than 40% of our total Disney+ subscriber base as of the end of the third quarter. However, subscriber growth was also solid at our core Disney+ markets, excluding Disney+ Hotstar, with total quarter-over-quarter net adds in those markets consistent with net adds from Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Disney+\u2019s overall ARPU this quarter was $4.16. Excluding Disney+ Hotstar, it was $6.12 or an increase of about $0.50 versus the second quarter, reflecting a benefit from the recent price increases, both domestically and abroad. Disney+ Hotstar ARPU also increased from Q2 to Q3 due to higher ad revenue per subscriber, reflecting the roughly four weeks of IPL matches that were played in Q3 versus none in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At ESPN+, operating results in the quarter were comparable versus the prior year. ESPN+ ended Q3 with 14.9 million paid subscribers, reflecting over 1 million net subscriber additions versus the second quarter. Content Sales/Licensing and Other operating income at DMED decreased in the third quarter versus the prior year due to lower home entertainment and theatrical distribution results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The decrease in home entertainment results was due to lower unit sales of new release titles, reflecting the performance of Raya and the Last Dragon and Soul in the third quarter compared to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Frozen II, Onward, Call of the Wild, and Ford v. Ferrari in the prior year quarter, along with lower catalog sales. The decrease in theatrical distribution results was primarily due to higher marketing expense for future releases and lower operating income from titles in release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking ahead, there are a handful of items I would like to mention, as you think about our fourth quarter. At Linear Networks, we expect fourth quarter operating income to decline versus the prior year, reflecting incremental marketing and programming costs at ABC and FX, in addition to an adverse comparison to last year\u2019s benefit from the 53rd week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The increase in marketing and programming expenses at ABC and FX is driven by more than twofold increase in the number of series premieres versus the prior year quarter as productions in the prior year were impacted by COVID. As it relates to the 53rd week, recall that last year, we estimated a benefit of approximately $200 million to the Company, which primarily impacted our Linear Networks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Content Sales/Licensing and Other, we are expecting an operating loss in the fourth quarter, driven by a number of items, including higher marketing and distribution costs in the theatrical window due to more titles being released versus the prior year, in addition to lower results from home entertainment and third-party content licensing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be approximately $200 million lower than our fiscal 2020 CapEx of $4 billion due to lower spending at our domestic parks and resorts, partially offset by increased spending for facilities across the enterprise and technology for our DTC services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And finally, in light of the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our continued prioritization of investments that support our growth initiatives, the Board decided not to declare or pay a dividend for the first half of fiscal 2021. Longer term, we do anticipate that both, dividends and share repurchases will remain a part of our capital allocation strategy. However, for the time being, we don\u2019t anticipate declaring a dividend or repurchasing shares until we return to a more normalized operating environment and our leverage is back to levels more consistent with a single A credit rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Lowell, and we would be happy to take your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lowell Singer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Christine. And once again, as we transition to the Q&amp;A, let me note that since we are not physically together this afternoon, I will do my best to moderate the Q&amp;A by directing your questions to the appropriate executive. And with that, we are ready for the first question.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Nathanson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Lowell, I\u2019ll let you choose the speakers, but here are the questions. One is, I wanted to understand how the Company is thinking about near-term theatrical releases, given the steep fall-off in second week box, rise of the Delta variant, international markets still not opened. So why not delay or pause release schedule?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, secondly, on DTC profits, I guess, more Hulu profits, it looks like continually they\u2019re getting better than expected. I think you turned profitable this quarter with Hulu. So, I\u2019m wondering why that improvement and why not revisit maybe some of the guidance that we shared earlier on DTC profitability, just given the continual improvement in it looks like Hulu profitability? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Michael, thank you for those questions. I\u2019ll turn the first one over to Bob and then Christine can address the Hulu profitability question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Michael, as you probably recognize, we live in a very uncertain world in terms of the recovery of some of our markets in the theatrical exhibition world. It\u2019s certainly part of that. We\u2019ve said from the very beginning that we value flexibility in being able to make as last-minute calls as we can, given what we see in the marketplace. And certainly, when we planned our schedule that we\u2019re executing right now, we did not anticipate, nor did I think anybody, the resurgence of COVID with the Delta variant that would have such a significant impact on the marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the same time, when you work in an ecosystem, having a lot of partners, they need to be able to plan their business, too. And so, at some point, we have to put a stake in the ground and say, for example, Shang-Chi, that\u2019s going to be a title that we\u2019re going to put in the marketplace or Free Guy, that\u2019s going to be a title that we\u2019re going to put into the marketplace. Not knowing, again, three months earlier when you make that commitment, what exactly the marketplace is going to look like. But, what I do think that says, Michael, it says that we value flexibility and we value to follow where the consumer is going to go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And while some of that\u2019s uncertain, I think, in terms of relative to where the rest of the market is, you see that we\u2019ve got more flexibility in terms of how we program. And nothing is in stone because the marketplace is rapidly changing. But at some point, you\u2019ve got to put a stake in the ground and say, this is what we\u2019re going to do. And that\u2019s where we ended up on Shang-Chi and Free Guy, which are our next two titles out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Nathanson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bob, can I just follow-up? Why wouldn\u2019t you just add from your access, given what you saw happen, I think, successfully with Black Widow to those two titles?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Good questions. On Free Guy, obviously, this is a title that we acquired under a different distribution assumption and set of agreements. So, we don\u2019t have the degree of freedom to do that on Free Guy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Shang-Chi, we think it\u2019s actually going to be an interesting experiment for us because it\u2019s got only a 45-day window for us. So, the prospect of being able to take a Marvel title to the service after going theatrical with 45 days will be yet another data point to inform our actions going forward on our titles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But once again, I\u2019ll refer back to my previous answer. When we planned Shang-Chi, that title was planned on being in a much more healthy theatrical environment. And at this point, unfortunately, due to distribution agreements that we have and due to just the practicalities of last-minute changes, it wouldn\u2019t be possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Nathanson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll take your question on Hulu, Michael. You\u2019re absolutely correct. Hulu exceeded our expectations, and it was profitable this quarter. There\u2019s a couple of things going on here. One is, it has had -- continued to have subscriber growth and also very strong advertising revenue. The advertising is coming from higher sell-through rates, a lot of addressable advertising and a significant ramp-up in the dynamic ad insertion technology that we have within Hulu Live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, those are things that are driving it. And at the same time, they are just like all of our other streaming services, they\u2019re ramping up their production, programming and also marketing expense to promote those new shows. So, we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s going on at Hulu, but we\u2019re not going to update our guidance yet because we are in the process of doing our fiscal \u201822 annual operating plan. And if we feel that we have to update it after we complete that, we will certainly do it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Nathanson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Michael, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alexia Quadrani</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My questions are on the parks side, if I can. I guess, the first one is, we\u2019ve seen really, really much improved results this quarter. And moving forward, I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing any recent impact from the Delta variant in the domestic or international parks may be cause for concern, particularly as you\u2019re increasing capacity. And then, just staying on the parks, maybe you can elaborate on how we should view sort of longer-term profitability, given the improvements you\u2019re able to make in terms of automating many aspects of the parks during COVID or while they were closed. But now, maybe with heightened cleaning expenses perhaps staying for a while and other expenses related to COVID staying for a while, given how this variant has continued to kind of make COVID still very much part of our lifestyle. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Alexia, thanks for the question. So Bob, maybe you talk about Delta\u2019s impact on parks and you may want to talk about leading in Alexia\u2019s second question, some of the yield stuff we\u2019ve been doing. And Christine, you probably want to follow-up on the second part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. In terms of impact of the Delta variant, we see strong demand for our parks continuing. And the primary noise that we\u2019re seeing right now are really around group or convention cancellations. In other words, large groups that are coming in relatively short-term. But on the whole, we see really strong demand for our parks. In fact, our park reservations now are above our Q3 attendance levels. And as you just saw with our earnings announcement, our Q3 attendance levels were pretty darn good. So, we\u2019re still bullish about our park business going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I may also suggest, as a bridge to the second question that we\u2019ve implemented a reservation system that\u2019s going to enable us to spread our demand, increase our yield and improve our guest experience at the same time. And in terms of the long-lasting impacts that you mentioned, I think some of the cost implications that we need to do for hygienic purposes are going to be relatively short-lived.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And frankly, in the grand scheme of operating our parks, not all that material. But what will be the long-lasting impact is the improvements that we\u2019re making with guest personalization and guest choice, therefore, affecting the tremendous yield benefits that we\u2019ve been able to extract over the last few quarters. And that\u2019s only going to grow in the future with our ability to really do world-class yield management systems through our new reservation system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi Alexia. And I\u2019d add to that a couple of things. One is, we have seen very, very strong per caps in addition to all the yield management things Bob mentioned. But the per caps, in my comments, I referred to them as exceptionally strong. And I would not use that word were it not for the fact that they were exceptional. Last quarter, I said that they were up strong double-digit and this quarter was even stronger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look at - when a park is closed for a long period of time, as Disneyland was, as Paris was, when they reopen, the per caps really shoot up. And we still have, even though Walt Disney World isn\u2019t open now for over a year, we\u2019re still seeing extremely strong per cap growth continue at that park.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in addition to all the technology things that we\u2019re implementing, as Bob mentioned, reservation systems, the dining apps, we\u2019re just seeing the consumer behavior be very favorable. And the guest experience is something that we\u2019re going to be focused on, especially as we continue to reopen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Alexia Quadrani</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alexia, thanks for the questions today. Operator, next question, please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ben Swinburne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple probably for Christine. Christine, I was wondering if you could give us the Hulu advertising growth in the quarter. I think, you\u2019ve given that to us in prior quarters. And then, also, just are you expecting the IPL to come back in September at this point? And any update on the Latin American sports situation, since that\u2019s part of your launch there. And then, if I can ask Bob a parks question just on technology. You mentioned the Disney Genie. How substantial of a sort of an improvement or evolution in the guest experience are you expecting to bring to market? And then MyMagic+ is pretty -- it\u2019s been around for a while. And I\u2019m just wondering if you think there\u2019s a real transformation ahead for the business as you take advantage of the last year-plus of downtime to reinvent the experience? Just maybe add some context would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Ben, thanks for the questions. Thank you, Ben. I think, we\u2019ll start with, Bob, if you want to talk a little bit about some of the technology at the parks, and then we\u2019ll go to Christine to talk about Hulu ad growth, IPL and LatAm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Ben, you used the correct word, transformational. MyMagic+ was us basically sticking our toe in the pond of this type of transformational work. Disney Genie though is that program on steroids. This is going to revolutionize our guest experience. Guests are going to spend less time waiting and more time having fun in our parks with a dramatically improved guest experience. That\u2019s going to make their navigation of their day and their planning of their day much easier. Essentially, what it\u2019s going to do is take the consumer preferences that we know from our consumers, given what we know from them, and blend that with basically industrial engineering data that we\u2019ve got in terms of how our park is operating that day and meld those together to make suggestions on the fly that not only will lead to that improved guest experience, but at the same time lead to substantial commercial opportunities as the guest navigates their base. So, it certainly qualifies in my mind for both materiality and transformational impact on our business from a yield standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Ben, I\u2019ll try to go through your -- hope I can remember them all. So, Hulu. Hulu did have very strong advertising growth in the quarter, and we continue to see that growth quarter after quarter. We haven\u2019t specifically quantified it, but I would say that it is driven by higher impressions as well as rates. And as I mentioned, the ability for us to use the dynamic ad insertion in Hulu Live is also a benefit. I think, the advertising sales team, if they had more inventory, they could certainly sell it. There\u2019s that much demand for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to put some context around it, because I think it\u2019s a precursor of what the upfront showed is that the -- we came out of a very strong upfront but we had about 40% of the total upfront dollars into streaming and digital. And a lot of that is not only across Hulu, but also across our other entertainment and sports platforms. So, I think that just shows that the kind of advertising that\u2019s going through Hulu is certainly a growth driver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The IPL is coming back. It\u2019s scheduled to come back on September 19, and it will run through, I believe, the last final match is scheduled for mid-October, around October 15. When you think about Disney+ Hotstar, IPL is certainly a very, very important component of the offerings, but it\u2019s only one because we also have a very broad portfolio of general entertainment as well as other sports. It has a lot of original content, library content in it from all of the Disney+ brands and IP. And we added over 18,000 of original local programming every year. So, we feel really good about not only the IPL but also Star -- Hotstar+.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In LatAm, we will be -- LatAm, the launch for LatAm is in later this quarter. But I don\u2019t have any updates to anything new on the sports side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Doug Mitchelson of Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Mitchelson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, two questions. It\u2019s certainly nice to see the U.S. parks profitable in fiscal 3Q. And I note that operating expenses are back at 81% of 2019 fiscal 3Q levels, while revenues about 60% of 2019 levels. And that seems consistent with commentary that you made in the past that you have to ramp overhead in advance of consumers coming back to the park. So, my question is, is the overhead now sort of re-ramped at the Parks? Should we look at this as the right overhead level? And from here, it\u2019s variable cost growing with consumers continuing to come back, and that\u2019s how we should think about modeling the parks going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, the second area is just on streaming. I hope you could discuss the health of Disney+. How was engagement trending in the quarter? How was churn playing in the quarter? What was the impact of Star as you merged in with Disney+ in Europe? And anything else you want to note on the health of Disney+ would be appreciated. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Doug, thanks for the questions. Bob, you may want to start on the streaming question, and I don\u2019t know if you want to make some comments on kind of parks\u2019 cost ramp. And then, Christine, you may want to jump in on that as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. In terms of the health of Disney+, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. We\u2019ve got world-class content from the world\u2019s best storytellers, plus our international launches, plus the power of the Disney bundle. And you asked the question about churn. We\u2019re really pleased with churn. We\u2019ve taken some price increases over the past few quarters. And what you\u2019re seeing is that our churn has declined, including in Latin America where we went up -- I mean by -- in Europe, sorry, by \u20ac2 when we added Star brand as a sixth brand tile. So, our retention is very healthy across the globe. We\u2019re really, really pleased with that. And I think, again, it really goes back to the price value that we\u2019re offering our guests. When you take out Luca, Loki, Falcon and the Winter Soldier. There\u2019s something essentially new each week. You blend that together with a tremendous local investment that we\u2019re making in our international territories. And it\u2019s really a price value proposition that is really great. So, the fact that our churn is so low, our engagement is so high, our retention is so high amongst the local corridors where we\u2019re taking price increases, I think, says everything about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of -- and I\u2019ll start this off, Christine, on the cost side and what we expect to see in terms of our parks profitability. But right now, you can use a lot of different metrics to look at our business. In California, we\u2019ve got all three of our hotels open, for example. We\u2019ve got 70% of our available rooms open in Walt Disney World. So, you can see that we\u2019re not quite 100% available at this point. But, I think that a lot of the costs from here on out are variable. Obviously, as we scale our business and we get up closer and closer to 100% capacity, our efficiencies and operating become much, much higher. So, I think you\u2019ll see disproportionate benefit as we go from here on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Christine, I don\u2019t know if you want to elaborate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would just add that our parks -- our plan -- and once again, this is -- we\u2019ll monitor the trends with what\u2019s going on with the Delta variant. But, we\u2019re expecting to have our parks domestically be fully staffed up by the end of this calendar year, calendar 2021. And we\u2019re going to be increasing capacities as we have the demand, and we\u2019re also being able to train -- thoroughly train our employees as they come back in. And once again, this is an ever-changing landscape with COVID, but we\u2019re going to be particularly careful, and we\u2019re also going to bring our capacity online aggressively, but measured. We\u2019re not just going to open up the doors and flung them open. So, we\u2019re doing this in a measured fashion for the health and safety of not only our guests, but also our cast members in the parks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug, thanks for the questions. Operator, next question, please?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich of Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jessica Reif Ehrlich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. I have one on Disney+ and one of film. You mentioned that you\u2019re opening in Japan, fully opening in Japan in October. It\u2019s such a big country with a huge affinity for everything Disney. I mean, the Parks are doing really well there, and it\u2019s a very affluent country. So, just wondering if you could give us any color on market size and ARPU. And then, on film, the industry has undergone such massive change over the last two years towards streaming. But obviously, the pandemic has had a big impact, but it was moving in that direction anyway. With the jury out on like how much the box office will come back to pre-COVID levels, how do you think about the success of a film in today\u2019s environment? And how does that impact the way you attract talent, the way you compensate talent? And what changes do you expect to make, if any, in your film strategy from here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Jessica, thanks a lot. Bob, why don\u2019t you take the film question? I don\u2019t know if you want to make any comments on Japan? And Christine, you may want to jump in on that one as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Obviously, this world has been disrupted by COVID, and we\u2019re all reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace. We\u2019re very grateful for the fact that we had the ability to take out a lot of titles, both not only in the theatrical marketplace for those that prefer to watch a film that way, but also at the same time through our Disney Premier Access, and that was a winning strategy for us to give consumers the choice for those that decided that going back to a theater was not for them at the same time. That said, these films, Jessica, were really conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior three, four years later and certainly didn\u2019t know about COVID at the time. So, we\u2019re dealing under a different sort of set of conditions than we thought.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What I will say is that just like we\u2019ve done many times before, as the business has evolved and transformed, we\u2019ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent, so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feels satisfied. And I will say that since COVID has begun, we\u2019ve entered into hundreds of talented arrangements with our talent. And by and large, they\u2019ve gone very, very smoothly. So, we expect that, that would be the case going forward. Certainly, this is a time of anxiety the marketplace as a lot has changed recently. And again, these films that we\u2019re releasing right now were imagined under a completely different environment than unfortunately, the fate has delivered us. But, we\u2019re trying to do the best thing for all our constituents and make sure that everybody who\u2019s in the value chain, if you will, feels like they\u2019re having their contractual commitments honored, both from a distribution and a compensation standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What I\u2019ll say before I turn it over to Christine on Japan is that remember that heretofore, as we\u2019ve launched Disney+ around the world, in Japan, we\u2019ve done it with a fairly limited distribution system and that\u2019s about the change going forward. But at the same time, that market is under, as they call it, a state of emergency. And that certainly has disrupted that marketplace as we go from a fairly limited distribution now to a much more broad distribution. Christine?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Jessica, we fully agree with your assessment of the market and the high degree of affinity that the Japanese market has for Disney IP. So, we\u2019re totally agreeing. We did, as Bob say, a soft launch with a partner last year, but it was only to a small part of the market, and we\u2019re really excited to do the full launch that will be in this coming October for Disney+. And we\u2019ll see how that goes, but we have been very cautiously optimistic as we always are, but we believe that that IP is going to resonate. We don\u2019t, as you know, break out ARPU by individual markets. So, we\u2019ll just be giving you the Disney+ ARPUs the way we currently are doing it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question comes from Jason Bazinet of Citi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Bazinet</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think your digital pivot is incredible, impressive. But I want to ask a question that will come across as bearish and it\u2019s really not. It\u2019s an honest question. I think in the salad days of pay TV, maybe we had, I don\u2019t know, 75%, 80% pay TV penetration and people who were paying U.S. households $70 a month or something. And the most mature SVOD platform out there is probably at 50% penetration with ARPUs that are sort of one-fifth of pay TV ARPUs and not really growing. And I just wonder what -- if you guys have any thoughts on what that means for the broader sort of digital pivot? And are there things that the industry needs to do as an example, if you think it\u2019s tethered to piracy or something like that that could sort of give you another -- or the industry, including you another leg of growth in terms of net adds that people aren\u2019t thinking about? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Bob, do you want to take that? Thanks, Jason, for the question, by the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Jason, I\u2019d like to think of it like we\u2019re in the first inning of the first game of a very long season. We\u2019ve not even been at this right now as Disney, at least for two full years. Despite that two full years, as you suggested, we\u2019ve gone into 61 countries in 21 months. So, we\u2019re very proud of that and we\u2019re proud of the success that we\u2019ve had. I would caution not to come to any conclusions about the size of the market. We\u2019ve got a TAM of 1.1 billion households across the globe. And we\u2019ve only just begun our journey. And as I think you see, what\u2019s really going to make the difference for Disney is our spectacular content told by the best storytellers against our powerhouse franchises. You put that in the context of also all the local investments that we\u2019re making. And I think we\u2019re going to have a bright future ahead. And I understand the benchmark that you\u2019re using, but I think this is a different marketplace. And I think we\u2019re charging forward to maximize the opportunity, given our unique combinations of not only distribution platforms, but intellectual property and storytelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brett Feldman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earlier, Bob, you were talking about the power of the Disney bundle. And in the U.S., you\u2019ve really taken a bundle-centric approach to the market. I was hoping you can give us some insight into that power. Whatever you can share to help us understand, why the bundle is so successful, either the portion of your subs, Disney+ subs that are in the bundle or the portion of the gross adds or engagement, whatever you can offer would be great. And then, just expanding on that a little bit, if the bundle really does appear to be the most compelling product in the portfolio, why not just make it the core product and eliminate the complexity to the consumer in terms of thinking about which elements of the Disney entertainment ecosystem they want and just give it all to them at once? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brett, thanks for the questions. I\u2019ll turn them over to Bob.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. In terms of the bundle, you see that the majority are not -- maybe not the majority, but a good chunk of our marketing now is going towards a bundle. And that\u2019s because the -- while we enjoy extremely low churn rates on our individual services, the churn rates on the bundle are even lower, surprisingly low even for us. And I think what that says is that our customers enjoy the price value of the bundle that we offer and getting an incredible amount of content for a really good price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While I can\u2019t comment on some of the specific percentages that you\u2019re probably looking for, but I will make a comment on sort of going forward. You noticed that across the world, we\u2019ve got different business models. We\u2019ve got different business models for two reasons. Number one, the unique situation that we find ourselves in each market whether it\u2019s Europe or LatAm or Asia or North America tend to be different in terms of what rights we have and what the consumers are actually looking for. But that also gives us an opportunity to test out different propositions. Obviously, the proposition that we have in Europe with Star as a 6-brand title looks significantly different than our relatively unbundled approach that we have in North America. Again, we\u2019re in the first inning of the first game of all the long season, and we\u2019re taking all this into account.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There may also be certain constraints that were under that could, at least from a short-term standpoint, limit our ability do what long-term we might feel was ideal. But frankly, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s ideal yet. I will say that we\u2019re extremely pleased in every market that we\u2019ve launched our direct-to-consumer services. We\u2019ve exceeded our expectations in every marketplace. So, in terms of the way that we\u2019ve approached the market so far, it\u2019s worked really, really well. Is there an opportunity for improvement by considering something different going forward? Possibly. But, we\u2019re going to continue to learn. And as we learn, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll refine our offerings in the marketplace, as time goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Brett, for the questions. Operator, given the time, I think we will take our final question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Our final question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Hodulik</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe the 2024 guide, I think, included 30% of subs coming from Hotstar. I mean, given the strength in Hotstar, does that guidance still hold? And then, given the content release schedule that we have in the second half of the year, do you expect the net add trends in what I\u2019d call the core Disney+ markets to improve in the back half? And then lastly, just anything you could tell us on just Disney+ Day in November in terms of how you expect to promote? Is it global or U.S. or just -- or any new content that could be launched that day, anything you could tell us on that would be great?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lowell Singer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, John, for the question. Bob, why don\u2019t you start on Disney+ Day and then Christine, you can take the question about Hotstar guide, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Chapek</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Disney+ Day will be a balanced approach between global and local product. We\u2019re going to have a real exciting lineup, as you might guess, as we approach those consumers who have not yet signed up for Disney+ with a really attractive group of titles to be announced. But, I think it gives us an opportunity to provide a focal point for consumers that have not yet tripped over to Disney+. And I think it\u2019s going to give us a focal point of excitement and energy that will not only pay benefits in the U.S., but globally as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the net add question and how that\u2019s going to improve, first half versus second half, again, we feel really great about our sub trajectory. As we learn, though, we\u2019re finding out there\u2019s tremendous seasonality in this business that we may not have known about before we really got into it, or at least in terms of above expectations. Also, I want to caveat that our sub adds aren\u2019t necessarily going to be linear. I think a lot of the marketplace expects these things to sort of be a straight-line math, and it\u2019s not really turning out that way. And as we\u2019ve indicated before, we do believe our first half adds this fiscal year will be stronger than the second half adds. That said, we really feel great about our trajectory. Christine, do you want to take it from there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christine McCarthy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. And I would just add one thing on the Disney+ core markets. In this third quarter, when you exclude Disney+ Hotstar, we saw solid sub growth quarter-over-quarter net adds consistent with what we saw in the previous quarter. So, we feel really good about the continued growth in our core markets. And on Hotstar, at Investor Day, we said that we anticipated Hotstar to be between 30% and 40% of total Disney+, and we\u2019re not updating that guidance at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lowell Singer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.
