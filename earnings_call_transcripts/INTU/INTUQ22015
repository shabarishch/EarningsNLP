My name is Sayeed and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]</p> <p>With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matt Rhodes, Intuit\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rhodes, you may begin.</p> <p><strong>Matt Rhodes</strong></p> <p>Thank you, sir. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2015 conference call. I am here with Brad Smith, our President and CEO; and Neil Williams, our CFO.</p> <p>Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit\u2019s results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon, our Form 10-K for fiscal 2014 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit\u2019s website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We have reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad Smith.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brad Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thank you Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. It has been an eventful few weeks at Intuit and I suspect you have lots of questions. Before we get to your questions, I would like to provide as much context around the recent events as possible while keeping the bigger picture in mind. The bigger picture is straightforward. Our financial results are strong through the first half of fiscal 2015 and we are reiterating our guidance for the full fiscal year. Furthermore, our small business momentum has taken a step rate change in a positive direction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The growth in our QuickBooks Online subscriber continuing to accelerate at a very healthy rate. With that said, I know the tax is on everybody\u2019s mind, given the time of year and the recent press coverage. So let me start there first. At the highest level, our tax strategy is on track. We are in the second year of a multiyear journey to achieve our product vision of taxes are done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This year\u2019s TurboTax significantly expanded its data import capability. Nearly 75% of customers can now digitally import W2s directly into the product that is up from less than 30% last year. This is a huge step towards our vision if taxes are done, making tax spreads easier and more accurate and this has led to several points of improvement and conversion for customers who choose to import their data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The TurboTax experience now uses more advanced data driven insights to tailor the interview to your unique situation. We refer this as responsive experience and is saving significant time and questions off of the average taxpayers preparation experience. In addition, TurboTax users can now seamlessly move across platforms, working online on tablets or on smartphones with the ability to start, stop and continue their taxes on the device of their choice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And for the first time ever Americans with more straightforward tax needs were able to file both their Federal 1040A or 1040EZ returns as well as their state returns for free. This was a powerful offer for this 60 million Americans, many of whom with paycheck-to-paycheck and count on their tax refund as being the biggest paycheck that they will receive in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The collective impact of these innovations is showing up in the customer experience. So far this season, our ability to convert those who visit the TurboTax.com website and to those who file a return is up a couple hundred basis points. This improvement is on top of a big advance in conversion that we drove last year as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our net promoter scores for TurboTax Online are also up about a half dozen points, which is quite encouraging. This improved product experience is helping reduce customer care calls, which were down roughly 20% year-over-year. And when it comes to the Affordable Care Act, we worked hard to ensure that all tax payers could easily and accurately meet the new ACA requirements with TurboTax.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Unlike some other tax services, TurboTax includes all the necessary healthcare forms for free. We don\u2019t see any evidence that ACA is driving TurboTax customers to other tax prep solution. In fact, the ACA section of our product has been one of our highest converting tax topics this year, which gives us confidence that our ACA implementation is meeting our customers\u2019 needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Translating the sum total of these initiatives, total TurboTax units grew 11% through February 14 versus the comparable prior year period. TurboTax Online units are up 19%, while TurboTax Desktop units are down 7%, which takes to me the recent events of the past few weeks, which has not been our best in terms of customer confidence. There were no excuses when you make a mistake and we owned our mistakes and taken steps to make things right. At the same time, we\u2019ve been at the forefront of the ongoing battle to fight fraud in the U.S. tax system, navigating lots of misinformation along the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me share some important context around both of these events. First, let me address the change to the TurboTax Desktop product lineup, which we subsequently reversed. We didn\u2019t live up to our customer expectations and our net promoter scores are down for the TurboTax Desktop product as a result. So why do we make the change in the first place and what have we learned from the experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t need to tell anyone on this call that we are in the midst of a massive platform shift of the cloud, and every established technology company is dealing with the balance of serving customers on legacy products while advancing their efforts and serving new customers on the next generation platform. It\u2019s no longer a desktop software world. Our computers no longer come equipped with optical drive and shelf space allocated software is down 50% in retail stores over the last five years. But that said, a subset of customers simply do not want to move to the cloud. Many of these are long-term loyal customers, who have used the same product for 20 years, which is why we've always been steadfast in our position that we won\u2019t push a software delivery model on a customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that context what happened? Well, last year, we had moved to a complexity baseline up in our TurboTax Online portfolio, steering customers to the best offering for their particular tax situation. This included moving Schedule C, D, E, and F from the looks into our premier and our home and business solution. These are the schedules that enable to file or to report items such as investment gains and losses and small business expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our goal was simplification. So customers were clear, which product was right for their particular tax needs. For over 20 million online customers last year, the implementation went smoothly. So this year, we thought to complete the alignment by making similar changes to our desktop offerings. Our goal was to streamline product development and bring any new innovation from our online product back to our desktop customers as well. And for those who might eventually choose to migrate to the cloud, they would enjoy a consistent and familiar product experience. Good intensions but misinformed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These loyal long-time desktop customers simply didn\u2019t want a different product experience. And they certainly didn\u2019t want to have to upgrade and pay a higher price for the functionality that they have always had in the looks. In addition, we didn\u2019t make the communication clear enough and we didn\u2019t make the transition easy. For the 3% of TurboTax customers who were affected, it was simply unacceptable and they were right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So here is what we\u2019ve done. Following a very public and heartfelt apology, we announced that next year, we will offer the TurboTax to looks Desktop software that our customers know and love, restoring all the forms that they've counted on for years. Returning Deluxe desktop customers who need to upgrade this tax season are now able to do so seamlessly within the product for free.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">More importantly, what lessons did we learn? First, know the customer. We're a customer back company and we didn't effectively apply our own expertise to this situation. Second, ease to transition; if you're going to make product changes, make sure you have early dialogue with the customers and make the transition slowly. And finally, act quickly and decisively. When you hear noise, assume smoke means fire and jump on the situation fast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Which takes me to the more recent news surrounding the concerns of increasing fraudulent activity in the U.S. tax system, particularly at the state level. As we have shared on many occasions, the privacy and security of our customers\u2019 data is the top priority in our Company. We've been working for years to apply the most advanced technologies and techniques to ensure the safety and privacy of our customers\u2019 information and we have been doing this in conjunction with the overall industry and with government as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was just in Washington three weeks ago, giving a key note to more than 100 policy leaders on this very topic. In more recently, Intuit and some states saw an increase in suspicious filings. As a result several states communicated their intention to stop accepting TurboTax e-file. So we took the precautionary step on Thursday, February 5th to temporarily pause the transmission of e-file state tax returns for all states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">After our preliminary examination of the recent activities with the help of a third security expert was concluded. We believe and we continue to believe these instances of fraud did not result from security breach of our systems and the information being used to file fraudulent returns was obtained from other sources outside the tax preparation industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We implemented targeted security measures to combat the type of fraudulent tax activity that we were seeing. These additional steps included the implementation of more advanced multi-factor authentication, which is a proven technology for protection against identity theft. With these measures in place, we resumed e-filing with the state the next day. Once, we felt comfortable that our customers\u2019 privacy and security were not at increased risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we're continuing to work with the state as they build their own anti-fraud capabilities and we will continue to share best practices as we work towards the common best interest of the taxpayer. To assist any customers, who are victims of tax fraud, we\u2019re providing a dedicated toll free number with direct access to specially trained identity protection agents, who will provide comprehensive support and filing assistance. So to summarize consumer tax, the underlying health of the business and the product innovations that we're delivering are having a meaningful impact on the customer experience and on our result season today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that said, we suffered a self-inflicted wound on the desktop line-up situation, and we are leading the battle against an industry wide threat of cyber fraud targeting the US tax system. And all of this happened within the first few weeks of a 100 day tax season. But there is plenty of time left on the clock and if you look at the scoreboard so far, you'll see that the IRS data through February 6th shows that self-prepared e-file growth was up 70%, contrasted with assisted e-files down 4%. This leads us to believe that the do-it-yourself software category continues to gain share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">TurboTax e-file growth and other third party data also indicate that we\u2019re gaining a couple points of share so far this season. So we\u2019re keeping the bigger picture inline and we\u2019re going to emerge from both of recent situations wiser and even more focused. Which takes me to the pro-tax side of the business, where we\u2019re seeing positive early trends and customer acquisition. In addition, we\u2019re delivering more innovation in pro-tax than I have ever seen in my time at Intuit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We provided tools and training for our pro-customers to manage the ACA situation and to help their clients achieve the best possible outcomes. We\u2019ve refreshed TurboTax Personal Pro, which we used to call CPA Select, and we expect the new interface and the accountants\u2019 engagement tools to drive growth. We\u2019ve launched Intuit Link, a data and document collaboration tool for accountants that save time and simplify the accountants to client communication and we\u2019ve enabled eSignature capabilities that help accountants streamline their work and securely transmit signatures on important forms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I realize that I don\u2019t need to remind anyone that it\u2019s early in the season for both of our tax businesses, but I will. We\u2019re staying agile and I am very pleased with our products and our pace of innovation. We\u2019re focused on improved execution and delivering for our customers and shareholders for the remaining season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s talk small business. As I foreshadowed earlier, the QuickBooks Online ecosystem continues to build strong momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers by 50% in the second quarter that is up from 43% growth last quarter. We added 100,000 QBO subscribers quarter-over-quarter and we now have 841,000 paying subs worldwide. Outside the U.S. QuickBooks Online subscribers were up more than 170% to a 127,000 in line with last quarter\u2019s rapid growth. Our QuickBooks Online customers continue to add payroll and payment solutions at a healthy clip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the U.S., our new customer online payroll attach rate was 21%,. This is a step down from roughly 30% last quarter, but it\u2019s due to a change from an opt-out payroll signup to an opt-in. We expect our attach rate to be in the low 20s over the next few quarters but we expect to see improvements in retention as a result of this change. Our online payments attach rate was 8%, which is up from 7% a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To help fuel our international growth, we made two acquisitions in the past quarter that will add key features and functionality to the QBO ecosystem and targeted geographies. In the UK, we acquired Acrede, a provider of payroll solutions with global compliance and data security. They are easy to use cloud technology can be customized to deliver payroll across multiple geographies. We also acquired ZeroPaper, a developer of fast and mobile financial management tools for entrepreneurs and micro businesses in Brazil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to these acquisitions, we launched QuickBooks Self-Employed, designed specifically for the rapidly expanding population of freelancers and independent contractors. As you may recall, there are roughly 12 million of these businesses in the U.S. Our QuickBooks Self-Employed Solution helps the smallest of small businesses, manage their finances throughout the year, and provides integration with TurboTax to simplify tax reporting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These sole proprietors generally don\u2019t see a need for all the functionality and traditional QuickBooks online. They simply need to keep their personal and their business expenses tracked and separated for tax time. This product is gaining real momentum and I\u2019m excited about the partnerships we recently announced with Stripe, Uber, Lyft, TaskRabbit, and others all centered around this particular market. We\u2019ll continue to add partners to expand our presence in this rapidly growing on-demand services marketplace. So in total, it\u2019s been an eventful first half of the year and it has been a strong first half as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m inspired by our team\u2019s commitment to overcome obstacles, while continuing to reimagine the tax prep experience in both our consumer and our pro-tax businesses and you\u2019re going to see much more innovation from these teams over the next few years. On the small business half of the house, our small business subscriber growth is accelerating and we remain focused on global customer acquisition, all being powered by cloud-based services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that overview, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Neil Williams</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Brad. First, I'll start with overall company results, which all came in higher than our guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we delivered revenue of $808 million, up 3%, a non-GAAP operating loss of $20 million, a GAAP operating loss of $98 million, a non-GAAP loss per share of $0.06, and a GAAP loss per share of $0.23. These factors reflect our strategic decision to deliver ongoing services and releases for future desktop offerings. As a result, revenue for future desktop software licenses will be recognized as services are delivered rather than up-front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we discussed previously, approximately $400 million in revenue will move out of fiscal 2015 into later years. The impact and quarter seasonality of this shift varies by business unit. The business with a shift is hardest to understand from an external perspective is probably professional tax. I\u2019ll provide some data to help with modeling of the pro-tax business in a moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the business segments. Total small business group revenue declined 1% for the second quarter. Again reflecting the impact of changes to the desktop product resulting in ratable, rather than up-front revenue recognition. QuickBooks total paying customers grew 20%. Small business online ecosystem revenue grew 26% and customer acquisition in our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks online subscribers grew 50%, accelerating from last quarter\u2019s growth rate. Online payroll customers grew 23%, online active payments customers grew 3%, and online payments charge volume grew 20%, driven by an increase in charge volume per customer. Payments customers attached to QuickBooks Online grew over 90%. We\u2019re focused on growing payments in the QBO ecosystem while de-emphasizing other services such as standalone GoPayment\u2019s customers. Rounding out the online ecosystem, Demandforce customers grew 18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our primary goal is converting non-consumption to capture a larger share of the 29 million small businesses in the U.S. and millions more around the world. To do this, we\u2019re leaning into QuickBooks Self-Employed which is part of our QuickBooks Online lineup as \u2013 and is included on the QuickBooks Online Subscriber line on the fact sheet. We had approximately 4,000 QuickBooks Self-Employed paying subscribers at the end of the second quarter. We\u2019ll continue to call out the growth of this subscriber base over the next few quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the desktop ecosystem, QuickBooks desktop units declined 26% in the second quarter as we continue to emphasize QuickBooks Online. More than 80% of our new QuickBooks Online customers are new to QuickBooks rather than migrating from desktop. Within the consumer group, consumer tax revenue was up 54% versus the second quarter last year as we benefited from an earlier start to the tax season this year. As you may recall, last year IRS opened e-file on January 31, pushing revenue into our third fiscal quarter, so this year we\u2019re returning to a more normal seasonal pattern.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strong unit growth today benefited from our Absolute Zero Promotion, and our paid mix was also a bit better than we expected. In the back half, we face a tougher compare, but we still expect units to grow faster than revenue for the season. ProTax revenue was $11 million, down 69%. As we previously discussed, we expect a revenue shift of $150 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 due to changes in our desktop offerings. To help with your modeling, we expect ProTax revenue of about $125 million in the third quarter of 2015 and about $100 million in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.4 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. We also look for inorganic opportunities, and in the second quarter, we competed two acquisitions, bring us to a total of four transaction so far this fiscal year, totaling approximately $90 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve also repurchased $555 million of shares in the second quarter with about 1.2 billion remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We intend to be in the market consistently during the year. Our board approved a $0.25 per share dividend for our fiscal third quarter, payable on April 20th. This represents a 32% increase versus last year and reflects our large and growing cash position as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking ahead, we have reiterated our financial guidance and raised our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance for fiscal 2015. We also provided guidance for the third and fourth quarters and you\u2019ll find our guidance details in the press release and on our fact sheet. As a reminder, we will provide our next tax unit update in April, soon after the tax season ends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brad to close.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brad Smith</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thanks Neil. I know we\u2019ve taken sometime here to cover a lot of turf, but I hope it\u2019s been helpful context in advance of your questions. We have a lot of opportunity in front of us and at the end of the day, it all comes down to great people and I like what I see in our company\u2019s culture and in our employees. It is truly my privilege to be able to serve alongside them each everyday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, let\u2019s open it up to you to hear what\u2019s on your mind, Sayeed?</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good afternoon. Brad, on the tax side, you mentioned the conversion rate went up year-over-year. I\u2019m just curious if you could give everyone a sense of what that conversion rate is today and what do you think you can do to continue to drive those conversion rates going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Brent, thanks for the question. First of all, we would like to wait till the end of season and then at Investor Day we will share with you the year-over-year comparison and conversion rates and one of the reasons we want to do that is we\u2019re getting better every week. One of the things I mentioned in the opening remarks is the responsive experience, which is our ability to actually look at the kinds of information that we can see in your tax return and compared to others like you and truly streamline the interview process. And so that\u2019s enabling us to get more conversion out of people who are coming in and starting to return and getting them all the way through the end where they actually hit the send button.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other thing that we\u2019re able to do here is we\u2019re looking for areas where there were historical problems with entering data and then with the electronic import capabilities that we continue to advance. We\u2019re getting a lot of that work done for you so reduces friction and it is a combination of those things, which we call the taxes are done, which is really improving our conversion and I will tell you the teams truly are making improvement week over week and we will see how we finish up the season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And just real quick for Neil, given some of the renewed focused on the cyber issues that are going on in the industry, there is certainly been a lot more investments that the companies have been having to make to protect themselves. I would assume given you haven\u2019t changed the year on the bottom line that many of these increased investments around the cyber trend there are included in your guidance?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Brent, clearly that is a very important issue for us and so we are providing all the funding that we need in those areas. Anything that was not included in our guidance for the full year, we expect to reallocate from other investment opportunities within the company. So we have given a lot of thought and consideration, before we reiterated guidance for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brent Thill</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And our next question comes from Greg Dunham, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Dunham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, yes. Thanks for taking my question. One more on tax, I mean clearly the numbers surprised as to the upset, especially given some of the bad press that we\u2019ve seen in the market. Can you talk to whether or not that actually has been head wind to the business? And if it has what has more than offset that you mentioned conversion. But what are some of the other areas or we are just assuming that the headwind on some of the bad press is just overblown? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Greg, first of all we are not Hollywood and so unlike Hollywood for all PR is good PR. We certainly don\u2019t like to have negative press out there about our product or have any of our customers frustrated. I think the first piece is the desktop lineup changes, we knew we made a mistake when we started hearing the feedback from the customers. But it\u2019s important to understand that affected 3% of our TurboTax customers. So while the noise was out there and the press coverage was pretty strong, it really wasn\u2019t a significant number of customers. And we worked really hard to get in touch with each and every one of them and to they make it right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I\u2019d say first of all the scope of that wasn\u2019t a significant as the press may have played it out to be. But from our perspective we took it very seriously, because every customer matters. And the second is on the industry-wide threat of cyber fraud attacking U.S tax system. This has been an industry-wide challenge. It is not a company specific challenge, despite some of the early press clippings, whether you look at our own competitors issuing open letters from their CEO and major newspapers. Or you know the IRS has been working with the industry since 2012 to solve this or even the state of Montana issuing in some press release last week, saying, hey this is happening to more than one company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think most people understand that we are progresses, we are applying the most advanced techniques and at the end of the day they trust into it that we are going to process their information and protect the privacy and security. So I think the important thing here is the issue of cyber fraud is a threat to the tax system. We\u2019re one of the many players that want to be a part of the solution, but you have to separate the signal from the noise. The press is not representative of what we\u2019re seeing and as a result I think what you\u2019re actually seeing in our business results, our customers trust our brand, our product is even much better than it was last year, so we\u2019re improving conversion and that plays out in the marker place and that\u2019s why you see stronger tax results then maybe what the press might may have led you to believe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Greg Dunham</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks Brad.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you, Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Brad, I\u2019m wondering on the \u2013 you had a nice acceleration in the QuickBooks Online subscribers and you added about 100,000 in your guidance for the third quarter actually assumes you fewer than 100,000. If I look at prior desktop seasonality, back when it was a pure desktop business, you\u2019d actually see a nice pickup from Q2 to Q3 in terms of subs. I\u2019m just wondering is the seasonality change or is there some factor that you think drove Q2 that is a repeatable as we look into Q3 for sub adds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We know that each of our businesses do have cycles to them and in small business we do see a larger group of people buying heading into the New Year. And then it tends to tail off a little bit into the latter half of that, our fiscal year, so heading into the spring and summer. The desktop will throw you a little bit out of whack there QBO was more of a realtime consideration and you have a mix today of more service based businesses, because we\u2019re still building out advanced inventory to the mix of the kind of customer and QBO is slightly different than desktop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But right now what you are going to see is \u2013 we\u2019re still in the early learnings of just how big QBO will be in each of the quarters. This is our best forecast for the fourth quarter and it really reflects the slightly nuance differences and the service based customers in QBO versus more inventory based in desktop and the second is there is a seasonal pattern to win the peak periods are for QBO, just like there is and some of our other businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just Brad, a follow up on that. So you given a number I think out of fiscal 2017 of two million subscribers and you talked about \u2013 about two thirds I\u2019m sorry three quarters of those coming in though new customers and I\u2019m wondering if what you learned in the second quarter especially on that last part the mix of customers coming in new versus installed based conversion, if there is any change in your view in terms of the long-term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this time Walter, we\u2019re not changing that long-term view, that two million subs, our aspiration is not only to meet that but to exceed it. We\u2019re continuing to see strength in new to the franchise customers and this particular quarter 80% of QBO customers were new to the franchise; about 20% were migrators from desktop. We\u2019re doing everything we can to get desktop customers comfortable, we\u2019re adding that advanced inventory capability, or continuing to finish off things like job casting, we\u2019re running promotion, but as you learned from the TurboTax desktop experience I just walked through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some of these customers aren\u2019t going to be move in anytime soon and we\u2019re fine with that, what we really like to see is we\u2019re expanding the category, we\u2019re getting new people into accounting software that never even used our product before. So right now, we are locked in on that 2 million number. And we just raised our forecast on subs this year. So we are not moving that 2 million yet. But if we continue to close in the way we are, we\u2019ll talk to you about that in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Walter Pritchard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sterling Auty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thanks. Hi Brad, you mentioned the ACA was not causing TurboTax users to leave to tax prep. I think the bigger concern that I hear from investors is whether you install to share shift in DIY. Given your prepared remarks it sounds like that is not the case I\u2019m kind of curious if that just where we are in this part of the tax season and maybe that changes or is there something that you\u2019re seeing that the ACA just isn\u2019t having any impact on that, kind of category shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sterling, it\u2019s a fair question. And I think it\u2019s still out there for many to think through. Our assertion from early on if you look to what happened in Massachusetts back in the days when Romney was governor. There was no shift between tax prep methods when a light program was introduced at the state level so our hypothesis was if we do our job, and we take the complexity and make it simple. This should not be a catalyst to the assisted category. And we worked really hard to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think, the second thing is, we do know that as you go further end of season, you will see the assisted tax prep methods start to pickup a little bit as more complex returns get processed. But right now, this is about where we were this time last year with the assisted category growth through February 6 reported by IRS and then also where the DIY category was. And at the end of the season, the DIY category picked up a little bit of share. So I believe we are going to see the same thing happen this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My last point I would say is, we anticipated, if there was going to be a big impact that ACA would impact earlier in the season. Because when you look at those, you don\u2019t tend to have health insurance, there are often times those families that are living paycheck to paycheck they need to file early to get their refund. And the fact we haven\u2019t seen the kind of shift that some of the industry we\u2019re suggesting was going to happen, leads us to believe that our original hypothesis looks like it\u2019s going to play out. We don\u2019t expect this to be a catalyst. But we also were prepared to respond if anything changes based upon that, the balance of the season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sterling Auty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just one follow-up and you touched upon in your answer there. Can you help us understand given the timing differences on when returns are starting to be accepted et cetera. We end up with a lot of numbers over different periods of time. So lot of apples and oranges kind of reiterate for us what you think the tax season growth will be for the tax business? And kind of what the results that you just reported meanings in terms of hitting those goals?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Sterling. Also two things here IRS data through February 6, reported the category the self prep DIY category, digital category with that seven and system is down four.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I take our numbers and right now we reported the February 14th, if I move them back and make them apples-to-apples, the number of e-filed returns we submitted through the same date the IRS put their data out, we\u2019re up 13%. So right after that, you can just do the math and say, okay, we\u2019re growing 13, the categories growing 7, it looks like TurboTax is picking up some share. And that\u2019s kind of where we were last year too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you step back and look at our assumptions for the full season, our forecast were based upon the IRS total returns growing about 1% and right now that\u2019s what the IRS has reported so far through February 6. The second as we anticipated that the do-it-yourself category would pick up about a point of share out of the total returns filed. Right now through the results of February 6th, it\u2019s up almost 3 points. So it\u2019s a little bit higher than that, but we know it works through the balance of the season, it does start to shift a little more to assisted, so that'll come down a little bit if history plays out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The third lever we assumed is that we would pick up share and so far the data suggest that we picked up several points of share, but we also know we came off of a very exciting program called Absolute Zero. So we\u2019re going to say if we can hold our ground for the balance of the season and the last pieces revenue per return. We fully expect the customer growth will outpace revenues. We don\u2019t expect that to be a big catalyst and that adds up to the 5% to 7% total guidance we gave for consumer tax. I know there is a lot in there, but I hope that parse the numbers out and gave you apples-to-apples of us versus the IRS and then what our assumptions were.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sterling Auty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That was perfect. Thank you guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross MacMillan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot. I have two, so first on consumer tax, a lot of price changes this year across the portfolio. And Brad you\u2019ve said a couple of times, you expect units to grow faster than price,. But by my math so far this season it looks like revenue per unit is a bit higher than last year and I\u2019m a little surprised that just because you\u2019ve obviously got the Absolute Zero program going on. Any comments on that \u2013 is my math right and any thoughts around that so far?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ross, your math is right. As Neil was going through his opening comments, he said not only we have an exciting program with Absolute Zero, but our actual paid mix is higher than we had forecasted. A part of that is driven by the complexity base lineup we move to last year where we were trying to help customer to get into the right product. And so in TurboTax Online that\u2019s actually helped us to get customers to the right product. And as a result our paid mix is healthier. People are getting to the Deluxe and the Premier versions of the product, which is where they should have been all along.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s one. Another one is just simply conversion and attach as we continue to make it more seamless and you\u2019re able to find services that are important to you. We\u2019re able to make that mix healthier as well. So those two things are adding to slightly higher revenue per return at this point in the season, but as you know, we still got about 60% of the season yet to go. And so we\u2019re going to see how the ultimate assumptions play out when we\u2019re done on April 15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross MacMillan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the small business side obviously with the introduction of self-employed and as you are pushing into international markets, there going to be quite different dynamics around ARPU or revenue per subscriber. Just from a big picture standpoint, how would you have us think about that as we progressed through this transition because I think right now you still got that ARR number on small business online ecosystem growing at a pretty nice clip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Ross, I want to let Neil take that. I want to Batman to have a chance to speak here. I tend to halt the airways, so we\u2019ll turn it to Neil on this one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Neil Williams</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so you\u2019re right Ross. I mean as you look at the self-employed product rolling out and products growing globally where we have less attach opportunities, you\u2019re going to see the ASP be slightly coming down for QuickBooks Online ecosystem overall. We modeled all that in to the lifetime value equation we shared with you back at Investor Day and we\u2019ll update as we get in at the end of this year. We\u2019re closely monitoring how different things are impacting that as you heard us talk about on the call today. We like what\u2019s happening with the tax particularly in the U.S. We made some acquisitions that will help us get to payroll faster outside the U.S., which will help those assumptions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re waiting to see how well we do with the self-employed product that we\u2019re excited about this point, but it\u2019s still very early days. So the short answer to your question is that the lifetime value equation that we gave you back in Investor Day last year is still good at this point and we\u2019re assessing as we go through each quarter the puts and takes and we\u2019ll update that for you at the end of the year and kind of show you how it migrates from one to the other, but look for higher attach rates in the U.S. improved retention to mitigate some of the downward pressure you would see outside the U.S. where you don\u2019t have the same attach opportunities and our product like QuickBooks Self-Employed, which clearly has a lower ASP and lower attach opportunity more likely than the traditional QBO product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross MacMillan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kartik Mehta</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Brad and Neil. Brad, you talked about your desktop customers about 3% being impacted by the changes. So do you think the decline you saw in desktop 7% is the majority of that just people transitioning to online? Or I guess how would you parse out kind of the changes and then clients impacted versus transitioning to online?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, Kartik, if you look at the last five years of TurboTax desktop, the average has been a 3% decline, but two of those five years, the desktop was actually down about 6%. So it\u2019s happen to be the two years where there\u2019s a delayed opening to tax season, so it ramps up a little bit later. But I would tell you our 7% decline season today is reflective of just an ongoing secular trend that people moving out to desktop to the cloud and it\u2019s probably in that 3% to 4% range and the rest of it honestly I think was just the result of us having made a bad decision on a desktop line-up and we\u2019re going to have to work hard to earn those customers back. And so that\u2019s the truth of it about half of it is secular shift to the cloud and the other half is a self-inflicted wound that we're going to fight for and try to get those customers back.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kartik Mehta</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Brad on the QBO side you said \u2013 I believe you said 80% are new to the system. As you look at those customers, are they new businesses or they existing businesses that are now switching over to QBO?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a combination of both. New to the world businesses are finding it a lot easier to come in now and get up and running from any device they want to use including a tablet or a phone. And the other our existing businesses that historically have been using Excel spreadsheets. And so, it\u2019s really a mix of complete new to the world and then those are new to the category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kartik Mehta</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just one last question, Brad. Have you seen a change at all in your cost to acquire QBO clients based on the type of customers you\u2019re getting and maybe if you see another competition out there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see an improvement in our cost to acquire customers. As the accountants are getting more comfortable with QBO, the new re-imagined version, they\u2019re recommending it and of course that recommendation leads to a faster, yes, from the small business side. We\u2019re also getting better SCO and SEM and so ultimately our direct channels are more efficient and our account referrals are building [indiscernible]. And outside of the U.S. as were in each of the countries we are in brand building mode so the cost of acquire is more expensive in those countries but on a quarter by quarter basis, we\u2019re seeing the efficiency come in there as well. So you put it all together and our cost to acquire is getting more efficient regardless of the competitive dynamic in any of those countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kartik Mehta</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, Brad. I appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thank you Kartik.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to stay on QBO. You have seen an acceleration of subscribers \u2013 of subscriber growth ever since you launched in your harmony of product. And how do you think about where that is going to max out what are the puts and takes to say like okay 50% of something, we think it\u2019s good or can it go to 60% or 70%. I mean just \u2013 you know at some point, we\u2019re going to hit kind of a number where you won\u2019t accelerate and I just want to kind of be ready for that. And then also can you talk a little bit about the international business in terms of what are the stronger \u2013 which countries did you like and where the performance could have been better? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome. I wish that I had answer for your first one. I\u2019d like to know when that\u2019s going to max out too, not because I am anxious to get there, but I just want to see if we can blow past. You touched on it. We\u2019ve had half dozen quarters here. Now, we\u2019re continuing to accelerate quarter over quarter and we\u2019re feeling very good about the trajectory. So right now, I can\u2019t tell you that we\u2019ve got a flat line that we drawn out because we think we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity ahead of us as we\u2019re expanding the category, I wish that could be more helpful on that one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At global markets right now, with the acquisition we just made of ZeroPaper in Brazil that takes us into a new country that is now our sixth country, so we have Canada, the UK, Australia and India, before we\u2019ve been talking to you about historically. We mentioned at Investor Day, we were doing a Greenfield launch in France and now with the acquisition of ZeroPaper in Brazil. In terms of the country, these one have had different characteristics. The Canada business is rocking and rolling. It continues to grow more profitable. As we look at the UK that is a very competitive market right now with many players over there, some established, some new. We continue to accelerate our quarter-over-quarter performance, but we still have work ahead of us to get into the number one position in that market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Australia, of course, that is \u2013 somebody else\u2019s home court. And so we\u2019re there in an aggressive fashion to show that we can play in the most contested battlefield there is. And so far that has been our fastest growing market \u2013 by the fact you would expect that to be in the place where we\u2019d have the most hostile environment. India is Greenfield. We\u2019re truly creating the cloud category there because almost everyone there is desktop and quite frankly many of the products have a DOS like feel to them. And so we\u2019re currently trying to create the category and get people comfortable at the cloud in India. France and Brazil are going to be our newest entries and right now we\u2019re in the early learning phases there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One we\u2019re doing organically, where we\u2019re taking QBO and we\u2019re literally localizing it and then rolling out in the market and in Brazil we\u2019re doing it inorganically with ZeroPaper. And so each of the countries has a different set of characteristics. You put them all together and we\u2019re growing 170% and we\u2019re felling very good about our global trajectory and the fact is that we\u2019re getting more efficient than our cost of acquire each and every quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alright, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks for taking my question. Brad turning back the clock to February 6th on tax, it\u2019s nice to see you\u2019re taking share based on that 30% growth in returns that you have shared. Do you have any insight or thoughts on where the shares is coming from even just broadly weather from the larger or smaller competitors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know Brad, we really don\u2019t at this point. None of our competitors as well tax act did report as a part of Blucora, but there wasn\u2019t a lot of data that was shared there. They kind of reiterated their guidance for the season. The other major competitor is not going to be reporting until I think March. And so once they get their data out there and then we have [indiscernible], we\u2019ll be able to have a better way to triangulate, but today I would tell you \u2013 it was just be speculation on my part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. If I could follow-up with one more on the change in new QBO payroll attach, going from an opt-out to an opt-in model. Could you maybe just give us a little more color why the change and talk about the impact of the bigger picture?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sure. I can Brad. What we try to do is, make it very seamless for you to come in sign up for QBO and have payroll included. What ended up happening is a portion of customers would come in and they would find in their first bill that they were paying for payroll. And in many cases, they didn\u2019t have a need for payroll, if they didn\u2019t have employees or they were using in other service and it became a point of frustration for them, they would drop customer care calls or in many cases they would just cancel their subscription. And so what we realized was, we weren\u2019t clear enough and it was confusing. So instead, what we done is, we move to an opt-in model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re based upon certain moments in needs, you\u2019re adding an employer, and you\u2019re going into the employee tab we are able to basically make it more elegant to say, hey, do you want to have this payroll service. What we are seeing right now is, we\u2019ve got cohort analysis and we are actually seeing an improvement in our retention. The couple of 100 basis points, and that\u2019s one of the biggest leverage you have in a subscription business is improving your retention. And while we\u2019re taking a step back because I think we had a false positive when we were out there in that 30% range of attach. We\u2019ve taken a step back into the lower 20s. We\u2019re actually improving the retention and we think that\u2019s going to add up to a much healthier franchise over the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Gil Luria from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gil Luria</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask about the impact of the true zero promotion. Have you seen a higher percentage of your online TurboTax filers in the promotion versus last year. If I\u2019m not mistaken, the promotion lasted a couple of weeks longer this year. And in obviously went down from $15 to true zero, of the $15.2 million TurboTax Online use of this year was a higher proportion \u2013 in this proportion within the promotion versus of $13.6 million from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gil, the answer is more than last year. But the paid mix is healthier than we had forecasted. So we actually got the best of both worlds. I was looking at the analysis \u2013 Neil and I sat down with tax team on a regular basis as you might imagine free tax season and they are showing us the source of the new customers. And the two biggest franchise year-over-year, which are really encouraging, our first time filers people who never filed tax returns before, and then first time moving into the category.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And those are basically both saying we are expanding the DIY category of this kind of offering. And so I think this is really exciting for us because we know we can get a customer in the franchise and we can actually monetize them and grow the lifetime value if their tax situation becomes more complex. So right now, we are seeing not only a better \u2013 a conversion than last year in terms of people coming on the promotion but our paid mix is healthier than we thought as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gil Luria</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. And then on the \u2013 in the fraud situations did you find that those customers that were affected by fraud that somebody else filed under their information that the attrition there was higher than the rest of population was that a significant factor?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It wasn\u2019t and I tell you why first of all I want to make sure that I will clear in the opening comments that the headline here is our customers know they can trust Intuit. There is nothing we take more sacred in the privacy and security of their data and two things are fact today one is we\u2019re up and running and processing returns in the federal and all the states and the second is there is no breach of Intuit systems. And that is not only the result of our own analysis but outside third-parties have coming in and run all their diagnostics with us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ve reached that conclusion I think with the customers the thing that they appreciate if they\u2019ve actually been the victim of having their ID stolen from one of these other high-profile sources that we\u2019re all reading about in the newspaper. And in fact last week in Stanford University I tend to the Cybersecurity Summit with President Obama and others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over 100 million identities have been stolen in the last 12 months that\u2019s people walking around with somebody else\u2019s Social Security Number and they were attacking the U.S. tax system and trying to file these returns, and so customers understand that this is broader and what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re helping them navigate the process we\u2019re getting them access the agents who can help them get their filing done for them. And so it\u2019s not causing an attrition issue because they recognize this is in a particular product issue this is a systemwide problem and they were appreciating the help. So we have not seeing an increase in attrition due to that particular issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Gil Luria</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks for my question. Brad with respect to the new user attach rates I know you mentioned that due to a different changing with \u2013 different methodology the numbers looking little different. But can you talk to how this trajectory should continue so as to enable you to hit or exceed your goals for the long-term are we looking at a hockey stick type trajectory or do you think that the trends so far a more normal progression towards the attach of payroll and payment. So you can hit your ARR objectives longer term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Kash, we do see a continuation of a normalized attach rate we put in our prepared remarks that our payroll and QuickBooks Online we anticipate will be in the low 20s in the next few quarters. We see that moving up into a healthier mid 20s and beyond as we get pass the next few quarters. But we also see a corresponding offset which is an improvement in retention. And as a combination of those things that will drive lifetime value when we step back and we look at the payroll and the payment attach rates for new users in QBO and then you look at the penetration opportunity against the base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We really do see opportunity ahead of us and we continue to see that increasing and improving quarter-over-quarter. So aside from these next few quarters of payroll as we have to grow over this opt-in, opt-out saying we do see a continuation of strengthening attach rates for our payroll and payments products which lead to that lifetime value assumption we\u2019ll share with you at Investor Day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. With respect to the desktop QB product are there any plans to at least curtail development offer if not curtail selling of it completely and going to a maintenance mode at this point so we can get the customer base to slowly shift to the online?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was born at night but not last night and coming off of the TurboTax desktop challenge that we just had I\u2019ve learned a pretty important lesson there which these customers are happy with their product we have committed to making sure that if they want to stay on the desktop we\u2019re going to support them for as long as they want to use that product. But we\u2019re going to make it really enticing for them to get to the cloud but we have zero plans to sense of the product or to do anything that will upset them and make them decide to shop someplace else. And I didn\u2019t mean to be flip I meant to be self critical which has make a lot of mistake that\u2019s okay make two mistakes and somebody ought to slam my hand in a door.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I appreciate the candor and finally maybe I missed this about six months back. Did you share an ARR goal for the online business longer term fiscal 2017 or 2018 and if you did I look at it but if you didn\u2019t I would love to hear your thoughts on that. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, we did not Kash, we shared an outlook for company revenue which fairly is the QuickBooks Online revenues of portion that we did not get more specificity around the overall revenue guidance number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay got it. thanks a lot guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, Kash thank you buddy<strong>.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Macdonald from First Analysis. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Macdonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Good afternoon, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Jim</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Macdonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, looking at the February 14th tax dated at that point do you think the impact of a delayed filing last year versus this year is washed out and then I don\u2019t know if you can quantify the effect of your Absolute Zero program do you think in that data?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Jim, our assumption is that the effect of that delayed filing last year and where we\u2019re now its pretty much washed out at this point. We\u2019ll have to see full season how everything shakes out but that\u2019s definitely what we\u2019re operating from in terms of the Absolute Zero promotion we like the results so far we\u2019re going to wait till the end of the tax season and we\u2019ll look back and say did it achieve everything we thought it would. But so far the early data suggesting very positive for us and we like the impact of the new franchise new to the world filers coming in we like the fact people are moving into the category for the first time. We like the fact that the categories expanded and also that looks like we picked up a couple points of share and all of that was still improving our paid mix. So far, so good, but we want to wait for the full season effect to see, ultimately what the impact was.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Macdonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great and then \u2013 down in Brazil on ZeroPaper. What are your plans about using their product versus \u2013 will their product become effectively QuickBooks Online down there. What are your thoughts on how that will work in Brazil?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Jim, Brazil is a unique market they have those notion of something called [indiscernible] and it\u2019s sort of like an invoice here, the payment methodology and then you can convert that invoice into cash and that\u2019s was ZeroPaper has done, it\u2019s really for what we\u2019re doing here with QuickBooks Self-Employed it does micro businesses, but down there it\u2019s a tool that micro businesses need to do to basically get paid. And so what we\u2019re going to be doing is taking the product and then importing it over on to the QBO platform and think of it in Brazil becoming the entry level skew and then eventually that will lead out to our more main line QuickBooks Online product. So it will remain in market, it is a Brazil specific product, but that\u2019s a rapidly growing economy with a lot of opportunity and we\u2019re going to put it on our platforms, you can naturally unlock and grow into QBO overtime.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jim Macdonald</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alright, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer, your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Schneeberger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Steve and Brad. Just curious on the desktop, the pricing change obviously didn\u2019t go as you had planned and that was one of the things that was probably going to subsidize Absolute Zero. I\u2019m just curious you guys have obviously reiterated the revenue guidance for consumer tax. So I\u2019m curious Brad how confident are you at this juncture of the year, we know it affected 3% of TurboTax customers and we saw our volume impact. But just on revenue per return, obviously you have a lot of moving pieces, so was that a headwind and you mentioned earlier some positives on revenue per return. Could you just compare and contrast these at this juncture. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes Scott, so we\u2019ve seen some puts and takes so far in the season. The take was we reversed our decision and we\u2019ve give the customers the upgrade for free and that does account for some revenue that we would have originally had in our forecast, the flip of that is at Neil said even with that absolute zero we\u2019ve had a healthier paid mix than what we had in our forecast. So when you put it on the blender, it\u2019s comes out to us having the confidence to sit with you today and based on what we see reiterate our guidance for the full year. And I think it\u2019s really just the combination of all these things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Schneeberger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great thanks and then a following-up with regard to strategy and I guess we have to see at this year completes but just on going to free state with free federal. Is that something you feel that you can reverse out in the future or now that you\u2019re there, is it something that you think is a permanent thing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we\u2019ll certainly take a look at how the program played out at the end of the season and if it\u2019s an effective program, then you will see us continuing to do things that we think makes sense for customers and makes sense for our strategic goals which is growing the category and our share. If it\u2019s not a successful program, we have found that you can make the kind of changes and those kinds of promotions year-over-year and customers understand. So at this time point it\u2019s pretty premature for us to speculate what's going to happen with that absolute zero next year next year, but so far we like the results given where we\u2019re in the season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Schneeberger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jennifer Lowe</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you. Brad I wanted to touch on some of the longer term targets around QuickBooks Online subscribers specifically the increased guidance for this year and then the targets for 2017 and if you look at those I\u2019m curious how you think about those in terms of where the business is today with 80% coming in as new to the QuickBooks\u2019 franchise, versus what your expectations within those projections are around desktop conversions or potentially future contribution from the self-employed product?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So Jennifer this is as we\u2019re sitting here and speaking we\u2019re looking at the assumptions we had and then what\u2019s playing out in the market there hasn\u2019t been anything that\u2019s fundamentally different, I\u2019ll give you a couple of tweaks. One is the product is continuing to perform in a way that we\u2019re delighted by, its expanding the category and getting first time small businesses, as well as people here are new to the accounting software category in. So we originally had assumed that we will have a slightly larger portion of desktop moderator is going to the file, that number is nice at that level that we thought but we're getting more new to the franchise customers. And so the number hasn\u2019t changed the mix has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the other thing is QBSE QuickBooks Self-Employed this is new for us and we\u2019re looking to make it a global product. Right now, we don\u2019t count those customers in QBO, if they aren\u2019t paid subs. And we do have deals with Lyft and Uber and other that we mentioned that today is a free QuickBooks Self-Employed but then ultimate the way we monetize and if you want to send that into TurboTax we have an attach rate that this shows up in a different business unit called TurboTax. So it\u2019s a nice little one Intuit ecosystem in place. We\u2019ll see as QBSE growth and becomes more meaningful as it part of the paid subscribers we\u2019ll wholly break out so you can see it. But right now, it\u2019s only about 4000 of the total number of subs so it\u2019s pretty immaterial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you put all that together, we\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re going to get more and more desktop customers excited about the cloud if not we still feel good about our two million subs because we\u2019re getting more people into the franchise more than we had anticipated with the new QuickBooks Online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jennifer Lowe</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And maybe just a follow-up one quick additional question, when you talked about where those 80% are coming from you highlighted new businesses, you highlighted customers coming off of Excel. But curious if you\u2019re seeing customers coming off of competing small business accounting solutions that might have not chosen to go with QuickBooks in the past, given the more limited online offerings that might be making different competitive decisions today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, in the U.S. and I know that everyone on the call is familiar with this. We are primarily the player in the U.S. with QuickBooks desktop. The share is over 90% then you\u2019ve got a couple of other players. The online players are relatively new in the United States. So if we were to actually growing the category, the read and do businesses that is started because the economy is getting healthy, there are part of 40% that is still in Excel spreadsheets. And so that\u2019s really the opportunity there. Outside the U.S. and other countries we are able to convert some customers away from some of the competitive products. But we are also getting an influx of people coming off spreadsheet there too. But the mix is a little more \u2013 its more people coming from competitors and what you would see in the U.S., but by and large a lot of them are still new businesses and Excel spreadsheets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jennifer Lowe</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question comes from Michael Millman from Millman Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Millman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Looking at fraud on online, can you talk a little more about the EITC fraud, which I guess has been ongoing and certainly block has been doing battle with that and got to move from Congress. And then secondly, and related to tax, can you talk about whether you\u2019re seeing changes in lifetime value for the tax systems depended upon \u2013 or at least over the several years as you move more and more starting with zero or absolute zero currently. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Mike. So on EITC, yes, I\u2019m aware that our collected industry peers are all standing shoulder-to-shoulder and working with the government to try to take on the cyber fraud. And everyone has seen a different side of the animal and I know in our particular case the competitor you just mentioned, they are out there talking about two particular things, the need for license professionals and to keep an eye on earned income tax credit where they the observed some patterns that have been nervous as you might imagine we have algorithms and data we look at in our own. We produce this suspicious activity report and we have since 2012 that we provide to the IRS on anything that we see that may be unusual and then the IRS is the ultimate legal entity that determines whether that is a legitimate or a fraudulent return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so as we look at our EITC data in the context of that, we\u2019re seeing right now, that the growth of the EITC this year season-to-date is inline with our units. And we don\u2019t see that particular category sticking out as any more suspicious in our mix today than any of the other variables we look at. But that is not to say that there is something that everyone in the industry have to keep an eye on, we just haven\u2019t seen that particular pattern emerge in out own customer base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Millman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Have you seen a change in that over the last three or four years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Have we seen a change in the IT\u2019s - I\u2019m sorry can you just be lot more specific Mike?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Millman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Percentage of filers using EITC are collecting on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know Mike I honestly can\u2019t answer that question. I just don\u2019t know that data of the top of my head. So I unfortunately I can\u2019t answer the question. I apologize for that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you have a second question which was the lifetime value piece. As you saw last year our revenue per return was down slightly as we grow our units and we grow our units faster than our revenue and ultimately our strategic goal is to expand the self-prepared category and then grow our share and we said that we would love every year and a half units grow faster than revenue because we know overtime the last ten values going to improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The answer to your question about the individual tax payer are we seeing improved LTV? We are. But when you put it in an aggregated mix, you got a bunch of new people coming in they\u2019re coming in at first year and absolute zero, it does inflate the revenue per return on an average. But what we saw last year moving to TurboTax Online with this new line up, we\u2019re getting a healthier mix, have paid. I think that\u2019s where one of the question\u2019s earlier that cash or someone had asked, which is, is the assumption right, I think, revenue per return being a little healthier, the answer is yes, because on an individual tax return basis, we\u2019re actually seeing customers move up the move up the product line. So at an individual level the LTV is healthy, but in aggregate when you bring more new people in and they come in and their promotion price it\u2019s actually deflating the average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Millman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brad Smith</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Alright, you\u2019re welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, gentlemen, that is all the time we have today for questions.
