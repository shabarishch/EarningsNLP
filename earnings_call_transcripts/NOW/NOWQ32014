[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Scarpelli, ServiceNow chief financial officer. Please proceed, sir.</p> <p><strong>Michael Scarpelli</strong></p> <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Frank Slootman, our chief executive officer. Our press release and a simultaneous broadcast of this call can be accessed at our website at investors.servicenow.com.</p> <p>We may make forward-looking statements on this conference call such as those using the words may, will, expects, believes, or similar phrases to convey that information is not historical fact. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. </p> <p>Please refer to the press release and risk factors and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.</p> <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Frank.</p> <p><strong>Frank Slootman</strong></p> <p>Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon, and thank you for<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> joining us on today\u2019s call. Revenues grew 61% year on year to $179 million and billings grew 58% year on year to $201 million. The quarter was marked strong demand from our existing customer base, with renewals at 98% and upsells at 35% of annual contract values signed in the quarter as well as significant new<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> account contributions.</span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we booked a record 11 deals with annual contract values above $1 million. The company now counts 107 customers with an annual contract value in excess of $1 million. Our installed base is now at 2,514 accounts, with 473 Global 2000 customers. Some of the 18 net adds from the Global 2000 in the quarter that we at liberty disclose include Royal Philips in the Netherlands and Crescent Point Energy in Canada. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The investments in our federal sales and consulting teams are starting to pay off, with 41 deals in the federal market representing 6% of net new ACV during the quarter. We had our best federal quarter yet, with several large contract awards from organizations such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a Department of Defense joint combatant command has adopted ServiceNow [unintelligible] international theater of operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, working with Accenture federal services, another federal agency has adopted ServiceNow to provide a catalog of non-IT services to their global workforce. Many of these contracts extend beyond the IT organization. Our solutions across the enterprise continue to see strong momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We signed 24 deals for HR service automation and 13 deals for facility service automation during the quarter. One global logistics group launched its first HR shared service center in the Netherlands and part of a pilot project to align HR across the organization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With a focus on the common service experience, the HR team is leveraging ServiceNow to provide higher quality services at a lower cost. They have seen significant improvement in service quality and transparency. The group views this concept as portable and has plans to expand to two additional markets in the coming year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to see heavy use of our CreateNow platform that allows customers to build their own custom applications. In February 2013, 64% of our customers that were on a ServiceNow instance for more than six months used our platform to create an average of 3.7 custom applications per customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at that same cohort of customers today, 83% have now created an average of 6.4 custom applications per customer. We\u2019re also seeing more customers come onto the ServiceNow platform with CreateNow as their entry point. For example, one large Canadian bank with more than 45,000 employees started with ServiceNow outside of IT and with CreateNow will replace hundreds of Lotus Notes applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ServiceNow will be the designated platform for rapid application development and deployment across the enterprise and we were chosen after a three-day bake off with two other platform providers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another customer, a leading Australian bank, provides payment solutions for more than 140,000 merchants and onboards more than 20,000 new merchants every year. They went live during the quarter with a customer application built on ServiceNow to help improve overall merchant management. They simplified and automated the process for bringing on new merchants, including credit checks, pricing, training, and shipping payment devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through ServiceNow, the bank can now approve an application during the first call with a merchant, significantly reducing the time for the overall process and dramatically improving the close rate of new opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In other news, Morgan Stanley\u2019s most recent CIO survey ranked ServiceNow as a top platform vendor, with one of the highest adoption growth rates. The survey showed that CIOs plan to more than triple their usage of ServiceNow as a platform by the end of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Frank. We\u2019d like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP unless stated otherwise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To see the reconciliation between these non-GAAP results and GAAP results, please refer to our press release filed earlier today, and for prior quarters, previously filed press releases, all of which are posted on our website at investors.servicenow.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total revenues for the third quarter were $179 million, growing 61% year over year and 7% sequentially. Subscription revenues for the quarter were $150 million, representing 62% year over year growth and 13% sequential growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our average contract terms for new customers, upsells, and renewals, were 33.1, 23.7, and 24.3 months respectively, compared to an average of 33.5, 24.1, and 26.2 months on a trailing four quarters basis, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Professional services and other revenues were $28 million for the quarter, growing 55% year over year and decreasing 17% sequentially. It is important to note that prior quarter professional services and other revenues included $8 million from our Knowledge event while all expenses related to the event ran through sales and marketing. Excluding Knowledge, professional services and other revenues grew 10% sequentially. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our average total revenues per customer were approximately $275,000, an increase of 21% from the prior year and up 5% from the prior quarter. Our average cumulative annualized contract value for Global 2000 customers was $658,000 at the end of the quarter, up 72% from the prior year and up 13% from the prior quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total revenues based on geography were $120 million in North America, $47 million in EMEA, and $12 million in Asia Pacific and other, representing 67%, 26%, and 7% of total revenues respectively, compared to 69%, 25%, and 6% of total revenues in the third quarter of 2013.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total billings were $201 million in the quarter, including an FX headwind of $4 million, compared to $127 million in the prior year and $187 million in the prior quarter, representing 58% year over year growth and 7% sequential growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our weighted average subscription billings term for the third quarter was [unintelligible] months, compared to 12.3 months for the third quarter of 2013. The year over year decrease in weighted average subscriptions billing terms was due to an increase in co-terming of upsell deals, coupled with the removal of incentives to bill for periods greater than one year in our 2014 sales compensation plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our subscription gross profit was $119 million, representing a gross margin of 79%, compared to 78% in the prior year and prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 41 employees to subscription cost of sales [unintelligible] 146 employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our professional services and other gross profit was $4 million, representing a gross margin of 13% compared to 7% in the prior year and 34% in the prior quarter. Excluding Knowledge, our prior quarter non-GAAP professional services and other gross margin was 13%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we added 15 employees to professional services and other cost of sales, ending the quarter with 385 employees. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total gross profit was $123 million, representing a gross margin of 69%, compared to 66% in the prior year and 69% in the prior quarter. Excluding the $8 million in revenue from our Knowledge event, prior quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 68%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our operating margin in the third quarter was 6%, compared to 3% in the prior year and negative 3% in the prior quarter. During the quarter, we added 123 employees to sales and marketing, ending the quarter with 929 employees; 72 employees to research and development, ending the quarter with 542 employees; and 32 employees to general and administrative, ending the quarter with 309 employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net income for the third quarter was $6 million or $0.04 per basic and $0.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2 million, or $0.02 per basic and $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year, and a net loss of $10 million or negative $0.07 per basic and diluted share in the prior quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our basic weighted average shares outstanding was 146 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 163 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the third quarter, we generated $25 million in cash flow from operations, which includes the negative impact of a one-time capital gains tax payment of $11 million, resulting from the Neebula acquisition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We used approximately $18 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $7 million in free cash flow. This compares to positive $4 million of free cash flow in the prior year and positive $26 million in the prior quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended the quarter with $884 million in cash, short term and long term investments, a decrease of $73 million from the prior quarter due to the use of approximately $100 million in the quarter to acquire Neebula.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our current deferred revenue balance was $338 million at the end of the third quarter, up 61% over $211 million reported at the end of the third quarter in 2013. We ended the quarter with 2,611 employees, an increase of 957 employees for the same period in the prior year and an increase of 283 employees from the prior quarter, the most employees we have added on a quarterly basis in the history of the company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s turn to guidance for the fourth quarter. Please note that our margin guidance is on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes stock based compensation expense, acquisition related expenses, and amortization of acquired intangibles and reflects the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the fourth quarter 2014, we expect total revenues between $192 and $194 million, representing year over year growth between 53% and 55%. Our total fourth quarter revenue estimate consists of subscription revenues between $162 million and $163 million and professional services and other revenues between $30 million and $31 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect billings between $245 million and $250 million, representing year over year growth between 47% and 50%. We expect subscription gross margins of approximately 78%, professional services and other gross margin of approximately 15%, and overall gross margin of approximately 68%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect an operating margin of approximately 2%. Additionally, we expect to increase total headcount approximately 245 in the fourth quarter, including approximately 77 in sales and marketing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year 2014, we expect revenues to be in the range of $677 million to $679 million, representing year over year growth between 59% and 60%. Additionally, we expect roughly breakeven operating margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For further details on the performance of the quarter, including a company overview and market data, please refer to our quarterly IR presentation at investors.servicenow.com. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before turning to Q&amp;A, we\u2019d like to mention that we\u2019ll be holding our third annual financial analyst day on Monday, April 20, 2015, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. This event will be held in conjunction with our annual Knowledge users\u2019 conference which will take place April 19 through April 24, also taking place at the Mandalay Bay Hotel. Please mark your calendars accordingly. Registration details will be available in early 2015. We hope to see many of you there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, you may now open the call for questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe of Morgan Stanley. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, I wanted to go back to some of the comments you made around traction with CreateNow. And I think in one of the customer examples you gave, you noted that it was Lotus Notes replacement. Just curious, as you\u2019re seeing continuing success with that product, more holistically, what are some of the use cases that you\u2019re getting in with? And specifically, is a Lotus Notes replacement typical? Or are there other types of systems that you\u2019re replacing in some of these cases?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lotus Notes is definitely typical. It\u2019s a platform that\u2019s now aging quite a bit, and typically it has proliferated across to the enterprise to the point where there are sometimes thousands of [unintelligible], and they need a place to go. So we\u2019re often in situations where ServiceNow is sort of designated as the sanctioned platform for the redeployment of those kinds of services. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we see very similar things around Microsoft SharePoint. There\u2019s a ton of one-off web development, any number of tools, sometimes personal databases, spreadsheets, email, things that have never been automated before. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s a very large group of application in terms of numbers, even though the individual applications can be quite small and simple in size and so on. But there\u2019s typically an awful lot of them and they\u2019ve been orphaned over time. There\u2019s no transparency, there\u2019s security and compliance issues around them, and the IT organization is looking for a service platform that they can sanction for the organization to land those services on. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Lotus Notes is definitely a chunk of it, but there\u2019s a lot more going on than just Lotus Notes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just a quick one for Mike. You mentioned the strong dollar impact in the guidance, but do you have a sense for what that impact might have been in Q3?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the revenue side, because most of the movement moved in September, actually, it was about a million dollars on the revenue line. It was pretty much offset on cost savings below the line, so net-net neutral, but it definitely had a million impact on revenue. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ll see it has a much bigger impact going into Q4 and how we gave our guidance in 2015, if the dollar stays where it is. It took about close to $4 million out of our revenue in Q4, and it\u2019s going to take about $20 million to $22 million out in 2015. As I said, though, we do have a pretty good hedge with our costs, though. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Walter Pritchard - Citigroup </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You talked about the 24 deals that were the HR onboarding and 13 deals for facilities management. Can you talk about what sort of pricing and size of transaction you\u2019re seeing there? Obviously these are mostly in the installed base, but what sort of dollar uplift are you seeing in those cases?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The pricing is actually on a per fulfiller or per process user basis, very similar to what we\u2019re doing on the IT side. On the HR side, the types of systems they are are not so much onboarding, although we do that as well, but typically are a combination of case management, request management and knowledge management. It\u2019s that group of three apps that makes up our HR service automation. That\u2019s usually the go-to for HR organizations to get started with ServiceNow. But from a pricing standpoint, on the per-process user basis, it\u2019s analogous to what\u2019s going on on the IT side. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Walter Pritchard - Citigroup </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Mike, just a question on seasonality. I know you\u2019re not providing full guidance for next year, but we\u2019ve typically seen, as software companies get bigger, they start to see Q1 seasonality with a decline quarter to quarter from Q4 to Q1. And I know that both in 2013 and 2014, you actually saw the opposite with your billings increasing quarter over quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about Q1 of 2014. Have you started to get to the point where you\u2019re big enough that seasonality will impact you, or should we look at the last couple of years as an indicator of what we should see this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we\u2019re really not going to give any guidance for 2015 until our January call, but I would expect, as you do get bigger and more mature, you will start to see the typical seasonality you see in other companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A question around business management. At the analyst day, you talked about this being a new market you hope to enter in the future. At the time, there was a few new products pending. Can we get an update on where your entry into the business management market stands?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Business management is a designation, if you will, for a group of applications. One of them is performance analytics, which is a product that we derived from an acquisition that we did last summer. And that product actually saw quite an acceleration and an uptick during the quarter. We\u2019re quite happy with the progress that we\u2019re making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Another area that is getting a lot of attention right now is GRC, governance, risk, and compliance. Essentially, our customers are really running incident management processes around governance, risk, and compliance, when they have exceptions and they have to be worked through and worked out of the system. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re actually happy with what\u2019s going on there. The same thing is true with project portfolio management. The uptick in our customer base, I think, is now about 28% penetration, and that is a very competitive standalone market and we\u2019re making really good headway in that area as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our customers are really starting to see the benefits of running project management, resource management, and demand management functions on a platform, because they benefit from the shared data model with all our other applications and services. So that\u2019s going well. We expect to do well in the future, in years to come, in that area. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Kirk Materne - Evercore</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just had a question actually about the sort of average size of your global [unintelligible], 72% year over year. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that growth? Is it sort of just general expansion of the base or of ITSM platform? I guess are you seeing any commonalities in how those bigger accounts are growing? I\u2019m sure that the platform plays a large role in that, but if you could offer any color on that, that would be great. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So one of the things that we\u2019re observing is that the growth in terms of average revenue per customer is growing much more rapidly in the Global 2000 than in the customer base overall. I think in the overall number, it\u2019s around 20% year on year growth average revenue per customer, whereas in the Global 2000, it\u2019s around 72%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the reasons is that obviously those big accounts represent complete markets onto themselves. There is just an incredible opportunity. And from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s a very productive sales motion for our sales people, so they gravitate towards that opportunity. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the final think I\u2019ll say about it is, those large customers have a much higher inclination to view ServiceNow as an enterprise service platform versus what you often see in smaller accounts, where you\u2019re just going after a very narrow definition of the [unintelligible] problem set. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s why you see that traction, the average revenue, and the overall opportunity. You\u2019re seeing more and more separation happening in that opportunity from the general customer base. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Kirk Materne - Evercore </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Mike, I think you mentioned that you said you\u2019re going to be hiring 77 quota-carrying sales reps in the fourth quarter as part of the new employees. Is there any concentration where you\u2019re going to be hiring in terms of geographies or in specific, say, overlay positions in terms of specific products? Is there any color you can offer on that? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to be clear, that\u2019s 77 people in total into the sales and marketing organization, that\u2019s not quota-carrying reps. And those are being pretty much spread throughout the world. And as we talked at our analyst day on a percentage basis, Asia Pacific is one of the areas, just because they have a lower base, which is getting a higher percentage. But the bulk of those are still going into the North American market, which is still 67% of our business and growing very rapidly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d like to just add on a little bit to what Frank said. You were asking about how the Global 2000, how we see that growing and getting to the 658. A lot of that is also, we talked about we did 11 new deals. Many of those were Global 2000. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re really seeing a lot of these larger customers getting more comfortable, taking bigger bites of the apple day one, as well with our change in our sales organization that we have, our client account directors focused on our largest accounts, so there\u2019s upsells. We\u2019re starting to see that really pay off this year with all the upsells.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it also supports, too, the assertion that we think our Global 2000 over time, we should be extracting $2 million on average out of those people. It\u2019s going to take time. It may take another four to six years to get there, but there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t get there. We have 107 customers now, I think Frank said, that are paying us north of $1 million a year. Just with those 107, they\u2019re paying us over $1.8 million a year, on average, right now, and those guys will continue to grow too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of Raymond James.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Turits - Raymond James </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, in terms of the planned headcount adds, can you pull out how much is from Neebula? It seems that [unintelligible] relative to those, to the targets with Neebula and prior to Neebula, it seems like you\u2019re higher than the original plan. So can you talk about why that ramped up? And also, does that maybe have something to do why the margin guidance is somewhat below what we were expecting from, at least the Street was, for Q4?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we said all along, we\u2019re going to be opportunistic. If we see good people, we\u2019re going to hire good people. If we don\u2019t find the right people, we\u2019ll slow our hiring down. Based upon the opportunity we see, we\u2019ve kind of put the pedal down on the gas pedal for hiring. Yes, Neebula is accounting for that, as we said last quarter. I think 30 of the adds in the second half of the year are a result of the Neebula acquisition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that will obviously have a negative impact on our margins for this quarter, but that\u2019s not the only thing. A lot of that was the timing of those adds in Q3, but furthermore, there was some expenses that got pushed from Q3 into Q4. Hence, we had the higher than expected operating margin in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Turits - Raymond James </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you beat this quarter on margin, so it looks like it\u2019s about even for the second half, just a little push forward. And secondly, last quarter you did I think it was 32% of net new HCV was from non-ITSM. How did that square up this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was about the same this quarter. As we said before, that\u2019s not really a metric that we manage the business on, because quite a big piece of our business still comes from our legacy contracts with upsells, so you can\u2019t distinguish between what is ITSA and what is non-ITSA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Justin Furby with William Blair &amp; Company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Furby - William Blair &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about productivity across reps this quarter. And also curious around, if you look at the quarter in ratability in terms of bookings and demand environment, did you see any changes? Did it look any different from any other quarter? My guess is it didn\u2019t, based on the numbers you put up. But just would be curious to hear comments on productivity and then just ratability this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We were actually quite happy with the productivity numbers, the way they developed. We were up both sequentially and year on year on productivity, which gives us very strong confidence, not only to [unintelligible]. We\u2019re quite capable of converting the people that we hire to yield, and we\u2019re actually stepping up the numbers in Q4. So that\u2019s just a testament to the confidence that we have in the model, that it\u2019s working, that it\u2019s yielding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the overall demand environment, we\u2019re such a secular play that we typically don\u2019t feel the headwinds of sort of the natural environment in various geographies. We were just strong across the board, and we\u2019re able to very productively engage wherever we go. So we\u2019re quite happy and bullish on the demand environment out there for our particular play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Furby - William Blair &amp; Company </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You had another iteration of pricing changes in June, and I know you love this question, but what did you see this quarter, and do you feel like the latest iteration is sort of where you\u2019ll land? Or what\u2019s been the customer feedback in Q3 around the new pricing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re actually incrementally more confident that the pricing is hitting its stride. The friction\u2019s been going down. The conversations are more productive. We certainly have had our challenges, but as we said before, we keep changing if we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve got it right. But we\u2019re in a better place now than we\u2019ve been, certainly since we started here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Does it mean that we\u2019re done done? No, we\u2019re never done. I mean, pricing is a dynamic thing, and we will continue to tweak certainly some other areas of the pricing model around some of the non-IT applications where we have some focus right now, where we have opportunity to make incremental changes. But on the whole, we\u2019re in a pretty good place right now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Appreciate the additional color on CreateNow. It seems like it\u2019s really taken off. I believe last quarter you indicated that it represented about 14% of ACV. I\u2019m wondering, was it pretty similar this quarter, or did you see an uptick there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, it was between 8% and 9% this quarter. These numbers bounce around. One single transaction can move the number up or down. That\u2019s still high in a historical context. I think last quarter it just bumped up due to some transaction activity. But on the whole, that\u2019s moving well. So we\u2019re happy the way that\u2019s trending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then maybe regarding Share, I wanted to circle back on really the pace around the efforts to monetize that. Maybe how we should think about the timing of third party developers writing apps on Share?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think I said during the last conference call that we\u2019ve committed ourselves to building an app store or monetization facility on top of Share by the Knowledge \u201915 conference, which as Mike said is in April of \u201915. So that\u2019s sort of the timeframe. We\u2019re getting a lot of interest in the marketplace from our global partners and people, because we have so much market now, we have good routes to market, that we are becoming a really attractive place for people that not just write software for a living, but have people that need to build software and then sell it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Putting the monetization place is really not so much important for us as it is for them, to be able to make money and have a route to market, if you will, so they can run a business on our platform. So that\u2019s going to become a much bigger thing for us in 2015, obviously, when we start rolling that out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Stephens. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Alex Zukin - Stephens</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, if you could talk a little bit about HR case management, how you guys view that market size as you continue to have success and traction there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The HR marketplace, I think I\u2019ve said prior there\u2019s about 1 million to 1.2 million, depending on who you believe, HR professionals just in the United States, and I think the worldwide model is probably some multiple of that. So we think that opportunity alone, just for case management - forget there\u2019s a whole raft of other type of HR service applications, but just for case management, we see a billion dollar opportunity for HR. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But that doesn\u2019t include, as I said, onboarding and offboarding, compensation planning. There\u2019s so many offshoots of request response workflow processes that we can go pursue with ServiceNow. And when I say case management, it is just the incident request and knowledge side that we\u2019re talking about here, that represents that billion dollar opportunity. That is just based on how many HR people we think are out there, based on data that\u2019s publicly available. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Alex Zukin - Stephens </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then Mike, just one housekeeping question. I\u2019m not sure I heard it on the call, but just the percent of billings that were for greater than one year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We went away from giving that. Instead, what we\u2019re doing, which is more meaningful, is giving people the weighted average subscription billings for the quarter. And the reason being is you could have a billing that could be for three years or 1.2 years, and it skews things, and the weighted average gives it better. So it was 11.9 months was the weighted average subscription billing on a year over year comp of 12.3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Alex Zukin - Stephens </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Thill - UBS </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, just on the federal business, you obviously saw one of the best quarters ever. Can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re approaching this, not just from a U.S. perspective, but on a global basis, and the plans to trickle through the [unintelligible]?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry, the plans regarding the federal business on a global business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Thill with UBS </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right, government in general. Taking the success you had so far and extending that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The federal business is very separate, because it has a separate sales team, it has a separate cloud. It is a very unique business, and we think the potential of the federal business in the United States is probably as much as 10% of our contract value that we signed. And it was about 6% of our contract value this quarter, so we actually made a dent in it, because it grew dramatically on a year on year basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And most of our business is actually coming from civilian. The whole DOD side hasn\u2019t even kicked in yet. So we\u2019re actually quite bullish. It\u2019s taken us some time to mature in that space. We\u2019ve got some really good partners there. We referenced Accenture, that\u2019s very heavily involved with us in that marketplace </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you get outside of the United States, it\u2019s really part of our national market sales motion. So we attack all these foreign markets. One dynamic that is going on in a lot of foreign markets is that there\u2019s a lot of focus on the sovereignty of the cloud in countries like Germany and France, Benelux. We see it in Canada. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think in the U.S. we\u2019ve done quite a bit of damage with the Patriot Act and so on, and that static is something that all the cloud vendors will have to deal with and soon, because that will become a headwind to the business. We have some really good strategies in place to deal with that, because of the way our cloud operates. We\u2019re going to be much quicker on the trigger to be able to accommodate those unique requirements than the people that run multitenant environments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I actually view it as an opportunity more so than a challenge, especially coming from the national government organizations and in foreign markets, healthcare, financial, everything that people view as very critical in their international markets. That\u2019s where that pressure comes from. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Thill - UBS </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Mike, you\u2019ve given some great color on some of the larger million dollar plus transactions in the past, and I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s any common patterns or interesting stories you could share just on some of the larger deals that you saw come in this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There was nothing unusual with those large deals this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything noteworthy that comes to mind that\u2019s out of the ordinary, from what we\u2019ve been doing. Obviously, we did a lot of large deals this quarter. Last quarter, we were a little bit lighter. This is not a business that\u2019s super linear. These things bunch up, and some quarters we\u2019re lighter on big deals and others, we\u2019re over weighted. That doesn\u2019t mean much, because our business can sustain itself really, really well, with or without a large volume of big transactions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Pacific Crest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to the large deals, were there any elephant-sized deals in the quarter, or were they in the typical $1 million to $2 million range?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had a few that were around $3 million in ACV, two actually came in right around $3 million in ACV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the DSO front, it was a really strong quarter from a collections standpoint. Did that speak more to the linearity of the quarter, or Mike, really a focus on collections for your team?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, it\u2019s really a focus on collections. It was typical linearity that we saw in the quarter. And I was actually very pleased with my team. But it also speaks to the customers that we\u2019re selling to, I think is more important. We sell to large enterprises. We don\u2019t have collection issues with large enterprise. Where we have collection issues is when we deal with thinly capitalized resellers, and most of our business is direct with large enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rob Owens - Pacific Crest Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly, on the Neebula front, was there any contribution to deferred revenue as a result of that acquisition?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was not meaningful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There was some, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, it was very, very small. And it does not have a big impact on our revenues. It\u2019s pretty much the expenses as we had said, when we gave guidance around Neebula last quarter. It\u2019s really 2015 that it\u2019s going to start to kick in in the revenues for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A lot of interest in our product though, Rob. A lot of excitement. Our sales people really like it. It\u2019s another entry point into the enterprise, so we\u2019re very happy to have that asset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frank, as you start to expand the use case for your platform inside of an organization, how do you think your sales organization will trend around product specialization? Do you think you\u2019re going to get to the point where you\u2019re going to want to have folks who are maybe going to have specific disciplines, in HR or really kind of some of the domain areas where you\u2019re going to want to go deeper as part of upselling into a company?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a general answer to that question is yes. We are going to apply more vertical or domain expertise. And obviously, I mentioned federal. [unintelligible] sales team, and that\u2019s completely on its own. So that\u2019s the most advanced example of that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the case of HR, we need resource teams that have the ability to really look at that opportunity, to make sure that we\u2019re speaking the right language, that we\u2019re attending the correct events, that our whole go-to-market motion is what the customer expects, as opposed to viewing us as an IT-centric organization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s true in a bunch of other places. One place where we\u2019ve done very well in that regard is in big pharma. We have very large presence in big pharma, and we really have a pharma cloud now. And our pharma customers really, really appreciate the fact that we speak the language, that we know what a qualified instance is, that we can provide that. It dramatically reduces friction when we sell into that vertical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s going to be a gradual process, rather than a step function where all of a sudden the whole model is completely different. We will be applying more and more resources that are vertically oriented, if you will. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Mike, I think you sort of addressed this a little bit on fiscal \u201915, at least on Q1, but maybe if I could broaden the question out around billing seasonality, is it fair to assume that over the next, maybe I can make it a two-year comment, that we should start to see a greater percentage of your deals get billed in the fourth quarter, just given what you see with large accounts and the upsells, and folks doing co-terms on billings and just generally the trend towards some of the larger transactions? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, you will definitely see Q4 being our largest billing quarter on a go forward basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It has been. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I know it has been, but I think if we look at it, off the top of my head, I think it\u2019s trended to be a third, if you will, plus or minus a few points, of your overall billings. I mean, is a number closer to a four handle maybe the reality in a couple of years in terms of how that plays out on a quarterly basis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, to be honest, I really haven\u2019t modeled that that far yet, from a billings perspective. The only reason we give billings as guidance is because that\u2019s something you guys really look at. We actually don\u2019t manage the business on billings, quite frankly. So stay tuned. In January, I\u2019ll look into that and give better guidance around that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Greg McDowell with JMP Securities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg McDowell - JMP Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask about analytics. I know you\u2019re partially in this market already, with performance analytics and Mirror42, but in light of the announcements we saw last week from some other SaaS companies, I wanted to ask whether you think your platform lends itself to attacking the analytics market in a bigger way, and perhaps will we see some bigger analytics announcements out of you guys?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do view analytics as really, really important to the overall business. We have a little bit of a different point of view on it than a lot of vendors historically have had, because we think that the analytics market is very cumbersome, it\u2019s very heavy, it\u2019s very expensive, it\u2019s very staff intense. So we think there\u2019s actually opportunity for reinvention here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When we structure and define and automate processes, the analytics actually have to be built into that. In other words, processes have to have defined dashboards, defined reports, defined performance indicators, so you don\u2019t get into this mode of producing these warehouses that can produce millions of views, and people really don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking for. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So this is an area where we\u2019re looking for a much more structured and prescriptive action, rather than here\u2019s a million things you can do with this particular [unintelligible] and slice and dice and pivot the data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, with that, we\u2019re going to be focused on providing analytics on top of our operating data and our asset data as opposed to a generic analytics cloud, the way Salesforce is pursuing it, as well as any number of other vendors. So this is not about analytics in general, this is just analytics specific to ServiceNow applications and services that were standing up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do we think we\u2019re done with what we have today? Absolutely not. You will be able to expect from us\u2026 You know, when that will happen, I don\u2019t know. And I certainly don\u2019t have any guidance on that, but there\u2019s more to come from us in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Tim Klasell with Northland Securities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Tim Klasell - Northland Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Most of my questions have been asked already, but just wanted to hit on the competitive landscape, particularly as you move into facilities management. And maybe you can touch a little bit on the HR side as well. Are you beginning to bump into different players? And then maybe just a quick comment on what you\u2019re seeing out of the traditional HPs and BMCs of the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Taking your last question first, I don\u2019t think the dynamic with the legacy vendors has really changed. If anything, it is something that\u2019s weakening and abating more and more as our presence in the market is increasing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And typically, these vendors are really not contestants and contenders in new opportunities. They typically are incumbents that are trying to protect a position. But in new opportunities, much less likely that we would see people like that. And that is a change from the last couple of years. It\u2019s really become a [unintelligible], and really contesting new opportunities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of these other markets, on the HR side, there are some vendors that are specific case management vendors that are incredibly surprised to see ServiceNow show up in those places, because we have very different routes to market, and they have historically not seen us in that space. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re really thinking of service management as an enterprise discipline rather than something that is specific to HR or facilities and so on. So we\u2019re a threat to people that just have a specialization in one of those areas, because we have a much broader horizontal approach to that opportunity. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s different partners there as well, that we are now building relationships with. So it\u2019s really a left field thing for the status quo, to see us show up in those places. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Tim Klasell - Northland Securities </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How about on the procurement side? I think you\u2019ve spoken about that in the past. How did you see traction on the procurement side this quarter? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, I don\u2019t have any data on specifically on procurement. It is an area that we talk about a fair amount internally, within ServiceNow. We use our own systems for procurement, because we think it\u2019s an ideal area for our platform, because it is very much subject to process definition, structuring, and automation. And it\u2019s also one of those areas where there\u2019s just a ton of email and messaging traffic, all things that we can dramatically improve on. So we think that in future periods, that will become more active.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Derrick Wood - Susquehanna</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to expand on the competitive question, more from kind of a horizontal platform competitive landscape. And obviously you\u2019ve got Salesforce and Salesforce One, and they seem to be going a little bit more down the mobile path. But now you\u2019ve got Oracle, and I know it\u2019s new, but they just had a new announcement and product release on the platform side. So I guess from that platform perspective, how are you guys competing, and where may you be addressing different use cases than what they\u2019re doing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, product for product, there\u2019s always things that can compare favorably or not so favorably. We certainly see Salesforce in a few places when it comes to custom applications. Oracle, I can\u2019t say that we actively see in our marketplace. May well change in future, but we just haven\u2019t. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But let me just make one super important point, and we\u2019ve emphasized this over the years. What makes ServiceNow such a different play is that our incumbency is established through the enterprise IT organization and the IT function. And that is typically how we advance throughout the enterprise. And that\u2019s typically where those organizations don\u2019t land. They try to come in through the line of business or some functional area like sales or market or HR. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have a very, very different way of reaching our end customer than some of the vendors that you\u2019ve mentioned, and a strong advocacy position as a byproduct of our presence in enterprise IT. So there will be a lot of activity in this area. There will be a lot of contention. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a super active marketplace. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But as you could see in the Morgan Stanley CIO survey, ServiceNow really ranks near the top of platforms that CIOs know that they\u2019re using, and are planning to use. And that\u2019s not an accident. That is because of our incumbency in the world of IT. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Derrick Wood - Susquehanna </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The SI channel, you guys are getting to a billion of revenue and trying to scale beyond that, obviously. How important is the SI channel at this stage of your growth, and kind of what investments are you making now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s super important, both the global SIs as well as the managed service providers. They are big influencers and big drivers of opportunities. We\u2019re seeing a huge amount of activity with KPMG, who has been a force in our business, but also a lot of uptake by Accenture, by EY, by Deloitte. The entire group of Indian outsourcers, people like Tata are getting very active in BPO, business process optimization. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s all outside of IT by the way. In other words, these people are not necessarily coming into our business through IT. We think the SIs are more important in the non-IT side of our business, because that\u2019s really what they specialize in and what they like to do. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have active programs to engage with all these SIs. We\u2019ve staffed in these areas. We view it as very strategic. It\u2019s really a flywheel to our overall business, especially as we talk about Global 2000 accounts. Can\u2019t get around these guys. They are an influencer and a player and a participant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Luckily, they\u2019ve taken huge notice of our presence as well, and in many cases, our customers are the ones telling them that they have to become proficient on our platform, otherwise they\u2019ll be missing out on the party with future projects. So it\u2019s all working good in both directions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba of Mizuho Securities</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Abhey Lamba - Mizuho Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just wanted to touch briefly on your [international]. Do you think you guys have built up enough presence in any particular region, outside of EMEA, that could really contribute meaningfully to growth next year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we\u2019ve been investing very heavily in Asia Pacific, and we think the Japanese market is going to start to kick in 2015, as well as some of the Asian countries in general. We\u2019re not in China. We\u2019re not in India, other than on the R&amp;D side, but definitely in Singapore. Our route to China is through Hong Kong right now. And South Korea is probably the end of \u201915, \u201916, that we\u2019ll really start to do things there. And Australia has always been a very strong market for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Phil Winslow - Credit Suisse </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just wondering if you could give some more color on the orchestration and discovery of [unintelligible] your installed base? And also, how far is the penetration in those markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Frank Slootman </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Those markets are important, because that really represents our focus and our foray into the IT operations management space. Orchestration is something that we message and position as being part and parcel of service management. In other words, you don\u2019t want to think of service management outside of having a fully integrated, from a workflow standpoint, orchestration strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, our penetration in that area is not nearly what it eventually will be. We really have a goal for orchestration to be as highly penetrated as the CMDB and things of that sort. But we\u2019re not there yet, and that\u2019s because historically these markets have been very separate. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operations management and service management have been different tools, different peoples, different disciplines, and they sort of touch each other through workflows. But that\u2019s all changing, which is one of the key reason why we\u2019re in operations management to begin with, because it is changing, and we are driving a big part of the change. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the discovery side, because we\u2019re so big on the CMDB side, that always is an opportunity for us, but people can also use non-ServiceNow discovery tools with our CMDB, so we\u2019re getting more mature, stronger in that area. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of course, the addition of ServiceWatch, through the Neebula acquisition, is going to help a lot, because the ability to have dynamic service maps, that is a huge thing that the marketplace just hasn\u2019t had. So we think that\u2019s going to strengthen our business in that aspect as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we\u2019re just getting revved up on the IT OM, IT operations management side, so we\u2019re growing a completely new leg, if you will, in terms of product portfolio, routes to markets, customer presence, mindshare, all those things. It is a market that is probably several times larger than the market we historically have been in around service management. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are no further questions in queue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Scarpelli </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our website, as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today\u2019s earnings release.
