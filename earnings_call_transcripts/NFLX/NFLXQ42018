I\u2019m Spencer Wang, VP of IR and Corporate Development. Joining me today are CEO, Reed Hastings; our new CFO, Spence Neumann; Chief Content Officer, Ted Sarandos; and our Chief Product Officer, Greg Peters. Our interviewer this quarter is Eric Sheridan from UBS. As a reminder, we will be making forward-looking statements and actual results may vary.</p> <p>With that, let me turn it over to you, Eric, for the first question.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p><strong>Q - Eric Sheridan</strong></p> <p>Thanks so much Spencer. And since, Spence, you are new to the Netflix earnings call, I\u2019m going to turn the first question over to you. First, congratulations on the role as the new CFO of Netflix. Maybe give us your perception of why the role intrigued you in terms of moving to Netflix? What your first perceptions are? And some of the things you plan on making a focus for your tenure as the CFO at Netflix?</p> <p><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann</span></strong></p> <p>Sure. Thanks, Eric. Well first, I\u2019m super excited to be here. A part of what attracted me is just what Netflix is trying to build. I\u2019ve always been attracted to the high ended product quality and ambition, and Netflix has all of that and what we\u2019re creating. First impressions this is day nine. So, I haven\u2019t been here for long. I\u2019m trying to really immerse myself in the business to a lot of listening and learning, really planning to do<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> that for probably the first 60 days or so for sure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And I\u2019ve already been struck by first just the level of integration and collaboration across this company, all aspects of the company, combined with speed of decision-making and moving<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> forward has been really unique to see. So, also I\u2019ve been really impressed with just the team, the quality of the team, not just my direct team, but across the board again, and their passion and commitment to continue to innovate and improve, improving the content offering, elevating the level of the \u2013 and quality of service we deliver to our members and not just our existing members, but our new members and really driving that positive flywheel for our members and ultimately for our business.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it\u2019s really been great. I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. I want to thank everyone, all of the folks around the company for being patient and helping me with my onboarding. And really one just a quick special shout out to David Wells. He has been unbelievably gracious with his time, with his insights. And I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll always be at Netflix, but I hope for a long time to come, he\u2019ll be a friend, a colleague and a resource for me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Maybe since we are at the end of one year and the beginning of another, I\u2019d love to turn to Reed and maybe, Reed, ask you to set the table. What were the big learnings of 2018? What were the things that that you felt the company really attacked in the marketplace in 2018? And as you look out to 2019 and beyond, what are those big opportunities? What are those big challenges? What are you trying to focus the entire management team around in terms of executing against the plan looking forward for Netflix?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For 20 years, we\u2019ve been trying to please our members and it\u2019s really the same focus year-after-year. We\u2019ve got all these ways to try to figure out, which shows work best, which product features work best, we\u2019re a learning organization and it\u2019s the same virtuous cycle, improve the service for our members. We grow. That gives us more money to invest. So, it\u2019s the same things we\u2019ve always been doing at just greater scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fair enough. Obviously, I think almost every conversation each quarter starts with performance of the business. We saw strong subscribers in the quarter, strong comments about the way subscribers should continue to start the year in 2019. Throwing and open to the broader team maybe starting with Reed, but what did you see on the subscriber landscape as you look down to what \u2013 the way the business performed in Q4, and what kind of confidence that\u2019s giving you in the growth opportunities looking out to early 2019?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you look at the chart we put in our earnings letter, which has the weekly growth rate, you can just see how steady it is. And we\u2019re just continuing to work away on all the things that we\u2019ve always done. And what\u2019s wonderful is the Internet entertainment market is just growing, so we\u2019re continuing to fulfill a need that we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Eric\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do you want add anything?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Eric, if I could just add a little bit more color to Reed\u2019s comments. I would say the other facet I would highlight is that the strength in membership growth was really broad based geographically. So, really thrilled with the progress we\u2019re seeing in the international segment. And again, that\u2019s not one \u2013 any one single territory or any one single country, but really broad based and I think that reflects the global nature of the secular drivers that we have, which is adoption of broadband globally and the adoption of on-demand entertainment globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe following up on that is there anything, and maybe this is for a combination of Reed and Ted, was there anything on the local language front? I know that is a piece that we\u2019ve talked about on prior earnings videos about how local language content is driving adoption of the product on a global scale. Anything to call out there you saw in the quarter that should portend well for 2019?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I\u2019d say one thing, this quarter has been incredibly exciting and the things that are playing out and you see the numbers of \u2013you see a big number like Bird Box and You, these shows are playing incredibly globally. So, it\u2019s an interesting thing when you can tap into the global zeitgeist, which is something, which gets me very excited about the potential scale of the content business when the world is excited about something.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then on the local language side, it shows like Elite that can play very, very strong in their home country, like in Spain, but also play \u2013 play really well throughout the Spanish speaking world and ultimately through the entire world. And it\u2019s our ability to create hits and create movie stars and TV stars from anywhere in the world for the rest of the world is something that we\u2019ve really been working hard at it and have been incredibly enthused by the results in Q4 and how it\u2019s looking in Q1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe going back to something that\u2019s in the release that was also talked about in the press earlier this week that you\u2019re going to be raising price in Q1 in the U.S. market. Always curious what goes into the thought process around raising price on the service, how confident you are that customers are ready to absorb a higher price for the service when you look out? So, maybe, Reed, I could start with your perspective on how you think about pricing the product in the marketplace and what it means for subscriber momentum going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Greg, I\u2019ll punt to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I think the model we\u2019ve got is a fairly simplistic one, where we think our job is to effectively invest the money that our subscribers give us every month, so that we can give them incredible content in a better and better product experience. And if we do that well, we create more value for our subscribers and then occasionally, we\u2019ll come to them and we\u2019ll ask for a little bit more money, so that we can actually start that next cycle of investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so that\u2019s the overarching framework. And then we look at the engagement levels and a bunch of other things to try and understand what our pricing should be and generally we\u2019ve seen that those are pretty accurate and the price changes that we\u2019ve done are rolling out as expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I want to follow up with you Greg on this, because if you look versus a year ago, tremendous level of push on the personalization side and the service, more focus on mobile on the product side as you\u2019ve looked out over the last 12 months. Were those some of the things you saw that that allowed you to see either higher engagement, new use cases emerging along the subscriber base? What did you see in some of those product developments that that fed into maybe a pricing discussion?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that I wouldn\u2019t tie them so directly. I mean we\u2019re generally trying to think about every way we can make the product experience better for our members around the world and that\u2019s mobile changes, where we give them a higher quality experience. We also do things like we give them previews and the ability to sort of like do some sampling of content ahead of time to understand what\u2019s coming to the service as well as things that you mentioned like increasing. Well, we think about is more like how do we tell a story about each of the story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when we have a new show coming on how do we effectively communicate what we think is going to be relevant to each of our subscribers in a strong way. So, they can get excited about those shows as well. So, those dimensions and really many, many others, where we just constantly invest in, we don\u2019t really think about it, we\u2019re doing those things, so we can increase price. Within those things, we can just create more fun and excitement for our members. And if they have a great time, then we\u2019ll be able to invest more in content and making more product experience benefits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe just one more for you, Greg, before moving on, one of the things we noticed in the quarter was Netflix moved up the app download charts with respect to mobile smartphones in the iOS world. Always been a very downloaded app on the iPad front and the tablet front and smart TVs. Was there anything you guys did in terms of either pivoting the business more towards phone in the quarter and to start 2019? Is there anything on the product side you want to call out, because it seems like a pretty pronounced change in some of the data we\u2019re trying to analyze?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. nothing really specific and I think it really speaks more to just the general relevance that the application has and as you see us sort of accelerate in terms of subscriber additions and more members around the worlds using the service. Those members are using it on mobile in large part as well. And so we just see an increased rate of download and that\u2019s what we think is happening there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, Ted, following up on what Greg just said there, with the price increase going through and there has been other jurisdictions when you put price increases through and talking around similar frameworks, margins and free cash flow than you had talked about previously. I think the natural conclusion some of us have is the incremental investment dollar is going into content. So, Ted, help us to understand what is an incremental dollar that\u2019s being generated by the business going into on the content side, and how should we think about content investments in 2019 versus 2018?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think Reed said it right. It\u2019s more of the same, but on a continued larger scale. So the level of investment that we\u2019re doing in our original film space, it definitely changes the economics in terms of licensing films and later windows versus producing films, which is a more kind of front-loaded cash activity, but has a much better payback for us. And when you have something like Bird Box, the ability to invest in the next one is just all about \u2013 all the greater. And I think in local language content investments improved \u2013 continuing to improve the markets that are emerging for us both in the markets at scale around everyone kind of like some of the same things and other markets that are more unique content tastes like in Korea and Japan and India, where we\u2019re able to be much more fine-tuned about what we\u2019re offering those markets as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Eric, just to add on specifically to narrowly answer your question on content spend for 2019, we\u2019re not giving individual expense item \u2013 expense line item guidance, but I will say that it was $7.5 billion in content amortization in 2018. And I think you can obviously expect that to grow and the trajectory should be pretty similar. But the other thing to bear in mind is that we\u2019ve also committed to growing the operating margin as well in 2019 by about 300 basis points year-over-year to 13%. So, those will work together, so you\u2019ll see improved margin, but also higher content spend as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then we do see that payback Eric, as Greg mentioned earlier, an increased engagement, so which again continuing the virtuous cycle, where you\u2019ve got more \u2013 the more investment you\u2019re putting in, the more people are finding content that they love and the more they have value in the service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, speaking to higher engagement, I think in reading the release, I was legitimately stunned that there was more viewership data in this release, then I\u2019d see it in the Netflix release in a while, I guess obviously, probably, a lot of content that outperformed maybe expectations, but what drove some of the new sort of qualitative and quantitative commentary in this shareholder letter around engagement and viewership around key pieces of property?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would look at it like these are less financial metrics as they are cultural metric. So that what does it mean when 80 million households watch Bird Box? Well, culturally it means exactly the same thing as 80 million plus people buying a movie ticket to seeing it or 80 million households watching a TV show. So culturally, it\u2019s meaningfully out there. People talking about it, tweeting about it, posting about it, challenging each other, do different things, which we want people to be very careful when they do. But really what\u2019s important is that for part of your Netflix subscription, you\u2019re in the Zeitgeists, you\u2019re \u2013 you get \u2013 you\u2019re watching the programming that the rest of the world is loving at the same time. So that\u2019s a \u2013 so we gave you some numbers out to give you some sense of the scale and the scope of it. I think it\u2019s important for artists to understand \u2013 to have the audience also understand the size of the reach of their work. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see us ramping up a little bit more and more and giving out, sharing a little more of that information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, Eric, we also included this analysis of the total TV entertainment market in the United States. Just to point out how large a market that is about a billion hours a day enjoying television, against gaming platforms, linear, DVD, Netflix, everything. And we\u2019re running about 10% of that. So it\u2019s just a very large and fragmented market. There is an incredible set of broad uses. And we did it on television, because television is 100% entertainment time, whereas mobile phones and laptops are some percent entertainment and some percent work and communication activities. So that \u2013 that\u2019s just \u2013 it sets a broad contest. In other nations, we\u2019re a smaller percentage of the total TV viewing, because we\u2019re less penetrated, but 10% is a great mark for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric, I also think it\u2019s a good data point around the fact that we are growing the entertainment business. So, the idea that it\u2019s good for the industry to know, it\u2019s good for the creative community to know, it\u2019s good for fans to know that we\u2019re \u2013 at a time when we\u2019re growing big audience films like that, the box office by way of example, the North American box office has grown in the fourth quarter. So \u2013 and in fact had some records. So I think it\u2019s a very exciting time. And we thought it\u2019d be a good idea to give you some idea of the scale of that and how to put it in context.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No doubt driven by the theatrical revisions of ROMA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe going back to the product side and Greg, when you hear about the engagement you\u2019re seeing and the content success of the platform, help us understand a little bit of how the product might evolve. I mean, I think, one of the most unique things in the quarter was the interactivity of the Black Mirror product. Would love to talk about both the product side within Netflix and then on the content creation side as Ted talks to content partners about how that interactivity is something new, interesting and might spur engagement, product development and content relationships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think, it\u2019s a great example of us trying to take a technical capability and the flexibility of our distribution platform and trying to figure out how do we use those things to innovate on storytelling in a storytelling format. And it\u2019s super exciting to be able to do that in a way, which to your point drives more engagement. We\u2019re definitely seeing that with Black Mirror and Bandersnatch. But also sort of extends the pallet and the portfolio, the toolset that the storytellers that we\u2019re going to be working with in the years to come have to tell their stories in the most compelling way. So, we\u2019ve been super excited about it. And you should anticipate we\u2019ll do more of those as we start to explore that format. And then I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted to talk about from a content perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would just say there\u2019s been a few false starts on interactive storytelling in the last couple of decades. And I would tell you that this one has got storyteller salivating about the possibilities. So we\u2019ve been talking to a lot of folks about it and we\u2019re trying to figure it out too meaning is it novel, does it fit so perfectly in the Black Mirror world that it doesn\u2019t \u2013 it isn\u2019t a great indicator for how to do it, but we\u2019ve got a hunch that it works across all kinds of storytelling and some of the greatest storytellers in the world are excited to dig into it. To give you some sense that\u2019s over five hours of content that\u2019s produced for that episode for people to choose their own paths, and there\u2019s countless ways that they could go and end up with. And that is an incredible challenge and of usually exciting thing that differentiates Netflix for creators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think in that challenge is also an opportunity, right. It\u2019s an opportunity to bring technology to bear, to create a toolset for creators to make that process easier and more effective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric, there is one piece of data that didn\u2019t make the release and that\u2019s what percentage of people chose Frosties versus Sugar Puffs. The answer is 73% for Frosties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a level of data transparency. We have not seen our content yet\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It was critical data point of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Completely anecdotal, but the Sheridan House picked Frosties multiple times. So we fed into those numbers, my wife and I. Let\u2019s bring it all together. Now that we\u2019ve talked a little bit about a price increase subscriber trends, how money gets reinvested back into content. Spence, I\u2019d love to turn to you when say, when you think about the free cash flow profile of the business, some of the commentary in the letter around improving free cash flow from 2019 and beyond, how do you think about funding the business, the approach the business has always taken to the capital markets? Any perspective you have that you think might be different than in the past? Or do you think it\u2019s going to be steady as it goes? How are you thinking about sort of the funding in the capital structure side of the equation albeit new to the role?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So, well, first, we feel great about our content investment. It really is investment that is as even as you \u2013 as we talked about those viewing numbers and characteristics that speaks to at some degree the return on those content investments, the return on that capital. We feel really good about that as obviously the move to more owned content and production has pulled forward some of that spend relative to the former operating model or predominantly licensed model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that has put pressure on the cash flows of the business and cash needs of the business over the past few years, but when you saw on the letters that we \u2013 the negative cash flow in the business of roughly $3 billion in 2018, we\u2019re predicting sort of similar levels in 2019 and then to meaningfully improve that trajectory going forward. So that comes with driving the subscribers in the business, driving the revenues, driving the \u2013 scaling the margins in the business as we\u2019ve committed to from just 4% a couple of years ago to 10% last year and committing to 13% operating margins in 2019 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, this is a business with characteristics that that certainly allow for very healthy operating margins going forward. You can look at almost any benchmark of a comparable type of company. And so, we feel very good about the operating leverage in the business long-term, ultimately turning that into a much more positive contributor and conversion into cash flow. And ultimately, our aspiration is to be self-funding. And we believe we will do that over time with these content investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the interim, as we continue to need to access the markets, I don\u2019t foresee any change to our approach. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019ve accessed the debt markets to do that and we\u2019ll continue to do so. We think that that is the optimal cost of financing and funding to-date and we\u2019ll continue to pursue that path.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. too back on the price increase and the subscriber forecast for Q1, just want to make sure there is a clarification point. Number one, in the shareholder letter, you talked about the price increase going into effect during Q1 and Q2, if I remember correctly, the last time there was a price increase, it went into effect over a 12-month period. Maybe just to understand a little bit, what the mechanics are of the price increase, so people can understand some of the decision process behind that, maybe how it flows through the numbers in the first half of 2019?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I can take that Eric. So, with respect to the price changes, in the U.S., the new pricing goes into effect for new members, existing members will be phased in over the next several months. So, you\u2019ll see that impact over the course of the year and what that means is that will obviously impact the rate of net addition growth in the first half of the year. But commensurately, you also see ASP domestically improve over the course of the year and that\u2019s what we think will drive an acceleration in revenue growth over the course of 2019. And that\u2019s what also we believe drive operating margin higher sequentially over the course of the year to enable us to hit that 13% target for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe one followup that that came through from investors just thinking through the price increases, it was reported in \u2013 or speculated in the press over the last couple of days was how it might inform forward subscriber guidance, it looks like you\u2019re talking about U.S. paid net additions at a pretty similar level in Q1 versus Q4 and yet you are putting a price increase in place. The last time you did that, there was a fair bit of conservatism in the forward guide. How should we reconcile maybe the framework for guidance versus the price increase going into the marketplace? How should investors interpret that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Eric. I would say there\u2019s no change in terms of the guidance philosophy. And as we write every quarter, our approach is to strive for accuracy and our guidance forecast. And to do that, we take into account all the known variables that we\u2019re aware of when we set guidance. So, really it is our best guess and we\u2019re not by design trying to be overly conservative or overly aggressive, and we\u2019re really trying to be accurate with it. So that\u2019s the color I provide you with respect to that question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. 2018, which we talked about in the last interview and it has been a topic through the year was the year you framed as a company of testing and learning on the marketing front, possibly pivoting away from fewer subscriber acquisition, pivoting more towards spending money on the marketing side against your brand, individual pieces of content. What did you, as a company, learned this year as you went through that process about the way to allocate marketing dollars on a global scale to arrive at the most optimum outcome of subscriber additions, promoting brand, promoting content, driving engagement, and how should we apply those lessons as we think out to the way marketing might be a sort of trajectory through 2019 and beyond?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Almost all of our investments are promoting these incredible new titles we have like Bird Box. So that\u2019s our primary focus, at least on the paid marketing side. On the earned media side, it\u2019s broad. And then we have some straight acquisition targeted marketing that we also spend, but the bulk of it is around promoting the incredible new titles and getting them broadly launched.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And Greg maybe following up with you when not just when you think about marketing dollars, but also when you think about distributing the product broadly, I think this was a year 2018, where you struck a lot of partnerships to help on the distribution front, love to start with Greg, but love to have anyone chime in that feels they should on what some of those partnerships brought to the platform in 2018. How you think some of those partnerships are set up to aid platform awareness and distribution in 2019 and beyond, and how you think about the scalability for more of those partnerships when you look out over the next couple of years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Greg Peters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. And I think some has been here for a decade plus. it\u2019s sort of pulling that long thread of increasingly using partners in different ways to promote the service and to make it easier for members and members to be to sign up. So, we\u2019ve been doing partners for a long, long time. It\u2019s sort of been this March from integration on devices and just makes that a point to engage with the service to doing things like billing, on behalf of or we do billing integration. And now the latest sort of iteration that we\u2019re working with is, is bundling model, right. And so we\u2019re early on in that process, but I would say we\u2019re quite excited by the results that we\u2019re seeing. And I think mostly, it\u2019s because we believe it allows us to access a segment of consumers, who are big entertainment fans, but maybe, they\u2019re not as sort of technology forward or early adopters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, they haven\u2019t signed up with us directly. And so by putting Netflix on a set-top box, which are using to access a bunch of other video content and by including the Netflix subscription in a package of either their mobile subscription or pay-TV subscription, we can make it just super, super simple for those folks to get to know Netflix and to enjoy the kind of big shows that we\u2019re seeing like Bird Box, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I would anticipate we\u2019ll do more of those. We rolled out sky and free in Europe this quarter and we\u2019ve got more to come. but also worth noting that, we\u2019re going to grow that segment of the business, but it\u2019s small in terms of acquisition impact. It\u2019s nice supplemental channel, but it\u2019s smaller relative to the total organic subscriber acquisition that we have.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I could add back to your last question, Eric. Those distribution partners turned out to be great promoters of our content brands as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe, one followup, when you do those partnerships, has there been one avenue that\u2019s moved its needle more than another, whether it\u2019s in the home broadband space, partnering with infrastructure companies or on the multiple telephony front in promoting mobile usage and mobile engagement on the platform? Or have you\u2019ve seen roughly similar results irrespective of the type of partner?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say every market is different and every partner is different in terms of their goals and what they\u2019re \u2013 the message that they\u2019re communicating to their subscribers and how we can link that message with the Netflix message as well. but so nothing stands out thematically or sort of a general trend that I would say, but each one is incremental and so we look to do more of all kinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe going back to the shareholder letter, one phrase in the shareholder letter that Ted, I wanted to ask you about, the phrase less focused on second run programming. I think one of the big investor debates and questions around Netflix becomes what happens to licensed content that may come off the platform in 2019 and beyond. How you plan for that content coming off the platform? What it means for investments? What it means for engagement? Maybe reflect upon that statement in the shareholder letter and how it informs maybe the mix shift or the planning process for content as you look out to 2019 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, most of those licensing deals are multiyear. So, it gets \u2013 that gets caught up in our long-term content commitments. That\u2019s all part of those that content. remember our early investment in doing original content more than six years ago was betting that this would be, there would come a day when the studios and networks may opt not to license us content in favor of maybe creating their own services, which was \u2013 that\u2019s a corner that I\u2019m glad we saw around a few years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And today, I\u2019d say the vast majority of the content that is watched on Netflix are our original content brands. We do license a lot of second run content and in that we have a lot of episodes. So we have shows like Grey\u2019s Anatomy or Friends, we have hundreds of episodes. It\u2019s a lot of hours of watching, but that if you stack all those, all of that viewing, sort of like a top 50 or top 25 most watched shows by seasons or by series, that\u2019s dominated primarily by our original content brands. We are still a buyer in that second run market. We both are pre-buyer, been buying it before the shows come out and sometimes an aftermarket buyer, but it really is up to the sellers whether or not they want to continue to sell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And adding to Ted\u2019s comments, the top brands that we have, being originals like Bird Box are phenomenal and an unscripted now, it\u2019s our first category, where a majority of the viewing is a branded original, in the other categories we\u2019re climbing, not yet at a majority, but on track for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And two years ago, we didn\u2019t have any original unscripted content at all. So that\u2019s how fast that that those moves can take place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Eric, we\u2019ve also said we\u2019re not overly dependent on any one single piece of content as well. So, the viewing is quite diverse and as\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, through our originals as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s right. And as Ted mentioned, all of these licensed deals are staggered in sort of waterfall in over a period of time. So, there\u2019s no sort of cliff there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Waterfall and cliff, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ted Sarandos</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am on a roll.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spencer Neumann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe following up one more piece of the content side, one question that came into me as the moderator of this quarter in a couple of different ways was how to think about ownership of content versus co-production of content, what the right mix shift of that is medium-to-longer term, what\u2019s some of the pros or cons are of the approach of either doing co-production versus outright ownership and how we should think about that developing over the next couple of years?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the one thing is our main goal is to make the best content. And we\u2019ve said \u2013 we\u2019ve said in previous quarters that that is a combination of several different business models depending on who owns the IP. So, what we\u2019re going to do is make the best show and not be stuck on the business model, because the consumer really doesn\u2019t understand that or we even want to spend any time thinking about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So by way of example, last year, we had 140 different shows around the world that premiered on A network somewhere and on Netflix everywhere else in the world. next year, it\u2019s more to closer to 180. And these are combination of co-producing with local producers in other countries; it shows that then air on a network in that country and then premier on Netflix. But when I say co-production, I mean, we come in at the script stage, we come in at the first money stage, we\u2019re involved creatively with the production of that show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bodyguard is a good example of that, that we produced with ITV that the BBC premiered in the UK and that at the same time. we released it on Netflix around the world, and we produced it together at the script stage. We\u2019re involved in the production to that show and outside of the UK, it is a netflix original show and in the UK, we follow a broadcast window from the BBC. And again, we\u2019ve had a great success with the show around the world. One additional data point, we have over 23 million households have watched bodyguard in Netflix in the first four weeks and it\u2019s a good example of taking a show from anywhere in the world to the rest of the world. And we do other ones where we just are whereby territories. There use to be a tradition in television, where the network would make one show and then the \u2013 they take it to MACE \u2013 to the MACE screenings and try to sell market after market after market, that\u2019s less and less the case while we\u2019re working with producers and networks now to pre-buy or co-produce for the rest of the world. A similar evolution to the old studio film business, where the studios used to carry the international rights until they sold them and then they more frequently now go out and do international co-productions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Spence Neumann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Eric, I think we have time for one more question please.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Eric Sheridan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. And maybe turning it back to Reed, I think one of the more interesting sections in the shareholder letter, Reed, was you talked about the competitive landscape, big question, big debate. We get a lot from investors. You talked about it a lot of ways all ships rising, but talk a little bit about the landscape. What do you see out there on the landscape to attract user retention, user engagement, monetization, attract content creators, and how you think that competitive landscape will evolve and how do you think about navigating it from not only just 2019, but for the longer-term, Reed?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Reed Hastings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All ships rising as a little Pollyanna, optimistic, I think about it really is as winning time away, entertainment time from other activities. So, instead of doing Xbox or Fortnite or youTube or HBO or a long list, we want to win and provide a better experience. No advertising on demand. Incredible content. And so when you think of just the U.S. terms as an example. There\u2019s a billion hours of television content being consumed today, we\u2019re winning about 10% of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so that\u2019s why like Disney, they have great content, we\u2019re excited for their launch and maybe they grow over a couple of years to 50 million hours a day, but that\u2019s out of the billion. And so we compete so broadly with all of these different providers that any one provider entering, only makes a difference on the margin. And so again, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t get so focused on any one competitor and really think our best way is to win more time by having the best experiences, all the things we do. And that\u2019s helped us a lot. Another thing that\u2019s helped us a lot is having David Wells as our CFO for the last 10 years. It\u2019s been an incredible joyous partnership. And so to wrap up this call, I\u2019m going to turn it over to David Wells to come say goodbye.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Wells</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Surprise guest. So, Reed and the group was great to give me this sort of last word. Thank you. A giant thank you to our investors. I\u2019ve been here nearly 15 years. That\u2019s 51 quarters including this one with 32 as the CFO, a 1000% plus growth in the value of the company and I\u2019ve been a big part of that and I\u2019m really thankful and respectful for that. And I\u2019ve got just super high confidence in Spence. We spent a lot of time together. I think he\u2019s going be great for the next phase of Netflix growth so \u2013 and just really thanks. Thanks to all the investors. Thank you.</p>", "twitContent": "$NFLX - Netflix's (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings on Q4 2018 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4234177-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-on-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "97", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17933", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "586376", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17972", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/4234177-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-on-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4234177-netflixs-nflx-ceo-reed-hastings-on-q4-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
