Today I\u2019ll discuss our 2018 results as well as our outlook for 2019. For the full year 2018, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.88, representing 15% growth versus the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Strong performance across our businesses along with underlying margin expansion from \u2013 and our synergy capture from recent acquisitions enabled us to achieve EPS at the upper end of the initial guidance range we issued at the beginning of last year, despite unfavorable currency shifts as we progress through the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With our recent strategic shaping completed, our focus in 2018 was on running the company we built and the result was an excellent year by every measure. All four of our major businesses performed well, contributing to overall organic sales growth of more than 7%, which is above the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the same time, we generated operating cash flow of more than $6 billion, returning $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends, and announced the 14% increase in our dividend beginning this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also increased our investments and capabilities for the future, including expanding manufacturing capacity in two important areas that will drive significant long-term growth, FreeStyle Libre, our revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system and Alinity, our family of highly differentiated diagnostic systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And lastly, following two major acquisitions in 2017, we repaid more than a $8 billion of debt, which significantly enhances our strategic flexibility going forward. Our performance this past year demonstrates the strength of our strategy and execution, and for 2019, we\u2019re forecasting another year of strong financial performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% and adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25 reflecting double-digit growth. I\u2019ll now provide a brief overview of our 2018 results and 2019 outlook for each business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll start with Nutrition, where sales increased mid-single digits in 2018, reflecting a notable improvement in our growth rate versus the prior year. Sales growth this past year was well balanced across our pediatric and adult Nutrition businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Internationally, our focus on enhancing competitiveness with our well-known and trusted brands led to strong growth in both Asia and Latin America. In China, we saw improvement in both the market and our performance after the government transitioned to new food safety regulations in that country at the beginning of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in the U.S. growth was driven by our Pediatric Nutrition business, led by above market growth of Similac, our market leading infant formula brand and Pedialyte, our market leading rehydration brand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, the fundamental demographic and social economic trends in the global nutrition market remain favorable and our position in the market remains very competitive. In Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales grew 7% in 2018, led by double-digit growth in both India and China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our strategy in EPD is unique and quite simple, to build significant presence, scale and leadership positions in the most attractive emerging markets, where long-term growth in medicines will be driven by aging populations and the related rise in chronic diseases, increasing incomes and expanding access to care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We built our business over-time through a series of strategic steps to be powered globally, but driven locally. A global scale sets us apart and provides a unique competitive advantage versus local players, particularly when it comes to manufacturing and innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our local decision making allows us to be nimble and navigate the complexities of each country. Healthcare spending in most emerging markets is less than half that of developed markets, which means there\u2019s lots of room for future growth and our focus continues to be on strong execution across all elements of our business model to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Diagnostics, where we\u2019ve consistently achieved above market growth with our leading platforms. 2018 was no different with global organic sales growth of 7%. This past year was particularly important as we accelerated the launch of Alinity, our family of highly differentiated instruments in Europe and other international markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Customer feedback has been outstanding was quite frankly, isn\u2019t a surprise to us given that Alinity was designed based on countless hours of listening to and observing the needs of our customers. These systems are designed to be more efficient, running more tests in less space, generating results faster, minimizing human errors, while continuing to provide quality results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In 2019, while the international launch continues to gain momentum, we anticipate obtaining U.S. regulatory approvals for a critical mass of our test menu over the coming months, which will allow us to accelerate the launch of Alinity in the U.S. later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2018 was also an important year for our newly formed Rapid Diagnostics business. We achieved our sales and synergy targets for the year and are very pleased with the pace and progress of the integration of this business. We also made important advancements in our pipeline with new product launches in the areas of diabetes and cardiac care, as well as molecular rapid test for infectious diseases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These new products along with continued focus on strong execution across our portfolio will drive accelerated growth for this business going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And lastly, I\u2019ll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 9% in 2018, exceeding the initial guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. Strong growth this past year was led by several areas including electrophysiology, structural heart and diabetes care, as well as stabilization in our rhythm management and vascular businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In electrophysiology, growth of 20% was led by our heart mapping and ablation portfolio. During the year, we advanced our product portfolio in this area with the launch of our Advisor HD Catheter, which creates highly detailed maps of the heart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And earlier this week, we announced U.S. FDA approval of our innovative TactiCath Sensor Enabled Catheter, which will further strengthen our competitiveness in this highly under penetrated market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Structural Heart, 2018 was a landmark year for our business. We achieved double-digit growth and perhaps more importantly announced clinical trial results from MitraClip, our market leading device for the minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve was demonstrated improve survival and clinical outcomes in patients with the most prevalent form of this heart disease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We submitted this study data to the U.S. FDA during the fourth quarter to support consideration of an expanded indication for MitraClip. If approved, this advancement would further enhance our leadership position in this large and highly under penetrated disease area and offer the potential to create a new multi-billion dollar cardiac device market over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And lastly in Diabetes Care, we achieved growth of 35% in 2018, growth was led by FreeStyle Libre, which achieved global sales of more than a $1 billion, an increase of 100% versus the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we added 300,000 new users. As of the end of 2018, there are now approximately 1.3 million active users worldwide, of which approximately two-thirds are type 1 diabetics and one-third are type 2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In U.S. we saw an accelerating trend of new users as we ramped up our awareness efforts during the second half of the year, and pharmacy insurance coverage continue to increase including an emerging trend of seeing Libre granted preferred copay status versus competitive systems due to its compelling overall value proposition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Europe, during the fourth quarter, we initiated the launch of Libre 2.0, which includes optional alarms that one patients of glucose levels fall out of range. Due to our unique product design and highly automated manufacturing process, we\u2019re able to offer this feature to Libre users without increasing the cash pay price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This affordable and simple to use device is fundamentally changing the way people with diabetes manage their disease and given the fact that more than 400 million people are living with diabetes around the world, Libre promises to be a significant growth driver for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in summary, 2018 was another outstanding year for us. We achieved our strategic and financial objectives despite challenging currency shifts during the year. Our top tier performance demonstrates the strength of our strategy, our portfolio and our execution. And for 2019, we\u2019re forecasting continued strong organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to discuss our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook in a bit more detail. Brian?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brian Yoor</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Miles. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on an organic basis, which is consistent of our previous guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our results, sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.4% on an organic basis, in-line with our guidance of mid-to-high-single digit growth. Rapid Diagnostics, which was acquired in late 2017, and is therefore not included in our 2018 organic sales growth results achieved sales of $548 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on fourth quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen modestly, resulting in a somewhat larger unfavorable impact on our results in the fourth quarter compared to expectations, had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding other aspects of the P&amp;L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.3% of sales, adjusted R&amp;D investment was 7.2% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was 29.2% of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, as we look back at 2018, we delivered strong organic sales growth of more than 7%, adjusted earnings per share growth of 15%, and exceed our cash flow and debt repayment objectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our outlook for the full-year 2019. Today, we issued guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.15 to $3.25. For the full year, we forecast organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5%. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our full year reported sales with the vast majority of the impact expected to occur in the first half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of somewhat above 59.5% of sales for the full-year, which reflects underlying gross margin improvement across our businesses, partially offset by the impact of currency. We forecast adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 7.5% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of approximately 29.5% of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We forecast net interest expense of around $600 million and non-operating income of around $200 million. Lastly, we forecast an adjusted tax rate of around 15% for the full year 2019, which contemplate the anticipated impact from U.S. tax reform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we forecast adjusted EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange on our results. We forecast organic sales growth of a little less than 7%, which contemplates a difficult comparison versus the first quarter of last year when we saw abnormally strong sales in our Rapid Diagnostics business due to a record flu season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of around 5.5% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of around 58.5% of sales. Adjusted R&amp;D investment of around 7.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&amp;A expense of somewhat above 32% of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before we open the call for questions, I\u2019ll now provide a quick overview of our first quarter and full year organic sales growth outlook by business. For Established Pharmaceuticals, we forecast mid single-digit growth in the first quarter, which is comprised of mid to high single-digit growth in our priority key emerging markets along with a modest decline in other EPD sales, which reflects the recent discontinuation of a non-core low margin third-party supply agreement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, we forecast Established Pharmaceuticals growth of mid to high single-digits. In Nutrition, we forecast low to mid single-digit growth for both the first quarter and the full year. In Diagnostics, we forecast Abbott\u2019s Legacy diagnostics businesses, which is comprised of core laboratory, molecular and Point of Care to grow mid to high single-digits for both the first quarter and full year, driven by the continued strong sales momentum across our portfolio of instruments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Rapid Diagnostics, which will now be included in our organic sales growth results in 2019 is expected to be relatively flat in the first quarter, reflecting the difficult flu season comparison I mentioned earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, we forecast Rapid Diagnostics growth of low to mid single-digits. And at Medical Devices, we forecast high single-digit sales growth for both the first quarter and the full year, which reflects continued double-digit growth in several areas of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, we will now open the call for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thank you for taking the question. Wanted to ask about FreeStyle Libre to start off. You had another good quarter of patient adds and it seems like you\u2019re expanding more into type 2 with the new disclosure. Could you talk about the trends there, what\u2019s the 2.0 adds and some of your longer-term vision for Libre?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sure, Matt. Well, a few things about Libre or actually several things about Libre. First of all, it\u2019s going extremely well. We did add 300,000 patients last quarter. That\u2019s almost equivalent to the entire user base of the number two competitor in the space. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s going very well. We got over 1.3 million patients now. Two-thirds of those are type 1. Our intent with this device has been to serve the entire diabetic community and not niche it because we think it has mass-market potential worldwide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we target both segments, both type 1 and type 2. And we\u2019re doing very well in type 1 segment \u2013 the type 1 segment actually. And as our capacity expands, we\u2019ll put even more effort behind the expansion with type 2 patients. There\u2019s a constant, I would say, cadence of enhancements, et cetera, to the product. We\u2019ve recently launched 2.0 in Europe. That should come to the U.S. shortly. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously invested a fair bit in capacity expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And at the rate we\u2019re adding patients, obviously, that\u2019s something we started paying attention to a couple of years ago. And I\u2019d say, a significant quantum of capacity will come online in the second half of this year. And from my perspective, that allows us to open the floodgate much wider. At this point, we\u2019re having a tremendous amount of success with Libre without putting much push behind it. And at that point, we\u2019re going to have an ability to turn on a lot of push.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So \u2013 and then we\u2019ve got steady cadence of capacity additions after that. And because of the magnitude and the size of the diabetic market, both for type 1 diabetics and type 2 diabetics, our view was this had to have a value proposition for patients and for the health care system that was accessible and affordable by everybody and not just driven by a rebate system and so forth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019ve got a very low cost position. We\u2019ve got a good value access price point. And I think all of that is playing through our markets and our patient groups and influence groups and so forth very well. The product obviously is getting all the emphasis in development, et cetera, that anybody would like to see. I think this is a very big, long-term, sustainable growth product for the company. I don\u2019t have any other way to say it. This is a hell of a good topic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s been phenomenal growth. I was just curious, as you look forward in segmenting the market, you now have Libre 2 with alarms. You have partnership with a pump company. Can you talk about how you might bifurcate your strategy to go after different segments, whether you need low-cost offering and a higher feature offering as you kind of expand through the Libre portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think \u2013 I\u2019m going to be careful how much I say publicly on the phone. I think you can assume that we\u2019re obviously developing every aspect of this product that you can imagine. And that\u2019s all going very well. I wouldn\u2019t communicate what I would forecast as time lines. I think that the current growth rate speaks for itself. The current submissions and features of the product that we\u2019re adding speak for themselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re pretty highly focused on bringing that capacity online, and not because we\u2019re constrained yet, but right now, we\u2019re adding as, I said, 300,000 patients a quarter and growing. And so you have to pay attention to keeping that momentum increasing. And at this point, with that many patients and the magnitude of the opportunity, our intent is to make this very much a mass-market product. But with 40 million type 1 diabetics out there, mass market means every one of those type 1 diabetics ought to be able to access this product economically, and that\u2019s worldwide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then of course, there\u2019s an enormous type 2 market beyond that. So this is not a product that\u2019s targeted solely at type 1 or solely at type 2. Its accuracy and performance obviously has meaning and efficacy in all segments. Our cost position is as low as anything in the industry. We have probably number one cost position, number one volume of patients position. I think we can pretty easily declare ourselves the leader in continuous glucose monitoring and growing faster than everybody else.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019d just say that all of the things that you would expect us to be doing, including working with other third-party partners who would benefit from this technology, all underway, have been for some time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for the detailed answer. I\u2019ll let some others jump in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks for taking the question. Miles, maybe I can ask a guidance question. So Abbott\u2019s guidance for 2019 is 6.5% to 7.5%, basically in line with 2018 and a bit better than The Street was expecting to start the year. So maybe you could give us a little background what your confidence is at the starting point? And maybe specifically, touch on some of the key growth drivers for 2019 that people are focused on. MitraClip, you talked about Libre, and maybe hit on an Alinity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Well, I think you\u2019ve touched base there on several of them already. What you should read into that guidance is we had an outstanding 2018 and we just gave you guidance that\u2019s even better than 2018. And the underlying growth rates are strong. The pipelines are strong. It\u2019s all organic growth. It\u2019s not dependent on lapping an acquisition. It\u2019s not driven by lapping an acquisition. It\u2019s not dependent on acquiring something. And all the things that are driving our growth are coming right out of our own pipeline and launching globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if I take that a piece at a time, Libre as a story just gets better and better and better. So obviously, that\u2019s a pretty big and high growth driver. That\u2019s a good thing. The Alinity program has had an outstanding year rolling out in the Core Lab, which is primarily driven by Europe. And we haven\u2019t really unleashed it yet fully in the U.S. or even fully in Asian markets. And as that menu reaches what I\u2019ll call critical mass, that will tip up as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so far, everything we\u2019ve seen with the rollout in Europe has been exceptional. Our share capture, our retention of rolling over a lot of our own customers and our own installed base, our price point and value point were, I\u2019d say, extremely competitive but it\u2019s better than that. And so that\u2019s going well, and that momentum only gets better as we expand geographies. And frankly, there\u2019s a couple of aspects to that program that haven\u2019t really gone to market yet fully, our hematology piece, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think those are strong drivers. When we acquired Alere in the diagnostic space, it was a declining to slightly best \u2013 at best, flat business. And that\u2019s been a nice story for us in terms of integrating it. We\u2019re going to be looking for now improving the growth of the new product pipeline and momentum going forward in that business, which is incrementally positive for the business. As I already mentioned, Nutrition, compared to the prior four, five years, has a nice, steady, sustainable forward-looking growth in the, let\u2019s call it, 3% to 5% range, somewhere in there. And that\u2019s a plus, that\u2019s an upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The pipeline in devices is strong. It\u2019s good. I mean, we spoke earlier in the year about the COAPT trial driving MitraClip in Structural Heart. And there\u2019s a nice pipeline of products and enhancements coming behind that. We just launched or got approval for HeartMate 3 for destination therapy, some additional catheters in our Electrophysiology business that help us be even more competitive than the 20% growth rate we\u2019ve got now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just everything across the board gets better. Where do we see problems? Well, we got a couple of places that we\u2019re not too happy about our own performance in. We know neuromod is a super good growth business. We expect to see sequentially improving growth out of that business over the course of the year. I\u2019ve talked about that on previous calls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe we\u2019re in control of our destiny there. And if we \u2013 if anything, I had probably estimated the speed at which we could correct our direction there wrong. It\u2019s taken a little longer than I would have guessed. But that\u2019s going to get sequentially better, and I think that\u2019s a plus. The Point of Care business that\u2019s part of our Diagnostic business, not Alere but \u2013 our own Point of Care business, we had some corrections to make in our strategy, and we\u2019ve done that. And so I\u2019m quite optimistic that our management team there has a good path, a good management team, et cetera. That\u2019ll improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So if I had a concern at all, it\u2019s the things I can\u2019t control. I think our fundamental underlying strategy in the pharmaceutical business is solid. I think the underlying growth rates in emerging markets are solid. I know the world worries about the volatility of those markets and the reliability of those markets and, in particular, currency. And we\u2019re all going to live with currency if we\u2019re a multinational company, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re any different.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And to be honest, we\u2019re not that differently indexed now with the addition of the Medical Devices and Diagnostics and so forth in the company. So while we may have, let\u2019s call it, individual spotty circumstances in any given emerging market in any given year, which we kind of expect, I think the underlying growth of that business, driven by the development of those economies, the health care systems, is solid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I look at all aspects of the company. Whenever we\u2019re not performing where we think we should in a given business, we do take corrective steps. And as I look across the portfolio, every single business which had such a great year last year or actually have a little better one this year or a lot better one this year and on a sustainable basis going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as I look forward into 2019, I note that there\u2019s a lot of caution in the world about economies and any number of other things. We base our growth rates and our growth projections on our products. On the market dynamics we see in each of our product areas in the segments we compete in. And we\u2019ve got a rich portfolio of products right now and a rich portfolio of products coming out of our organic R&amp;D and a lot of longevity on the driving of those products in the market for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So whatever the windiness of the currency markets or other things may be, we\u2019ve demonstrated through 2018 and will demonstrate into 2019 that we can power through that and continue to deliver the kind of growth that our shareholders reliably expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, that\u2019s really helpful. And maybe one for Brian. On the bottom line, EPS guidance implies growth of 9% to 13% on a reported basis, closer to mid-teens on a constant currency basis. This is higher than what we\u2019ve seen in the past from Abbott but also off the higher starting top line. So as we go through the year, if there\u2019s incremental upside, how should investors think about the willingness to allow that to fall to the bottom line versus reinvesting in the business at these growth rates?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brian Yoor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll defer to Miles on that question because I know he makes the choices ultimately between the balance of growth and sustainable growth versus what we give back to shareholders. But I think we\u2019ve shown a good propensity to be balanced in that. We showed that demonstration even last year as we gave some pennies back to The Street when we had a variable tax rate but invested heavily in the growth opportunities that Miles talked about that creates the kind of sustainable growth that we\u2019re looking for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your math is right. I said back on the October call that exchange would be around 4% to the bottom line impact. It\u2019s just a little touch above 4%. You could imply that, that would mean about mid-teens EPS growth. And even as you look at our quarters, I mentioned in my script that FX would be more front-end loaded. It\u2019s a first half phenomenon. But underlying growth that we\u2019re portraying here for the first quarter and the full year is pretty rangebound in that underlying double-digit earnings per share growth of the mid-teens, plus or minus a couple of points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And there\u2019s a lot of underlying gross margin improvement still going on across our businesses. There\u2019s a lot of synergy still being captured in gross margins as well as in SG&amp;A as it pertains to our continued integration with St. Jude and also with Rapid Diagnostics. So you\u2019re seeing the margin expansion come through in our op margin line in our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019d reiterate a couple of things. So this is Miles. First of all, Brian mentioned, exchange, as we know it right now is factored into our guidance, and we\u2019re still at a double-digit EPS growth. The exchange that we\u2019re, I don\u2019t know, seeing in our guidance is a factor of last year, meaning 2018, that we\u2019ve got to lap. And so it\u2019s that roll-through that is currently taking us from what otherwise would have been 15% to what at the midpoint would be 11%. So we\u2019re still at healthy double digits, and it\u2019s in effect caused by lapping last year\u2019s guidance. None of us are currency traders, so there\u2019s no way to kind of predict what\u2019s going to happen with the year, and I hesitate to do so for fear that fate strike us down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But with regard to profits and performance and so forth, I\u2019d say the company has always been fortunate that it\u2019s had strong profits and strong cash flow. And with regard to forecasting and so forth, we start every year with a double-digit target and a high bar, and that\u2019s our aspiration every single year. And gosh, more often than not, that\u2019s where we start with our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now having said that, out of the last 11 years \u2013 and why do I not go back further than 11 years? I don\u2019t have the data, but I could get it. But in out of the last 44 quarters that we have reported, we have beat 39 of them, exceeded the investors\u2019 expectations, beat 39 of them and met on five. And so I think the company has demonstrated that if it exceeds its expectations, if it exceeds Wall Street\u2019s expectations, if it exceeds in performance, we do share that back to our investors in increased profitability or increased return to the investor. And there\u2019s no reason to see a change to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve got strong cash flow. We are able to cover all of our cash and investment needs from a capital standpoint, from a dividend standpoint. We have the capacity to buy back shares to offset dilution and, frankly, buy back shares it\u2019s the best investment that we can make. We have the capacity to do M&amp;A. We\u2019ve obviously been able to pay down a lot of debt and very, very rapidly so that we would have the balance sheet flexibility that we want.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we had very strong performance, strong profitability, strong cash flow. And so if we exceed our expectations and our performance, then obviously, we have the decision \u2013 and that\u2019s a nice place to be. We have the decision to share that with our investors, which is exactly what our investors would expect. And you can tell that 90% of the quarters for the last 11 years, investors are benefited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Miles, just a couple for you. In thinking about or listening to your commentary on 2019, the one comment that comes to mind was balance, your commentary that most businesses get better or a lot better. That being said, a lot of investors are still very focused on Libre and MitraClip. So as you think about the guidance and how it was formulated, how dependent is 2019 guidance on a significant inflection for MitraClip or a Libre 2 product launch?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Zero.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. That\u2019s pretty clear. I guess we can leave it at that. The second point\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, it is. I mean, you know what? I think I need to be honest, I\u2019m not trying to be coy with you. It\u2019s very hard to predict what the regulatory timing will be, for example, on MitraClip. So \u2013 and there\u2019s no reason for us to come play with the number and play with something that we\u2019re not sure we can predict. So what we do know is when it comes, which is very compelling \u2013 there\u2019s a number of things that have to happen. FDA has to approve it. We obviously would want CMS to reimburse it and so on. And I think it\u2019ll have that kind of compelling story with the regulatory bodies. It\u2019s obviously \u2013 the COAPT study was very powerful, and I think the regulatory bodies will give that all the right consideration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But trying to pin that down and trying to pin down timing and so forth is not something that\u2019s easy to do. And I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d be doing our investors any good service by trying to predict that. What I do know is it\u2019s compelling. When it comes, it\u2019ll come and it\u2019ll have impact. And rather than put it in our estimates, we haven\u2019t.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, very clear. And then just following up on another point you made in this morning. Thinking about the balance sheet, I mean, you went from two years ago an overlevered company to now, frankly, relative to peers an underlevered company. I think debt paydown and free cash generation were sort of unsung heroes of last year. So many of other companies have picked up the relative pace of M&amp;A. You\u2019re still growing at a pretty robust 7-plus percent rate without significant M&amp;A in the last couple of years. So where do you stand now as you think about reinvestment for growth? How active are you likely to be in 2019 relative to 2018 on the M&amp;A front?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I\u2019d say a couple of things. First of all, you earn your highest return on organic growth and not your highest return on M&amp;A. And then I mean, as you know, a lot of M&amp;A deals struggle to return a good return to shareholders. We\u2019ve had, let\u2019s say, an excellent track record going back deep in our history with Knoll and Humira and so forth, we\u2019ve had a really good track record with the M&amp;A we\u2019ve done over time. And we\u2019ve managed those companies and their products well over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019d say, first of all, you make much higher return on your organic growth. The growth we\u2019re getting from all of our businesses and even St. Jude is coming out of pipeline, and it\u2019s coming out of our own organic development, et cetera. And right now, those are the highest returns, those are the highest, biggest opportunities, and we certainly don\u2019t see gaps right now that we have to fill with M&amp;A. So we\u2019re able to return a pretty good sales and profit growth rate across the business. We\u2019ve also been careful over time, there\u2019s times to be in the M&amp;A markets and there\u2019s times not to be. And when multiples are really high, bad time to buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And \u2013 but to be honest, I don\u2019t see anything right now that is so appealing that we feel like that\u2019s necessarily good direction for us. And the kinds of things we might look at, well, I would never tell you anyway, and you know that. But right now, our opportunities are so good with our own organic products and execution that we don\u2019t need it. And there\u2019s not something that\u2019s so attractive. All of the various investment banking houses that you can imagine have put many things in front of us as opportunities as they do every company, et cetera. So it\u2019s not like we\u2019re not aware of what opportunities may be out there. It\u2019s just they wouldn\u2019t meet our criteria. I don\u2019t see something compelling. I don\u2019t see something that we need. And right now, we\u2019re in a fortunate position where we\u2019ve got very strong products and pipelines and strategies across all of our businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will say we can execute better in some places, but you can\u2019t buy that. So we fix our own execution with our talent and strategies and so forth. But it\u2019s just not necessary for us to put our money into M&amp;A right now because I don\u2019t think we\u2019d turn a better return for our shareholders now or at least in the foreseeable future doing that. We\u2019re going to make a lot more money for our shareholders, investing in our growth, investing in the products we have, investing in our expansion, investing in our own capital. And as you know, we have plenty of cash flow to do that, and we have plenty of cash flow that we can still return increasing dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And at some point here, we\u2019ll have a choice. We\u2019re going to keep paying down debt because I think it\u2019s a good idea. Our debt \u2013 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio now is below 2, and as you know, it was more like 4 to 4.3 when we completed the Alere and St. Jude deals. That wasn\u2019t that long ago. So to have brought our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down that far and that fast, and particularly, as we look forward in a rising interest rate environment or potentially so, depending on what you believe, I think we\u2019re doing the right things in the management of our balance sheet. I wanted to get that debt down fast; we have. I wanted to have strategic flexibility; we have it. What I really want is capital allocation flexibility to earn the right returns and the optimal returns for our shareholders, and I think we\u2019re in that position. So I just don\u2019t see M&amp;A right now as a high priority.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Lewis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Very clear. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thanks, Miles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking the question. I\u2019m going to take the flip side of David\u2019s question. Instead of thinking about M&amp;A and adding things, how do you feel about having all four legs of the stool remain in the Abbott house? I think there was some lay press discussion regarding a possible sale of a nutritionals business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I guess that\u2019s speculation. Geez, if I don\u2019t get it every quarter \u2013 it\u2019s almost every quarter. So thanks for asking the question, Joanne. We like our mix right now. There\u2019s a role to everything in our portfolio. And the one I\u2019m asked more frequently about than anything is Nutrition. And you can transact, you can try to make money for your shareholders with transactions, but I would say this; as you know, Joanne, I\u2019ve been in this job a long time. And earlier in my tenure, there was a role for Nutrition in our portfolio. And I got the same question then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one of the roles was it\u2019s got a global presence, global infrastructure. It\u2019s highly profitable, generates a lot of cash. And a lot of the M&amp;A activities and other things that we did back in my earlier years benefited from the cash flows and position of Nutrition. And even today, there are great benefits to our Nutrition business to the company. And that\u2019s not to say that any given part of the company has to be part of it. It\u2019s clearly a different business as is our pharmaceutical business, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But today, I\u2019d say, look, it makes sense as part of our company. I don\u2019t think we need to be considering a transaction just to do it. We\u2019re well valued. We\u2019re performing well. I don\u2019t honestly think I would create more value for our investors by separating it. If everybody asks you about it often enough, you go look at it. Okay, I\u2019ve looked at it. I don\u2019t think we can create differential improved value for our shareholders than what is already being executed by us. I think that\u2019s a plus. I think that in general, while a lot of people might ask me about it, it\u2019s also performing well. I\u2019m happy that it\u2019s performing a lot better than it did for a couple of years there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it\u2019s just not on my radar screen. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to improve Abbott. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to create value by considering it. And I think we\u2019ll distract ourselves with that at a time we don\u2019t even need to be distracted. So it\u2019s just not on my radar screen as a way to create value for shareholders because I don\u2019t think it will. And I think it\u2019s being well valued as part of Abbott as is the rest of Abbott. So it\u2019s just not on my radar screen and nor do I think it\u2019s necessarily beneficial to us. I guess that\u2019s the simplest thing to say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, appreciate that. As a follow-up, two businesses I just want to talk about the pipeline. Neuromod, what does it take to reaccelerate that growth rate? And then you talked about an Alere pipeline, which I don\u2019t think The Street is really focused on. If you could just give us some highlights there. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So first of all, the single biggest thing that immediately will change how we\u2019re doing in neuromod is actually our sales force expansion in the U.S. and our training and execution there. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Then longer term, we put a lot of emphasis in our R&amp;D pipeline. We have a number of new people, new management, broader pipeline under development. I\u2019m not going to give you any kind of insights to and so forth because I don\u2019t really want to get the world focused on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it\u2019s an area where we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in the types of products we have. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ve sort of fully gotten the benefit of the two main products we have now. And so I\u2019d say it\u2019s got our attention. We doubled our investment in R&amp;D there. And I think in the coming years, we\u2019ll see that roll out. What was the second part of that for neuromod?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pipeline in Alere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve reorganized the Rapid Diagnostics business into four segments. Each of them has their emphasis, their target. Each has an R&amp;D plan. Each has a new product plan. We are increasing our investment in R&amp;D also there. I can give you a couple of high points and examples. Infectious decease product, i.e. now, which we think its got a lot of potential that we\u2019re rolling out. The Afinion 2 cardiometabolic platform, another opportunity that we\u2019re putting emphasis behind. But I think there\u2019s \u2013 generally speaking, there\u2019s a lot more possibility for us in incrementally updating and renewing a number of these platforms, and then there\u2019s newer stuff than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so when we took over the company, which we\u2019ve now had in our possession a little over a year, one of our targets was to get our hands around the R&amp;D of each of these segments and make sure we had an R&amp;D plan in place, so there was a steady cadence of improvements and new products in each of these businesses. That does take a little time. In our first year, a lot of our focus was stabilizing the organization, its structure, the management, people, execution of what we\u2019ve got, synergies, et cetera, which we\u2019ve talked about. Now our attention turns to this, and it has been. I mean, we\u2019ve been increasing our spending and increasing our focus on this. And that\u2019s what the management team is focused on now, is that new product cadence. So beyond that, I don\u2019t want to be more specific. Otherwise, we\u2019ll be tracking it all here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well. Thanks and good morning. Just wanted to follow up, if I might, the commentary earlier on MitraClip given its visibility. Can you just give us a sense as to what the growth rate of MitraClip was in the fourth quarter? And then to be clear, relative to your earlier comments, do you really not assume U.S. approval and reimbursement for MitraClip in FMR at all in 2019? Is that not assumed at all?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, that\u2019s not what I said, and that\u2019s not what the question was. I\u2019m not assuming that. But the question was whether or not that was pivotal to making our earnings guidance for the year or our sales guidance. And the answer was, it has no bearing on our sales and earnings guidance for the year. But you\u2019re asking me a different question now, do I expect approval? And I\u2019d say, well, we\u2019ll see. I mean, we\u2019re certainly hopeful that we\u2019ll get that kind of consideration. And is it possible? I suppose it\u2019s possible, but we don\u2019t know. We just don\u2019t know. Scott?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. With respect to the MitraClip growth rate, MitraClip grew about 30% in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. So it accelerated a little bit. Okay, I hear you on MitraClip. And then the other sort of product-oriented question that I wanted to ask is that you mentioned in your remarks that Libre is getting some preferred copay status. And I was just \u2013 I found that intriguing. I was just wondering if you could expand on what that means specifically, how broad the program is, is that just because Libre is a little lower cost? Or are payers trying to incentivize patients to use Libre? So maybe just a little color on the copay status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I mean, as you think about copay status and the way payers use it, that is essentially what we\u2019re trying to do, is we\u2019re trying to incent a preferred offering with respect to the value proposition that, that offering brings. So as we progress in the second half of the year in our payer dialogue, we saw that certain payers were starting to put Libre in a higher Tier 2, which would result for the end patient in a lower copay, quite frankly. And again, I think as they look at the overall value proposition, the outcomes data and whatnot, they see a compelling argument to do it, and we\u2019re starting to see that trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Navarro</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning, guys. Two device questions. First, on Rhythm Management in the quarter, down 2% to 3%. Is that market softness? Or are you guys just losing share to Boston Scientific because of their HeartLogic feature or losing share to Medtronic because they\u2019ve got Micra, the leadless pacer? So that\u2019s the first question. And then the Vascular business, down 5% in the U.S. That would \u2013 that\u2019s surprising to me given you\u2019re launching XIENCE Sierra. So similar question, is this just the market is weaker in drug-eluting stents for the U.S.? Is it more pricing pressure? Or is the product simply not gaining traction?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, Glenn. Yes. I\u2019ll start with Rhythm Management here. And as you know, when we acquired that business, it was declining at a fairly heavy clip. We\u2019ve been able to stabilize it. The overall market, to your point, is down modestly, and our performance is generally in line with that. When it comes to Vascular, same thing. Again, the market is down modestly. XIENCE Sierra is doing well. It\u2019s capturing share. In fact, we gained about five share points since the launch of XIENCE Sierra. Pricing in the space remains a challenge for all of the market, but XIENCE Sierra is definitely performing there. And quite frankly, our performance overall is a little bit above the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Glenn, what you\u2019re also seeing there is a reduction in third-party royalty revenue, not share. The stent and the system, XIENCE Sierra, are capturing share, but what you\u2019re seeing is the roll-through of loss of a third-party revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Navarro</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And one follow-up. Can you give us an update on both your TAVR and mitral program? TAVR, specifically Portico, when do we see a U.S. filing and approval? And then mitral, update on Tendyne enrollment and then maybe comment on the latest acquisition. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. On TAVR, we would expect to file that here in the second half of this year. We\u2019re wrapping up that trial as we speak. With respect to Tendyne and Cephea, obviously, we\u2019re expanding them. We\u2019ve had a long-term vision here in the mitral space to really build a toolbox. Tendyne, we filed actually for CE Mark before the end of last year. So we could possibly see approval here this year. The U.S. is still several years away. And the Cephea program looks like a really great program, but again, still several years away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Navarro</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great. Thanks, Scott.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, operator. We will take one more question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our final question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning, Miles. Maybe just one big picture and one product question. Brian has done and the team has done a fabulous job paying down debt. You highlighted some thoughts about the \u2013 your comfort in not doing M&amp;A in today\u2019s portfolio. Obviously, that suggests share buyback and dividend. You\u2019ve touched on it a little bit. But just wondering, are you feeling strongly about taking your excess cash and dividing it equally depending on stock price? I mean, do you have a priority? Is there some \u2013 how are you thinking about it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I don\u2019t think about it as dividing it equally. There\u2019s \u2013 for any particular capital use, there\u2019s a timing, and there\u2019s \u2013 or there\u2019s a need. If we got to invest in capacity internally and manufacturing and so forth, obviously, that\u2019s a good thing. And as I\u2019ve said, we can afford all of that and more. We\u2019re keeping our dividend healthy. We target our dividend generally in a range 40% or higher of our EPS as a payout ratio, a nice healthy range. And a number of our peer group don\u2019t do that at all. So I think we\u2019ve got a good healthy dividend. And that matters to us because we have a large segment of investors that care about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to M&amp;A, M&amp;A is necessarily opportunistic. It depends on the product, the company, the business, the timing, market values, multiple, all sorts of things. And right now, I don\u2019t see any of that lining up to say, wow, there\u2019s something we\u2019re dying to go look at. And then with regard to share buybacks, Rick, it sort of depends on valuations in the market. There\u2019s times when share buybacks aren\u2019t that economical and other times when they\u2019re high return. And on our case, right now, we\u2019ve got the flexibility. If we want to do any kind of share buyback just to offset dilution and so forth, we can do that. And \u2013 but I think you kind of \u2013 you got to look at it and say, is that my best use of cash? I still want to pay down debt. I don\u2019t want to assume we\u2019re just going to carry this forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We paid down a lot of debt fast. It would actually be in our interest to keep doing that, to keep paying it down. I think we\u2019re well into a reasonable range now of debt, but we still want to keep paying that debt down. And our cash flow is strong enough that we do have choice. We do \u2013 we have the ability to pay the dividend. We have the ability to do all these things. We can satisfy our capital needs internally. So I think \u2013 I guess the best thing about it is we don\u2019t think about it in any mechanistic or formula way, dividing it in half or whatever. We kind of look at where the best \u2013 where the need is and where the best return is. And I think it behooves us to leave ourselves also in a very strong position and a lower debt level. So we got places to use it and places to use it economically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When \u2013 before tax reform, when so much cash was trapped overseas, we were fortunate that we had M&amp;A opportunities to invest that cash for good return. We\u2019re not stuck like that now. We can manage cash, manage the cash flows of the company and so forth far more efficiently in terms of the best returns or the best needs. And that\u2019s kind of how we look at it. If we find that our best use of the cash or a strong use of the cash is share buybacks, we\u2019d certainly consider that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But right now, I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s our highest priority either. It\u2019s still a high priority to just keep paying down the debt. And a couple of years down the road here, depending on what happens with interest rates and so forth, we\u2019d probably be glad we did, and we\u2019ll have tremendous strategic flexibility and still have very strong cash flow. So I think it just depends on circumstances at a given point in time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, that\u2019s a great answer. And just lastly quickly, and I know you would love to talk about what could push you to the upper end of your 6.5% to 7% guidance for 2019. But there were some wild cards that helped out. You exceeded your initial 2018 organic growth guidance in 2018. Maybe just touch on quickly, if you would, what could push you to the upper end or above for your 2019 range?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Miles White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Oh, I think there\u2019s \u2013 Rick, I think there\u2019s a number of product things that could do that. We\u2019ve already mentioned MitraClip\u2019s possibility. And it wouldn\u2019t take a whole lot, a couple of ticks in any of these businesses of improvement. Last year, our Nutrition business actually did better than we expected. We thought it would do better than prior years, but it did better than that and better than we expected. And some of those tick-ups make a big difference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I think if we turn the corner as we expect to and plan to, things like neuromod and other places where we know the fundamental underlying business is strong, it doesn\u2019t take a whole lot to sort of correct the underperformance of some businesses, whether it\u2019s our Point of Care business or neuromod or some of individual countries in the pharmaceutical business. And the upside here is fairly strong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rick Wise</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Much appreciated. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Leinenweber</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Very good.
