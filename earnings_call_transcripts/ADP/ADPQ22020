I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].</p> <p>I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p> <p><strong>Christian Greyenbuhl</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site and our Investor Relations Web site at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.</p> <p>During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I turn the call over to Carlos, I\u2019d like to remind you of our upcoming Innovation Day which is scheduled for February 10. We hope to see many of you there in person and for those who are unable to attend, you can find more details about how to view the event at investors.adp.com. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing our progress on our investments and innovation as well as our vision for our HCM technology portfolio. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carlos Rodriguez</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter, up 5% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter and was also slightly ahead of our expectations. Together with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, these results helped us deliver 13% adjusted EPS growth in this quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our progress through the first half of fiscal 2020 following a difficult compare with the first half of fiscal 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to operations and starting with new business bookings. This quarter, we continue to see strength in our Employer Services downmarket offerings and solid progress on the sales of our Workforce Now solutions. We were also particularly pleased to see strong double-digit bookings growth in our PEO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that said, we are disappointed with our 3% Employer Services new business bookings growth for the quarter. This lower than expected growth was mainly the result of the same trends we saw in the first quarter with our international and multinational businesses, including delayed decisions for some of our larger multinational sales opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we have said before, given their size, these opportunities can have an outsized impact on our quarterly booking metric. With this in mind, we have narrowed our full year Employer Services new business bookings outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth as compared to our previous guidance of 6% to 8% growth on last year\u2019s 1.6 billion of Employer Services new business bookings. We continue to have a solid pipeline of opportunities and we remain confident in our ability to execute across our portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at client service, we continue to see good progress with overall strength in our net promoter scores and retention. As a result, we continue to expect our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 Employer Services revenue retention to increase 10 to 20 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now we\u2019re halfway to fiscal 2020 and at the midpoint of our three-year targets we outlined at our June 2018 Investor Day. As we are also six months away from giving our fiscal 2021 guidance and we will not be giving any updated financial outlook at our upcoming Innovation Day, I want to take a few moments here to look back and share my thoughts on our progress since we provided that guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s start with new business bookings. You will recall that our June 2018 Investor Day, we outlined that we were targeting growth for worldwide new business bookings growth of 7% to 9% through 2021. Though we no longer regularly report a worldwide bookings figure, which as a reminder includes the results of Employer Services and PEO segments together, we thought it would helpful in that context of a midpoint look back to share that we have seen 8% average quarter growth since the beginning of fiscal 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are pleased with this worldwide bookings growth together with our improvements in Employer Services revenue retention and how they demonstrate the strength and stability of our business even as we\u2019ve been going through meaningful transformation as an organization with a set of broad-based initiatives, including our Service Alignment Initiative in fiscal years 2017 and '18, our Voluntary Early Retirement Program in fiscal 2019 and most recently our Workforce Optimization and Procurement initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Meanwhile, our quarterly average consolidated revenue grew 6% reported and organic constant currency over the past 18 months. As we look at some of the developments that have affected our recent growth relative to our expectations, we note that our PEO has not performed in line with our long-term expectations driven by lower than expected pass-through revenues and lower than planned worksite employee growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past several quarters, we have discussed some of the factors impacting PEO revenue growth, including the impacts from our sales incentives, recent retention unfavorability related to healthcare inflation and softness in workers\u2019 compensation and state unemployment insurance rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With the impact of these factors, our average growth over the past 18 months in average worksite employees was 8% as compared to our long-term expectation of 9% to 11%. And a contribution to revenue growth from pass-throughs was 1% compared to our long-term expectation of 1% to 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Despite the slight underperformance relative to our expectations, we are confident in the overall prospects of the PEO business and continue to see healthy demand for our offerings. Our PEO platform is the leading fully outsourced solution in the HCM market and we combine this with best-in-class HR business partners, which together helps deliver an unparalleled service experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Stepping back now to total revenue, we are tracking at 6% average growth through six quarters. We have a solid playbook with a proven track record of driving sustained growth and we\u2019ll continue to focus on delivering consistent strong bookings growth and retention performance as key priorities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And moving down the P&amp;L, during this period we further solidified the foundations of our business as our associates continue to transform the way we work while also delivering innovative solutions to our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These transformation efforts along with our steady top line growth and the operating leverage in our model have helped deliver robust margin expansion and an average adjusted EBIT growth of 13% through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which is within the range of our fiscal 2021 target CAGR of 12.5% to 15.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This together with our disciplined share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate has driven adjusted EPS growth of 18%, which is tracking ahead of our targeted growth of 14.5% to 17.5% through fiscal 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can tell from our guidance for fiscal 2020, we currently anticipate ending the year within our fiscal 2021 three-year margin target range, one year ahead of schedule. This is no small accomplishment given our ongoing efforts to invest in the business for the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to date. The journey that we have embarked upon to simplify how we work, drive innovation and grow our business is a challenging one. However and more importantly, it is also providing us with great opportunities to demonstrate the value of our offerings to our clients as we continue to simplify the client experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through these collective efforts and with the continued strength of both our R&amp;D organization and our worldwide sales force, we are enhancing the depth and scale of our ability to serve our clients wherever they do business with best-in-class products and solutions that fit their needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our clients in turn are recognizing these efforts as we continue to see improvements in both our net promoter scores as well as in our Employer Services revenue retention. It is due to the success of these efforts that we remain committed to additional shareholder friendly actions such as our recent dividend increases of nearly 45% over the past two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our track record of annual increases in our dividend puts us in a small minority with 30 other companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have also grown their dividend for 45 consecutive years or more. As we look forward to the future, we remain confident that our strategy is the right one as we aim to further strengthen our resilient business model in order to drive sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I turn it over to Kathleen for a detailed financial review, I want you to know how proud I am of the external recognitions that we received this quarter which reflect the strong corporate culture on which our business is built. As I reflect on our recent efforts, I'm especially proud that FORTUNE magazine again name us to their most admired companies list for the 14th consecutive time and also rank us number one in our sector. This is a remarkable achievement and a rewarding recognition for the efforts of our associates who are focused on providing our clients the best solutions both for today and for the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I am also particularly pleased to see our efforts reflected in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Drucker Institute list of best managed companies where we were one of the biggest movers jumping 104 places into the top quartile. These are only some of the great recognitions that we are receiving for our efforts to create opportunities for all of our stakeholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen for her commentary on our results and the fiscal 2020 outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Kathleen Winters</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with our continued progress in delivering growth for our shareholders and this quarter was no exception. This quarter\u2019s reported revenue growth of 5% and 6% organic constant currency is slightly ahead of our expectations and we\u2019re particularly pleased given the difficult compare to our second quarter of fiscal 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our adjusted EBIT increased 9% and adjusted EBIT margin was up 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, both also slightly ahead of expectations due to the timing of our progress across our multiple transformation initiative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our margin improvement continues to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiative and operating efficiencies. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses and amortization expense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similar to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we\u2019re particularly pleased with our margin performance given the difficult compare that we faced in the first half of the year resulting from the outsized benefits in fiscal 2019 related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 260 basis points to 22% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is in line with our expectations and was mainly due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carry forwards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Adjusted diluting earnings per share grew 13% to $1.52 and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower adjusted effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to Employer Services segment and interest on funds held for clients, Employer Services revenues were slightly ahead of expectations and grew 4% reported and organic constant currency. Interest income on client funds grew 7% and benefited from growth in average client funds balances of 6% to 25.1 billion. This growth in balances continues to be driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.2% for the second quarter. Employer Services margins increased 30 basis points in the quarter driven by the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our PEO segment revenues grew 9% for the quarter to 1.1 billion and average worksite employees grew 6% to 579,000. Revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 7% to 412 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our value proposition in the PEO remains strong as evidenced by our double-digit PEO new business bookings growth this quarter. Our midmarket sales channel continues to grow following the realignment of our sales incentives and we\u2019re seeing continued signs of positive traction within our downmarket referral channel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With these factors in mind, we remain optimistic in our ability to reaccelerate the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Margins in the PEO decreased about 30 basis points for the quarter largely due to a difficult compare and an increase in selling expenses resulted from our strong quarterly new business bookings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with the PEO. With six months behind us now and our year-to-day average worksite employee growth and revenues tracking slightly below our expectations, we do not expect to achieve the higher end of our previous guidance range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As such, we are narrowing our guidance and now expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 8% growth in PEO revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 8% in average worksite employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments at ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on, let\u2019s take a look at Employer Services. We are narrowing our guidance to 4% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4% to 5% driven by a combination of continued unfavorability in FX and interest rates relative to our expectations coming into the year, and the lower bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We meanwhile continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5% and Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 to 20 basis points. And we now expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 7%. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 to 125 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now anticipate total revenue growth of about 6% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6% to 7%. This revenue outlook continues to assume an elevated level of FX on favorability for fiscal 2020 relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to anticipate our growth in average client fund balances to be about 4%, the average yield earned on our client fund investments to be about 2.2% and interest income on client funds to be between 570 million to 580 million. We also continue to expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be 575 million to 585 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 to 125 basis points. As a reminder, this guidance also continues to contemplate approximately 100 million in cost savings for fiscal 2020 related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.2%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not, however, include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that shortly after our February 10 Innovation Day, Christian will be moving on to take an international assignment as the General Manager of one of our European businesses. I want to thank Christian for his many contributions leading our Investor Relations program and also welcomed Danyal Hussain who many of you already know as our new Head of Investor Relations. Congratulations to both of you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin McVeigh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks. I think one of the things we\u2019ve been focused on is the retention \u2013 the improvement in the retention. Can you give us any sense of how kind of the first half scaled relative to the full year guidance?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think you can tell from our comments that it obviously improved in the second quarter and we\u2019ve tried to get away from \u2013 with the new guidance that we started providing I think was a year ago, we\u2019re trying to get away from quarterly guidance but we are still committed to giving you kind of a sense of kind of where we are. And I think you can tell from my prepared comments that we had a good first quarter and we also had a good second quarter. So retention is definitely a positive for us like we talked about last year in terms of some of the bright spots, our midmarket business retention continues to improve and is on track to really get through this year close to record levels. So it\u2019s very satisfying because we went through a very difficult time back in the day where we did all of the client upgrades and migrations and then with ACA at the same time, that was a business where we really had a real step back of retention. By the way, step back for us is a couple percentage points. Now we have recovered all of that and are kind of on track to get back to kind of where we were at record levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin McVeigh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. And then just --</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry, another comment was I think we also in the first half have had good retention in the upmarket which was another place it\u2019s been kind of a challenge for us over the last couple of years. So I think both of those businesses \u2013 when you combine them, they are a significant portion of our revenues and I think have a solid retention performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin McVeigh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s super helpful. As a quick follow up, despite the revenue adjustment, seems like you\u2019re maintaining the margin guidance. I guess what\u2019s driving that outperformance given kind of the revenue adjustments in the PEO and I guess overall?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have \u2013 our business model is interesting because sometimes at least for the first half as you could tell we\u2019re hoping and planning on a recovery in terms of our sales results for the second half. But in general we benefitted in the first half from an expense standpoint from having weaker new business bookings, because as you know our business has a little bit of a soft adjusting factor. Now the new 606 rules I think when you amortize some of these costs over time, they blunt some of that impact but there\u2019s still some impact from that. So we did benefit from that and we just have a lot of good things going on from a margin standpoint. We really want to make sure that we focus on the growth as well, but we feel pretty good about the initiatives that we put in place call it last fiscal year that are impacting this year\u2019s cost structure. And I think those \u2013 we talked about those as procurement initiatives, also the workforce optimization which was a delayering exercise where we reduced spends and control, so we took three layers out and increased spends across the board including all the way at the very highest levels where we had for us I would call it a significant decrease in overhead, if you will, in terms of \u2013 at our more senior levels. And so I think we\u2019re benefitting from all of those items and that\u2019s helping the margin. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of cost and margin. We have a lot of transformation initiatives around cost and margins and obviously we want to make sure that we focus on growth and new business bookings as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Not too much to add to that. Carlos has covered a lot of the points, but we\u2019re seeing the operating efficiency come through. We\u2019re executing on the transformation projects that we have in flight right now. Saw a little bit better than expected margin expansion in the second quarter, primarily some timing on some of the transformation work. But look, the teams executing really nicely on that, particularly on the procurement side and we\u2019re focused on continuing to do that and building the pipeline of additional opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just one little item in terms of color, you\u2019ll see from the Q that credit to the organization \u2013 again, a lot of these transformation initiatives have been \u2013 some of them when we talk about them, they\u2019re the big ones. We have dozens of other initiatives that are really improving the way we work automating things, taking out kind of non-value-added work. And when you look at our Q, you\u2019ll see that really R&amp;D and selling expense that have increased and we really are holding the line on the rest of our operating expenses due in large part to some of these initiatives that we have underway that are making work a little bit easier for our associates and also taking some of the work out. And so that\u2019s the key because we want to make sure that we keep and we are keeping our NPS scores and our retention high. So that\u2019s the magic formula there. I think keeping our expenses lower and improving margin if it results in lower client satisfaction, lower retention is not going to help us in the long term, but fortunately and again credit to the associates and to the management team, we\u2019re actually pulling it off where we\u2019re getting both of those things right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kevin McVeigh</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Super. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tien-tsin Huang</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning and congrats to Christian and Danny. I want to ask on \u2013 I guess a big picture question maybe for the team just balancing \u2013 you\u2019re balancing the new tech investments, you just mentioned the transformation initiatives in the pipeline there, but just given that you\u2019re early \u2013 you\u2019re on track to get to your fiscal year targets this year \u2013 for fiscal '20, I\u2019m sorry. Are you more willing to invest and stay in the short to midterm to maybe energize revenue growth and get that up a little bit more, or is your preference to still hit the higher end of your long-term margin target? Just trying to understand how you might be balancing revenue growth and margin expansion given where you are now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a great question and I think our Board obviously has that discussion with us as well. And I think our Board is very long-term oriented. And so as much as we\u2019re committed to hitting all individual components, it\u2019s about balancing all of those factors to really create long-term sustainable growth. And we would love to have as much growth as possible. And when I think about where are some of those places that we could invest, as an example like in our sales organization, we are fully staffed. I think we\u2019re probably a little bit ahead of our plans in terms of our headcount. So we clearly have some execution issues there, especially as we mentioned in our international and multinational businesses and some difficult compares over the last year, but we have really strong performance in the downmarket and in the midmarket and even in the domestic upmarket this quarter. So it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under investing. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019re not under investing in sales and marketing. We also have a brand campaign that we\u2019ve invested in over the last year which has added some expense. So I think we\u2019ve put our money where our mouth is when it comes to sales and marketing. And then turning to the other obvious places where we could invest again for growth and product in our R&amp;D organization, again, R&amp;D grew but always say that we could spend more. But when I look at the year-over-year and even a three-year growth of our investments in our Next-Gen platforms and even some of the additional feature functionality that we\u2019re adding to our existing product, including user experience, that\u2019s again a place where our investments are growing. So you can see it from our depreciation and amortization line, when you see it in the Q and you can see it and hear it from our words that we are \u2013 you can see in our balance sheet in terms of capitalized software. So we believe that we are investing for the future and that we have \u2013 sometimes you have these timing issues because we do have a lot of enthusiasm, for example, about our Next-Gen platforms. But relative to the size of the company, this is the first year where we have \u2013 over the last 12 months is the first time we\u2019ve actually got clients now live on our Next-Gen platforms, including Next-Gen payroll and Next-Gen HCM which we call Lifion. So we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re ahead of plan. But you have less than 10 clients on one of the platforms and call it 30 to 40 clients on another one of those platforms, so it just doesn\u2019t make a difference yet in terms of the sales results or the revenue results, but it doesn\u2019t dampen our enthusiasm around the future. So again, I guess the long and short of it is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of investment, but trust us that if we see an opportunity to invest for growth, we will take it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tien-tsin Huang</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. And then just maybe on that point with the U.S. bookings, it sounds like it\u2019s more international again. So I\u2019m curious if this is more cyclical or is there some very broad base or is it more \u2013 just a few select clients just looking for a decision, just trying to better understand the visibility here on the international side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the most obvious one in terms of because it\u2019s easy to see and quantify is in our large Global View multinational deals, we had a very difficult compare. Now, of course, that means that 12 months ago we were celebrating getting those deals and those sales and also we talked about it that that was giving us tailwind at the time when I think we did, but we\u2019d have to go back to the transcripts. And now unfortunately now we have a very difficult compare. Now we just had our rethink meeting, we call it rethink meeting where we have all of our large multinational prospects and clients and I think we walked away with a very solid pipeline and a lot of enthusiasm. And so we feel good about hopefully the second half. And whether it\u2019s the second half or next year, but any less enthusiastic about our multinational solutions but we just have a very difficult compare. So that\u2019s an obvious place. We do have a couple of what we call in-country or best-of-breed locations that are also having some challenges that I think also have some difficult compares. But it\u2019s hard to point at any kind of cyclical or product issues, because we\u2019ve been strengthening our products overseas as well and I think investing in our sales force. So again \u2013 and European economy in particular seems to be at a minimum stabilizing if not improving. So I don\u2019t think we can point to anything cyclical which is why we remain optimistic about the turnaround.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll just add a little more color and talk about it in terms of kind of U.S. bookings overall. I guess what I\u2019d say is that, look, as you go into the year there\u2019s always going to be areas where you do better and areas where you do worse than you may have planned. And thus far into the year we\u2019ve seen particular strength in downmarket as we\u2019ve noted in our comments. And actually internationally we\u2019ve also seen strength in our Celergo streamline product which was quite nice to see. And as you saw, the multinational Global View is where we were seeing really the slowness or the weakness for the last two quarters now. It\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not really seeing that it\u2019s attributable to any change from an economic landscape or environment standpoint but more so just seeing delayed decision making and it\u2019s taking time to get these larger and sometimes much more complex deals through the decision making process. So we\u2019ve seen it two quarters in a row. The pipeline looks pretty decent. We\u2019ve got some of these deals in the pipeline, but remains to be seen exactly how much longer it takes to get them closed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tien-tsin Huang</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks. See you in a couple of weeks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ramsey El-Assal</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could I ask you to give us kind of a brief macro overview in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in your various markets given everything that\u2019s going on in the world today, any callouts or any changes in the environment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when we look at \u2013 we have a few things that we obviously look at in terms of, call it economic macro indicators. The ones that are kind of relatively stable I would call them relatively stable or pace for control and wage growth and we look at obviously our own data as we get ready for this earnings call but we also have the ADP research institute that publishes its own kind of wage growth information and other factors around the economy. And I think all those signs positive point to what I would call stability. Our pace for control was slightly lower than it was the previous quarter in that trend, but we\u2019ve seen that many times before where we go 2.5% one quarter and then we go a little bit lower the next quarter, but then it comes back to 2.5%. It does seem and we\u2019ve been saying it and we\u2019ve been wrong so far that as the labor markets tighten, there\u2019s just not enough people available in the U.S. to continue to drive the kind of pace for control work that we\u2019ve experienced. But obviously labor force participation has been ticking up slightly and for a variety of reasons that\u2019s continued to hum along. And again, we see the same kind of indicators that all of you see around consumer spending, et cetera. So when we look across all of our domestic businesses, the pace for control growth seems to be a reasonable indictor that the economy is on stable ground. And wage growth we think should continue to accelerate, but that\u2019s moderated slightly also for the last couple of quarters but it\u2019s still at robust levels and should drive continued consumer spending and continued consumer confidence. We do look at pace for control also outside of the U.S. and I think there we again in our numbers see some signs of stabilization in Europe when it comes through on the unemployment and pace for control metrics there. So for us I think that everything looks \u2013 bankruptcies are \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the same things at our own business that you see through external metrics. We don\u2019t see any kind of elevation or increase in out of business or bankruptcies in our downmarket business, which is the canary in the coal mines, the first place you would see it. And our sales are also strong in the downmarket and the midmarket, so it doesn\u2019t feel like the weakness we had this quarter is anything other than the lumpiness that we talked about around multinationals, because new business bookings would be another I think macro indicator that could weaken. We talked about our retention continuing to improve. Retention doesn\u2019t improve in a bad economy, because it \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things that really suffers as a result of out of business in a downmarket and that has stayed strong and solid. So no negatives that we can see in the macro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ramsey El-Assal</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And you\u2019ve sort of addressed this. Dovetailing with Kathleen's last answer and your answer just now, but can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and that doesn\u2019t manifesting itself as sort of pricing-related actions or an intensification of maybe more an increasing opposing bidders showing up for contract processes or new business models emerging out there. I\u2019m just trying to explore whether there\u2019s any other peripheral causes for some of I think what are timing-related delays in things like bookings especially maybe in Europe but elsewhere as well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So back to maybe a little bit of what Kathleen said about, there\u2019s always \u2013 there\u2019s positive and there\u2019s negative. When it comes to competitors, it\u2019s the same thing. We have a lot of competitors in each of our segments and some years we do better, some years we do worse, but we do have the overall balance of trade and our situation there is better. And you would think that based on our retention results and based on the comments we just gave you about new business bookings in our downmarket, midmarket and domestic upmarket business. So I think in North America I think if you look at those results, I would say our competitive situation has improved and it shows in our net balance of trade that we keep track of. Particular I would point out besides the continued strength in our downmarket business which has been growing market share here for a few years, if you look at our midmarket business, the last two quarters in particular were quite strong in terms of what we call new logos against a variety of competitors. But again, we can\u2019t point to any one competitor because we have a large set of competitors. Some of them are geographically concentrated and some of them are national, but I think we\u2019re very pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance against those competitors in the midmarket. And then in the upmarket I would say that the addition of Workforce Now and call it the 1,000 to 5,000 range, so the lower end of our upmarket which we did a couple of years ago has really been an important generator of win-loss and balance of trade success for us in the upmarket. So we\u2019ve had a robust growth in units and revenue and sales dollars from introduction of Workforce Now into that 1,000 to 5,000 which addresses a segment of the market where that platform really has a lot of appeal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ramsey El-Assal</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That is super helpful. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, guys. I just want to drill in a little bit more on the commentary around the delayed decision making. Have you guys been down selected for these contracts already or is the actual RFP process still kind of dragging along?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wish I could tell you that I have that level of detail. I don\u2019t. So this is really \u2013 it ties back to the comment I made before about we have a certain number of sales people in the field, we have a certain pipeline of dollars that we track year-over-year and we know what our sales results were the previous year in the same period whether it was the first quarter or the first two quarters of the year. So we are attributing the weakness to the late decision making. But this is not \u2013 we do have large contracts particularly in multinational and they definitely move the number from one quarter to the other, but we don\u2019t have $50 million, $100 million contracts. It\u2019s not that kind of business. So I don\u2019t put \u2013 I know our sales leaders have that level of detail. I don\u2019t have it available at my fingertips here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, maybe you\u2019re asking kind of have we seen any particular shift in where things are in terms of stages of the cycle and stages in the pipeline. Nothing that we\u2019ve seen or heard that we can draw any conclusion from or point to any trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we do have pipeline of deals \u2013 sure, we went into rethink this year with more participants, more attendees and a larger pipeline of dollar opportunity than we had the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. I was just curious if you were just kind of waiting for some final signatures to make the bookings official or if it really is a matter of kind of just broader pipeline conversion. Just my second quick follow up just on the margins. You had the 70 bps up overall in the quarter, which was better than you expected, but at the segment level I know ES was up only 30 and PEO was down 30 if I\u2019m not mistaken. So I think it was some of the below the line drivers that got you to the 70. Can you elaborate on those because I know you have some add backs in your adjusted EBIT margin calculation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I can help maybe a little bit with that. As you know, the transformation initiatives that we are undergoing right now, some of those are sort of back office facing as well. So if you think about procurement and the workforce optimization initiative, those will have impacts to items that what we would deem other in the segment review. So corporate functions, for example, that\u2019s where the delta probably sits for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jason Kupferberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. Thank you, guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Marcon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Let me add my congratulations to both Christian and Danny. With regards to the bookings, just looking ahead and thinking about the comparisons for the third and fourth quarters, are there things that we should think from a sequencing perspective in terms of they\u2019re both \u2013 one\u2019s up 10%, one\u2019s up 11%. Is there anything that\u2019s particular in one versus the other that would make it a more difficult comp or how should we think about the bookings over the next two quarters in terms of the sequencing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think our number one goal is to obviously maintain the momentum we have in everything other than our international and multinational businesses. And again, these businesses not just because of the big ocean between them, they are fairly separate, right, in terms of how they\u2019re managed in terms of sales and sales execution and so forth even though we have one worldwide sales organization. So we feel good that we\u2019re going to be able to maintain the momentum we have in the rest of the business and then hopefully we get a little bit of tailwind with some of this stuff going our way in terms of the larger deals and some of the international stuff that we talked about. We do have in the second half, particularly in the last quarter, we do have a difficult compare because last year as you recall we purchased \u2013 it was a client-based acquisition \u2013 an acquisition of the company with a client-based acquisition of Wells Fargo\u2019s payroll business and that helped our new business bookings and obviously translated into some revenue helping in a downmarket and it was part of what\u2019s given us some tailwind from a revenue growth standpoint in that business. But since it was a client-based acquisition, it does \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t an acquisition of a business, it does roll through our new business bookings and that was I believe in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Marcon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s [indiscernible] and that\u2019s part of the reason for asking the question. So arguably the third quarter should be a little bit of an easier comp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For some reason they never feel easy, but mathematically \u2013 you\u2019re probably mathematically correct. But we have a lot of things that we\u2019re cooking to make sure that we hit \u2013 obviously our intention is to achieve the guidance we provided and we don\u2019t provide it lightly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Marcon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And then, Carlos, obviously you\u2019ve got a longstanding set of experiences with the PEO market. How are you feeling about the longer-term trajectory of the market? What are you thinking or ex pass-throughs, the sustainable growth rate is there? And what are you seeing on the competitive front? It seems like there\u2019s a little bit more private capital that\u2019s coming into the space. So just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that space and the legislative outlook there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, when you look at again the balance of trade information there, I feel pretty good about our competitive situation. So you always feel good about your own children, about your business, but you got to look at the facts, right. And I think the facts are pretty good for us in terms of our win-loss in our balance of trade. So that feels pretty good. And then the second thing that makes me feel really good particularly in this quarter versus last year and started to feel it last quarter is we really took a while to kind of filter through to make sure that we had our incentives properly aligned to make sure that our sales force is focused on obviously, number one, selling the right thing to our clients but making sure that they\u2019re properly incented to make sure that the PEO is something that they raise, because it\u2019s a difficult sale, because it\u2019s a high involvement sale and so you have to have the right incentives in order for the sales force to really want to sell it. And so I think we did that and I think we talked about that. It\u2019s got to be 12 months ago I think it was. So that feels like it\u2019s starting to filter through and I think we talked about very strong double-digit new business bookings for the quarter which that\u2019s the most important metric for the future to really give us confidence that the business model is still strong and intact. So that feels pretty good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Marcon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Terrific. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Samad Samana</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to maybe ask a question about what\u2019s been going on in terms of bookings and how you\u2019re thinking about guidance. Was guidance updated just to reflect what bookings has done so far this year or have you may be made some changes to the guidance framework to account for some more of the variability or variance that you\u2019re seeing in multinational or international deals closing? So I guess is guidance more conservative or are you using the same framework that you\u2019ve historically used? And then maybe just one follow up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Again, just a reminder just given the last comment that I made about the PEO that the guidance that we provide for bookings is ES only just to be clear. So if you look at our combination of our PEO and ES sales, it\u2019s a better picture and a stronger picture in the first half than what our guidance would depict, because we provide guidance for the PEO based on average worksite employee growth, not on new business bookings. But having said that, I think the answer is just \u2013 this year like there\u2019s no change in our thinking or our framework given that we just think there\u2019s some large deal delays that I don\u2019t think impact our deal in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, no change in framework, no change in kind of the way we\u2019re rolling up that forecast or the data we\u2019re looking at. For example, we look at things like, okay, where\u2019s business coming from in terms of by segment or by geography or new clients versus upsell to existing clients. We\u2019re continuing to see fairly consistent trends in terms of the split between new and upsell. So no change in the framework. It\u2019s more so just, look, we\u2019ve seen slower out of the gates for two quarters now, lower than we expected in international. And so we thought it was \u2013 given that we\u2019re six months into the year here, we thought it made sense to give you our best view. So, therefore, we narrowed the view for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Just one other comment in terms of something little bit quirky about as we changed our guidance to focus on ES worldwide bookings versus the PEO based on average worksite employees. The reason we gave you some color about the bookings for the PEO this quarter is even though we\u2019re not going to change the way we do our guidance is in some respects what\u2019s good for the PEO sometimes in the short term if business gets referred to the PEO, it can have in the short term a dampening effect on Employer Services. But we still had a great result in the downmarket and in the midmarket in Employer Services. So we definitely can\u2019t point to that. But again, it is kind of important to keep in mind that it\u2019s really the combination of those two that are driving overall ADP bookings and overall ADP revenue growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Samad Samana</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if I could just ask one follow up. I think there\u2019s a lot of excitement around Lifion coming off of HR tech and ahead of the Innovation Day that the company is hosting. So I just wanted to see if there\u2019s any early patterns in terms of customer profile, whether it\u2019s by size or whether \u2013 what do you think about existing products that they\u2019re using, whether it\u2019s Vantage or Workforce Now, maybe where are you seeing the early adopters come from and any type of profile commentary you could give on that would be helpful? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, in our case everybody\u2019s maybe approaches it differently, but we started off with smaller, less complex clients and now we\u2019ve actually just sold I\u2019ll call \u2013 consider it to be very large clients, so call it tens of thousands of employees. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of very large sales that we\u2019ve done and we have a bunch in the middle and then we have a few smaller ones that we did in the early days. Some of the business we\u2019ve sold is obviously new logo, some of it has been as you mentioned off of some of our existing platforms. I don\u2019t think that I can point to one particular platform and say that we\u2019re not targeting \u2013 because we\u2019re not trying to do migration or upgrades. We\u2019re trying to go after clients that have the right profile and the right needs, right, so that we can make them happier ADP clients in the long term. So we know what the capabilities are of the platform and we try to target the clients and the prospects whether they\u2019re internal or external in the appropriate manner. So I guess the best way to put it is it\u2019s kind of across the board in terms of \u2013 from an internal view. And then in terms of industry or size of client, fortunately it\u2019s also kind of a wide spread.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Samad Samana</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Togut</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good morning. There have been a few questions on bookings already, but this seems to be the main question of the day. The one question that I\u2019d like to explore here is you\u2019re still in the critical selling season which typically runs December to February. So is there anything you see in your pipeline in the U.S. or confidence on international close rates that gives you the confidence that you can close this critical selling season in better shape that we\u2019ve seen obviously in the second quarter and the first quarter bookings results?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, at the risk of getting too much into the sausage making, if you remember like part of our business particularly downmarket and into some of our midmarket, we report our sales when they start. So they\u2019re \u2013 like bookings and starts are basically equivalent. But when you get to very large deals, that\u2019s where you\u2019re really recognizing a sale and then the revenue starts at a later date. It could be six months, it could be 12 months. With a very large complex international deal, it could be 18 months later. So to your point about the critical selling season, pretty much now and done because January is the biggest month for us particularly for our downmarket business and the lower end of our midmarket business as well and the PEO. So just because of a natural cycle of the PEO, a large number of clients \u2013 by the way affect retention as well, but from a new business bookings standpoint January is the critical month for us. So the December-January period is the critical month for us in the PEO. And again, we\u2019re in the middle of that quarter so it\u2019s kind of hard to make comments about the quarter since the quarter isn\u2019t done yet. But I think in a downmarket and in our PEO in particular, we had I\u2019d say a good start to the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. The only other thing I would add and this is with regard to the ES bookings in particular, if you kind of look at the cadence of the year last year and this year and you look at six months year-to-date, we\u2019re at about the same point this year as we were last year in comparison to where we ended the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Togut</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in other words, you see enough in the pipeline at this point and expect to close rates that drive your expectation of the 6% to 7% bookings target. Is that accurate?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that \u2013 again, that is a level of detail to say that we have specific things in the pipeline. I think just to reiterate what we said before, so the number one driver of our confidence in our sales results in most of our business is headcount and execution and we believe we\u2019re fully staffed and we have that headcount in place. In the place where we\u2019ve had the variability or the volatility, if you will, it does come down to what you\u2019re describing which is RFPs, pipeline, et cetera. Yes, we do believe we have the pipeline and the visibility of that pipeline to feel that we will close the gap for the rest of the year. But that\u2019s not \u2013 in our SBS business, in our downmarket business, it doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s really more about the volume \u2013 it\u2019s a volume business. It\u2019s really related to having the proper amount of headcount, the right digital marketing tools and spend and again there we feel good and we feel confident.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Togut</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks so much. I\u2019m apologizing for asking another bookings related question. I just wanted to clarify something. I\u2019m assuming that most of your clients are in calendar year-end as opposed to your June year-end. When you talk about the late decision making, does this mean that decisions are being deferred until another year from now or is it something that could happen within the next quarter or so?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the good news for ADP is we have clients with all kinds of year-ends because we have a lot of clients. So really it spans the gamut. But you\u2019re right that probably the average company in the U.S. has a calendar year-end. But I think most large companies and particularly multinationals which I would consider ADP to one of those, we typically when we are negotiating with a vendor for a large contract, we\u2019d be focused more on their fiscal year-end rather than our own fiscal year-end. And so you\u2019re right that there are some drivers around people\u2019s budgets and so forth, but a lot of procurement departments tend to focus on the vendors year-end. And so we\u2019ve seen historically \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen again this year \u2013 is that our fourth quarter for large domestic and especially for large multinational deals is a particularly important quarter because prospects are recognized that even though we\u2019re not like a typical software company that negotiating towards a company\u2019s fiscal year end at least in their minds tends to be a good time to sign deals or negotiate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. I appreciate that --</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christian Greyenbuhl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry, Jeff, just one reminder. I know we said it before, but the 1% impact on an annual basis in business bookings equating to that 17 million, these multinational particularly Global View deals, you can imagine that if you take that on a quarterly basis, it does have \u2013 just to put it in perspective that outsized impact. So from a framing perspective, it is a pretty meaningful adjustment if you have some of these deals that flow in from one quarter to the next given that sensitivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the new business bookings results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christian Greyenbuhl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the new business bookings results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. Because on revenue \u2013 as you just described, the irony of the situation is that it doesn\u2019t have a big impact on revenue. We\u2019re having issues with FX and with client funds interest in particular are hurting us. It\u2019s not to deny that the bookings eventually will have some impact. The types of bookings that we have fallen short on in the first half are not particularly revenue impactful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I do appreciate the color on that. And then I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but you called out I guess the comp on the \u201cacquisition\u201d of the Wells Fargo payroll business last year. Anything else to call out between 3Q and 4Q that might affect the cadence of those quarters? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of new business bookings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, the overall business either revenues or margins?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, again, back to revenues and margins, the client funds interest issue and again going back to kind of the three-year guidance that we gave a few years ago, again, obviously not expecting a lot of sympathy from this crowd, but we\u2019re probably about $100 million less than where we expected to be in terms of client funds interest and we\u2019re obviously able to overcoming some of that as we go forward. So that in the second half is actually going to according to what I\u2019m seeing in terms of our forecast. That\u2019s going to start to have an impact on revenue growth as well, not a huge impact but where we were getting call it 1% lift in terms of revenue growth last year in the second quarter, I think this second quarter it was a much smaller number and in the second half it goes to probably no help to actually hurting our revenue growth. So that\u2019s a headwind for us. But when I really take out all these issues; FX, client funds interest and other kind of calendar noise issues, when you look at the net impact of new business bookings starts, not new business bookings sales but new business bookings starts minus losses. So if you take retention and new business that have started, if you compare last year\u2019s second quarter to this year\u2019s second quarter and hopefully the same thing continues into the second half, we have a slight acceleration. It\u2019s not a huge acceleration, but a slight acceleration. So that\u2019s what makes me feel good about the strength in the underlying business because there\u2019s a lot of noise happening in between with calendar and remember last year, we also had a one-time item that we mentioned that we called SUI pull forward in the PEO and accounting change that we were obligated to make that helped the second quarter revenue growth. And so all those things you have to kind of separate all those and get down to the core of the business and how the core business is performing. And on that basis, I feel good about the quarter and I feel good about the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the only other thing I would add to your question about kind of quarterly linearity in the balance of the year. Just as a reminder, in the second half of last year we had much, much more margin expansion in Q3 than in Q4. So, therefore, tougher comps for us this year Q3 versus Q4 in terms of margin expansion. So while we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, I would expect not a whole lot in Q3 and then potentially much more in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But again, back to like \u2013 in terms of what I mentioned in terms of some of these comparisons that were difficult versus last year\u2019s second quarter, some of those things then get easier on a revenue standpoint, notwithstanding the issues from client funds interest as we pull forward actually helped last year\u2019s second quarter, but depressed our third quarter. So that\u2019s going to make an easier comparison. So we do expect slight improvement in our revenue growth in the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christian Greyenbuhl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just a brief reminder of the fourth quarter, so as a reminder, so we did the client-based acquisition. So that added some amortization expense, which will lap in the fourth quarter and obviously it would increase booking expense related to the client-based acquisition as well. So just keep that in mind. And then we obviously launched our brand campaign I think in the third quarter, but most of that was really the expense was kicking off in the fourth quarter as well. So that will be lapped as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I guess what you\u2019re saying is you got some tailwinds in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Christian Greyenbuhl</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeffrey Silber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you for clarifying that. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lisa Ellis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats to Christian and Danny from me as well. Carlos, you mentioned a couple of times and I think in the presentation the progress on both Lifion as well as the Next-Gen payroll and tax. Can you give an update on where you are on the deployments of the Next-Gen payroll and tax engines and how they\u2019re impacting your business perhaps on the retention side or some of the other impacts? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Thanks. Very excited about the Next-Gen payroll as well as the back office tax, but the payroll engine even though it\u2019s somewhat back office I think has some positive qualities in terms of potentially helping us both in terms of \u2013 in the future both around bookings but also around efficiency and cost. I think we have somewhere between 30 and 40 live clients in our Next Generation payroll platform suite. As you can imagine, in comparison to the size of ADP, it\u2019s a relatively small impact in terms of revenue retention or any of the other actual metrics. But enormous amount of enthusiasm around what we\u2019re doing there, both at the team level. I think the team is incredibly enthusiastic and I think the rest of the organization is very enthusiastic as well in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the early days, especially around the flexibility of how quickly we can, for example, make changes and that\u2019s just related really to the investments in the platform itself. So we\u2019ve already kind of experimented and I think we maybe talked about this in the past with kind of federation as you call it in trying to have others develop and build on that platform. We\u2019ve done the same thing on Lifion. And so now we have a team, for example, in Australia that is actually built Australian payroll and we have one or two clients on that as well. And so we\u2019re incredibly happy with what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re really happy that we have live clients and this is the first year that \u2013 again, even though it was, call it 30 to 40 clients, this was the first time we\u2019ve gone through year-end. So we actually had to go through a year end and do all the year-end closing activities, W2s, et cetera. So it\u2019s still very early days just because of the size of ADP, but if we were a start-up, this would be like really great news. Like this was the \u2013 if this was a discussion about a start-up like we\u2019ve got now a lot of technical risk behind us, if you will, and now we have scaling and execution risk that\u2019s still in front of us. But that\u2019s a hell of a lot better than where we would have been two to three years ago, and I think it could really add to our competitiveness here in the long run, not to mention to help a lot in terms of our back office costs. On the tax side, that\u2019s probably more focused on back office cost and efficiency, but that also has an impact on our associates in terms of their ability to deliver service and also the experience that our clients have when we do things like amendments and tax notices. And so, again, the news there is very positive. We have \u2013 I think it\u2019s close to 140,000 to 150,000?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Kathleen Winters</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, about 140,000 clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">About 140,000 clients. Obviously, those are smaller downmarket clients in a limited number of jurisdictions. But I think we\u2019ve now \u2013 we\u2019re up to 20 \u2013 more than 20 jurisdictions. Jurisdictions by the way refers to number of states in addition to federal, places where we can actually do the taxes. And so I\u2019d say that that\u2019s progressing also very, very well. Again, a highly flexible platform that we\u2019re very optimistic in terms of what it can do to us down the road and see no scaling issues so far in either of those platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Lisa Ellis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent. Thank you. That seems like a good point to end on. I\u2019ll see you guys in a couple of weeks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Carlos Rodriguez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carlos Rodriguez</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. So as you can tell, we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the progress we continue to make on both the financials but also on our strategy. Obviously as we keep saying over and over again, we\u2019re trying to build on our success in the past but also transform for the future here so we can continue to deliver sustainable growth for many years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I also want to mention that this time of year as somebody mentioned about this being a busy time of the year for us from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s also a very busy time for our associates who deliver service and also our year-end commitments to our clients. It\u2019s very long hours and very hard work and I really appreciate the commitment of our associates. And again, it\u2019s one of the great differentiators we have in terms of being able to deliver that level of service, especially at a very busy time of the year like we are right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be able to be successful in the long run without strong products. And so when we have our Investor Day, we\u2019re going to hopefully lay out a plan for you about how the sustainability of the strength of ADP will be I think helped by the investments we\u2019ve been making over the last five years in our next generation products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we look forward to spending time with you on February 10 to discuss all of these innovations that we\u2019ve been investing in, in addition to the Next-Gen platform and also discussing a little bit of our vision for the future about how we expect work to change and the HCM industry to change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I want to thank you once again for your interest in ADP and for joining us today. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.</p>", "twitContent": "$ADP - Automatic Data Processing, Inc.
