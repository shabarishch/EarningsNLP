Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Safra Catz</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and fiscal year 2016. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q1 and provide some color on FY 2017, and then I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments. Clearly, we\u2019re thrilled with our results with the most obvious thing being that we dramatically over achieved again in the cloud. For most companies as their business grows, the growth rates go down. In our case, as the business grows, the growth rates are continuing to increase. In our SaaS/PaaS business, we reported 20% growth in fiscal year 2014, 34% in fiscal year 2015, and now 52% in fiscal year 2016, and not to get ahead of myself, but we expect to see even higher SaaS/PaaS growth this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll continue to use constant dollar growth rates on our quarterly call, so we can have some measure of consistency across quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business. This past quarter, the effects of currency movements were slightly less than expected with a 1% to 2% headwind in most revenue categories, including 1% to total revenue and a $0.01 headwind to earnings per share. Cloud, SaaS, and PaaS revenue for the quarter was $691 million, up 67% from last year and well above the 61% high-end of my guidance, and up 17% sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, as regard to our cloud revenue accounting, we have reviewed it carefully and are completely confident that it is a 100% accurate and if anything slightly conservative. You can also see the continuing revenue acceleration of our cloud business in the SaaS and PaaS billings and deferred revenue. The gross deferred revenue balance is now nearly $1.4 billion, up 64% in U.S. dollars. SaaS and PaaS billings grew 38% in U.S. dollars this quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve put the billings numbers up on our website for you to see the detail. And though there will be seasonality to some of these numbers, we\u2019re now growing faster than both Salesforce and Workday in every way; revenue growth, deferred revenue growth, and billings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As our Saas PaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin continues to expand. The Q4 gross margin for SaaS and PaaS was 57%, up from 40% last Q4 and we expect to see further improvements in fiscal year 2017, and from there, we\u2019ll be targeting 80% over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Combined with cloud infrastructures as a service revenue of $169 million, which was up 8%. Our total cloud revenue in the quarter was $860 million, up 50% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $7.6 billion with software updates and product support revenues at $4.8 billion, up 4% from last year. Attach and renewal rates remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">New software license revenues were $2.8 billion, down 10%, reflecting the accelerated migration to cloud. Total hardware, including hardware support was down 7%, with hardware systems product revenue of $725 million and hardware support revenue of $558 million. For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $10.6 billion, up slightly in constant currency from last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 billion and the operating margin was 45%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was at 24.4% and EPS was $0.81 in U.S. dollars. The GAAP tax rate was 24.6% and GAAP EPS was $0.66 in USD. Had currencies not moved by the way, non-GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.01 higher and GAAP EPS numbers would have been $0.02 higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now covering the full fiscal year, total software and cloud revenues totaled $29 billion, growing 3% in constant currency. Cloud, SaaS and PaaS were $2.2 billion, growing 62%. Cloud infrastructure as a service was $646 million, growing 11%. On-Premise Software grew slightly in constant currency to $26.1 billion, as continued growth in software support offset could-related declines in new software license.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So our SaaS and PaaS business has now grown to the point that we expect the dollar growth in SaaS/PaaS revenue will exceed the dollar declines in new software license in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. But more importantly, when you look at our software business, we have an On-Premise business basically growing a bit or flattish and the cloud business layering on top of that growing very fast and growing as a percentage of the software business, and then you can understand why we start growing significantly this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the year, total revenues grew 2% to $37.1 billion, and operating income was 15.8 billion and assuming no more wild currency swings this fiscal year, I expect that we will see operating income growth this next year. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the full-year was 43% and non-GAAP EPS was $2.61. Had currencies not moved, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.17 higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $13.6 billion, with capital expenditures for the quarter at $180 million. Free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.4 billion. We now have approximately $66 billion in cash and marketable securities, net of debt our cash position is approximately $12.3 billion, a short-term deferred revenue balance is $7.7 billion, up 7% in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we said before, we\u2019re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt and a dividend. In terms of acquisitions, we continue to focus on finding the right companies at the right s that make both strategic and financial sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter, we repurchased 49 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months, we repurchased 272 million shares for a total of $10.4 billion. We paid out dividends of $2.5 billion for a total that is 105% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, before I turn to guidance, I would like to provide a brief update on the operational transformation that I highlighted last quarter as we are working to position Oracle as our customers\u2019 strategic partner for the cloud. The first phase called the accelerated buying experience was rolled out in March. It was designed to make purchasing cloud services from us fast and simple and was built using our own configured price quote products, sales and service cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe that we are the first enterprise technology vendor to use click to accept functionality for enterprise customers and that enables our customers to complete their orders with a click of the button. The results for Q4 were fantastic as nearly two-thirds of our cloud deals were processed using the accelerated buying experience, and we saw the quote to book times reduced dramatically. These results are truly amazing, given the introduced the program in Q4 and salespeople had very little time to get use to it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our customers could then start using our services faster. We feel very good about the progress of our cloud transition and clearly customers are embracing the move with us. We now have the most complete set of cloud services in the industry with thousands of our customers around the world are using these cloud services to help run their businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re far enough along that our financial statements will begin to show our success with accelerating revenue growth, operating margin expansion over time leading to very solid EPS growth. Our guidance will reflect this making it easier to see that we are a force to be reckoned within the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, to my guidance. I\u2019m going to give you my guidance for Q1 and then some preliminary comments for fiscal year 2017. All of my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. Now currency \u2013 the current exchange rates remain the same as they are now. We expect to see a currency headwind of about 1% on some parts of cloud revenues, but very little effect on total revenue and EPS. And while we feel fantastic about our own performance and transformations, I\u2019m definitely keeping an eye on the macro environment, especially abroad and going to be a big conservative in my outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Even with that said for Q1, I\u2019m raising my earlier guidance for SaaS and PaaS revenue, which we now expect to grow 75% to 80%. And this guidance reflects a bit of additional revenue from acquisitions and higher guidance for the organic business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Software and cloud revenues, including SaaS/PaaS and IaaS, new software license and software and support is expected to grow 5% to 7%. Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 5%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.56 and $0.60, up from $0.53 last quarter \u2013 last Q1, depending on the mix of revenues and of course the tax rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the full-year for FY 2017, I expect SaaS and PaaS revenue growth will be higher than the 65%, up from 62% in FY 2016. SaaS and PaaS gross margins should exit Q4 FY 2017 much higher than the 57% reported today, as we show steady and continued improvement through the year. And I mentioned earlier \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, but operating income is also expected to grow in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I will turn it over to Larry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Lawrence Ellison</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, Safra. In the fiscal year just started FY 2017, Oracle has two specifics points of focus. First, we would like to accelerate our SaaS and PaaS growth and make sure we\u2019re at least double, growing at least double the rate of our closest competitors. And we think we have a fighting chance to be the first SaaS company to make it to $10 billion in revenue. We\u2019re the second largest SaaS company in the world now and we think we can be the largest SaaS company, including our \u2013 by the time we hit $10 billion, we\u2019re going to be the first one there. Why do I think that\u2019s possible?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One is, we\u2019re already growing at a very high rate much faster than our competitors, we\u2019ve proven, we can do this. Can we keep it up as our business continues to scale. Safra pointed out something that\u2019s shocking, that as we scale our business, our growth rates are going up. Why is that? The explanation is our SaaS portfolio. We compete in virtually every important SaaS area there is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re a major player in ERP and HCM. We\u2019re almost the only player in supply chain and manufacturing. We\u2019re the number one player in marketing. We\u2019re very competitive. We\u2019re number one \u2013 tied for number one in service. And we compete against Salesforce.com and sales automation. But in all of these areas, we compete on Salesforce.com, which is the largest SaaS company is really focused on sales automation and some of the other customer experience aspects. They just bought Demandware. They are making acquisitions. They are growing their business, but they are in the customer experience sales area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They don\u2019t compete in the largest category, which is ERP, also not HCM, again supply chain and manufacturing again and we think that gives us a huge advantage that our footprint is wider. And some of these mid-market companies can simply get in all Oracle footprint run their entire enterprise in the cloud on Oracle. That is something that Salesforce can\u2019t offer and we think that\u2019s going to service very well and allow us to keep these very high growth rate, while we go for that to be first at $10 billion, okay that\u2019s one thing. So we want to be one in number one. We think we need to be number one, we think we will be number one in SaaS and PaaS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second major point of focus is that, our generation two of our infrastructure as a service data center have been built and stocked with computers, and now we\u2019re beginning to bring our customers into these new data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Infrastructure as a service is the third leg of Oracle\u2019s cloud strategy. Obviously SaaS, we talk about a lot, and PaaS, we talk a lot about, because those few businesses are growing very rapidly for Oracle. So what\u2019s going on in infrastructure as a service? Well, we\u2019ve had to move to \u2013 we\u2019ve learned a lot about this business. There\u2019s a huge amount of demand by the way for our infrastructure as a service from our existing SaaS customers and our new SaaS customers and even bigger amount of demand, for infrastructure as a service from our database customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our database customers want to move their application into our cloud putting their database on to our platform as a service and then their applications, so a lot of custom applications on to our infrastructure as a service, these two things go together. And we built, again, the second generation data center, which we think is highly competitive with anything out there lower cost, better performance, better security, better reliability than any of our competitors, and there\u2019s huge demand for it, and we\u2019re now starting to bring customers into that. We think that\u2019s another very important driver to Oracle for overall growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re growing fast in SaaS. We\u2019re growing fast in PaaS. Now we need to grow fast in infrastructure as a service we\u2019ve made the investments. We have the right technology with our second generation data centers, and we\u2019re very excited about the potential for Oracle with the combination of PaaS and infrastructure as a service for our huge installed base of database customers and helping them move to the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Hurd</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, Larry. Just a few more numbers and we\u2019ll take your questions. Cloud bookings over $600 million in USD, 52% growth for us in CD. As a reminder, last year we grew more than 200%, so for this comparison is or this number is against that comparison.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In SaaS, roughly $350 million in USD bookings, in PaaS, over $250 million. Just one point of clarification, our ARR bookings are only for new and expansion. So I\u2019ve had some questions about do we include renewals in our bookings? We do not. Renewals are a separate bucket of bookings kept separate in our reporting. As it relates to renewals in the quarter, our renewals for the quarter were up 200 basis points year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">SaaS/PaaS revenue we grew 67%. We grew 17% quarter-on-quarter. ERP/EPM was 58% growth quarter-over-quarter. In HCM, we had our strongest growth rate in three years. That says our business has gotten bigger. In CX, all sales, marketing and service revenue growth rates were up double-digits. In data as a service, we nearly doubled year-over-year. Platform as a service had another break-out quarter. We nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter. Within doubling quarter-on-quarter, our database as a service business more than doubled quarter-on-quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our SaaS/PaaS billings grew 48% in FY 2016. Our SaaS/PaaS deferred revenue grew 64%. To Safra\u2019s point and I want to say it again grew much faster than Salesforce.com and Workday. Now, I want to come to another set of numbers that are actually probably more exciting, our customer metrics. In the quarter, we closed 1,640 new SaaS customers. Nearly, two-thirds were Fusion wins. We had 917 customer expansions that is an all-time high for us. 273 customers, who bought SaaS also bought PaaS. I want to make sure you understand that connect point. We think that connection will actually grow higher as time goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our SaaS installed base is now roughly 12,000 customers. In the quarter, we had \u2013 almost 700 CX customers in 600 expansions. In HCM, 318 new customers, 900 for the year, nearly 2.5 times that\u2019s what Workday reported. In ERP, we had 808 new customers in the quarter. I just want to make sure, I didn\u2019t misspeak, it\u2019s 808 new customers in the quarter. We doubled the FY 2016 count in Q4. Almost 50% of those customers never had an Oracle path. Our installed base is now over 2,500 customers, nearly 2.5 times the installed base from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have 1,577 customers now live on Fusion. We added nearly a 1,000 go-live this year. In PaaS, we added 2,005 new PaaS customers. Our installed base is now nearly 9,000 customers. In closing, this was a big year for us, not only in revenue, but bookings as well, where we sold more than $1.4 billion in ARR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to make just a couple predictions for the New Year. We had a big year in bookings in FY 2016. We will have a bigger year in FY 2017. Our pipeline is actually today up more than our bookings in our revenue reported growth rates. Revenue growth of 52% this year, our growth rate will be higher than 65% in FY 2017. And as Larry and Safra both mentioned, as our business gets bigger, we continue to grow faster.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So with that, we\u2019ll take whatever questions that you might have.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the Q&amp;A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on your cloud progress. I\u2019d like to drill in specifically into Platform as a Service, two parts to my question. The first is, can you give us some more color on your success in PaaS?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And second specifically, can you help us with understanding on how you\u2019re expanding the TAM for your database middleware et cetera, and what are the drivers? Is it newer segments, high revenue attach from existing customers? Any help would be appreciated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Mark, I\u2019ll start and then I think Larry is going to chip in. No question about that total available market expense because obviously when we win \u2013 just like in SaaS, if we win in SaaS, we actually get all of the middleware, all of the database, all of the hardware, we get really all of the services, so we get this multiple support that when we get an application, the whole stack comes with us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The same thing in effect occurs when we get database as a service as well, with it comes all of the other services that come with it as well. In addition, we get to expand our TAM to a whole new set of customers that otherwise we would never have gotten too. We get now to a whole set of mid-market customers that frankly we just didn\u2019t have an opportunity to sell-through before, because you had to have a datacenter, you had to have a computer, and you had to have a staff, and so now all of that TAM is expanded as well. So with a broader market set we get to and a whole set of market share that comes with it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other thing is the network effect between SaaS, PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service. So if you have, let\u2019s say, your ERP application and it\u2019s an Oracle ERP application then you want to build a bunch of data warehousing applications on top of the data from your ERP system, in a sense it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have the ERP system at Oracle and I\u2019ll put the data warehousing situation that Microsoft assure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But if you actually look at the pricing of cloud pricing that one part of cloud that\u2019s expensive is moving data out of data center, that\u2019s one thing they charge you a lot of money for it, and that\u2019s the kind of industry pricing the way it works. So moving data between data centers back and forth, back and forth between our data centers can be quite expensive. So there\u2019s an advantage for our built in products. If we have the ERP data and we have the ERP system, we have a built in advantage by offering our PaaS and our infrastructure as a service as a set of tools to allow you to build your data warehouses in your data marks using that ERP data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think that gives us a very significant advantage to us, the interaction between SaaS and PaaS and the interaction between PaaS and infrastructure as a service. I\u2019ll go back to infrastructure as a service. Well, why should they \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t it just move to Amazon. I mean, Amazon has been doing this for a while and they\u2019ve got infrastructure as a service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, because we handled the Oracle database much better than Amazon does, we can run very large Oracle databases. We run [at full power that way] [ph]. We just do a better job. I mean, this is not the place for me to give you a technical proof, but we do a better job than they do on the Oracle, they run Oracle databases, but we do a much better job. We run it faster, more reliable and more securely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, if I\u2019ve got the database in an Oracle \u2013 an Oracle data center in the Oracle cloud, it makes sense for me to put the application at a computer right next to that, that\u2019s higher performance, much lower cost, because I\u2019m not moving all those data in and out of an Amazon data center and in and out of an Oracle data center. Those things are going to be tend to be co-located.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we think we have some built in advantages being a strong player in SaaS and a strong player in PaaS and making it very \u2013 all of the customers who want to get their infrastructure as a service or their related infrastructure as a service from the same cloud supplier in the same data center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, I really appreciate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lawrence Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. Safra, you mentioned growth in operating income in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you can help us think about how that translates into growth in operating margins?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect operating margins to go up also as this continues. Obviously, cloud margins are going to the roof that\u2019s become obvious, and we expect operating margins to increase. So you\u2019ve got revenue increasing and operating margins also increasing over time and operating income increasing also over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re very \u2013 this is actually a very, very important time for Oracle financially, because what you see is that, we\u2019ve stopped having reductions in really in any of the numbers and we\u2019ve turned up in every way, including EPS. And I know for a while I was telling you, this is a transition and all that. But we feel like we\u2019re officially at the complete end of the beginning. Meaning, we\u2019re now in the mode of increasing improving EPS up, operating income up, revenue up everything we\u2019ve made the transition and we are moving up from here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d like to comment something in terms of margins. Our generation two of our data center, okay, what was wrong with generation 1, no one asked. Generation one was more expensive than we liked it. One of the great things about our Gen 2 data center is, we think we now have the best bang for the buck, the best class performance data centers in the world with our Gen 2 data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think we, again, we deliver more performance and cost of any cloud provider, we think that\u2019s another huge advantage for us. And we\u2019ll be scaling our business on this new very, very cost effective most modern of all the cloud networks that\u2019s going to help our margins enormously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Oracle team congratulations on the results as well. Mark, I guess, two sub-part questions for you try to keep it brief. One is, how would you explain the magnitude of outperformance on the SaaS and PaaS revenue growth relative to the midpoint of the guidance, wondering if the milestone criteria are turning out to be faster than you expected, or maybe that\u2019s not the case?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And secondly, as you look at your SaaS and PaaS revenues, there are a large number, and I\u2019m curious and also get questions from Investors as to what exactly is the relative size or magnitude of growth rates of the categories vis-\u00e0-vis HCM, ERP and CRM, digital marketing, any color you can give us there that would be fantastic? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. First, there\u2019s no one reason why we beat the revenue. It\u2019s a magnet, it\u2019s all of the reasons. I mean, first starts with, we booked more than we planned sort of point one and we not only booked more, we booked more faster than we thought. So it would improve our linearity as we \u2013 our team has done a great job in cloud from a provisioning perspective. Provisioning meaning, we then sell more \u2013 we sell more faster and then we actually get the customer up and running and live and that has another effect done on revenue linearity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, as I mentioned, our renewals were 200 basis points over prior year and not to say, it was better than we expected, but it was good, it was solid and that helped as well. Then we also had more usage on our platform. And so we\u2019ve had this continued sort of not linear, but geometric increase in the usage of our PaaS platform. So those that are not on subscription, but on here just use more. And so when you sort of add up all of those things and no one thing was 80% of its cash, it was really all of those things together added up to the beat that you referenced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your second question was the relative growth rates to various businesses. I\u2019ll start with there\u2019s sort of all good. It would be the way I would describe it, and the question becomes degree of good. I gave you a number specifically on ERP in terms of growth rate, and that number, I think, I gave it to your quarter-on-quarter in terms of growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do you know, what I\u2019ll do? As we get towards financial analyst day, I\u2019ll do more of a break-out pillar by pillar, but they\u2019re just all \u2013 I mean, our performance in marketing, our performance in HCM. In the HCM, I can\u2019t help myself here. On HCM, the performance of our team on HCM was just superb, and I mean that\u2019s a global statement Kash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, if we went back to the days of four or five year ago, it\u2019s just amazing, totally what our product team has done, our ability to release new product, our ability to get it to market, the references we\u2019ve gotten, I mean, we get almost 1,000 new HCM customers this year. 2.5 times the guide we were talking about three or four year ago. I mean it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s just \u2013 it was just a superb quarter for us by pillar. And I think to be honest with you, Kash, I think based on what I told you in my prepared remarks on the pipeline, I think it\u2019s going to get better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great to hear that. Congrats again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Kash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ken Bond</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question operator?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question again will come from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies &amp; Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I have a question about the database. You announced R2 of 12c back in Oracle open world, and I believe there was a webcast schedule that was postponed or you were supposed to do earlier this month on the database? I realize you can\u2019t talk about the timing of general availability of R2, but can you talk about, I don\u2019t know generally anecdotes about earlier adopters for R2? And then also your expectations of how this will be consumed by customers between license and cloud consumption, because that help with us regardless of how we think of it, how we\u2019re going to model it? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know, R2, a lot of people don\u2019t migrate to the DOT1 releases of our DOT1 \u2013 DOT1 releases of our database. They wait for the DOT2 release. So that it is completely stable. We have two key features in version 12 of our database. One is in memory, the other is multi-tenancy, both of those are in high demand. I think it\u2019s made in version 12 of our database, one of the most rapidly adopted versions in many, many years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The question is what will that adoption look like? I think, you\u2019ll see early adoption in the cloud. I think, cloud is going to lead the adoption. So we now have hybrid customer. Typical customer might have said, okay, I\u2019d like to experimenting with release 12 and I\u2019m going to put it on these product development computers over here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we\u2019re encouraging our customers to look an alternative. Why don\u2019t you just use the latest version in the cloud, and why don\u2019t you do your experimentation and your testing and your application migration to \u2013 and your upgrades in the cloud. It\u2019s going to save you some money, and allow you to get access even faster. And we think that what\u2019s going to happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also offering a version of our cloud hardware, our hardware configurations that it\u2019s while \u2013 because it\u2019s for statutory reasons on a bank and for statutory reasons, I really have a hard time moving this application into cloud, no problem. We\u2019ll take our existing cloud or cloud hardware, the exact same configuration, we will move it behind your firewall, and we\u2019ll let you \u2013 and we\u2019ll completely manage it for you behind your firewall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ll buy it just like it\u2019s cloud, in other words, you won\u2019t buy the hardware. There will no upfront cost for the hardware. There\u2019s no upfront cost for the software. It will look exactly like the Oracle Cloud. It\u2019s just the boxes will happen to be sitting on your data center floor behind your firewall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re getting people more options to go to the cloud, making it easier for them to go to the cloud, because when our customers go to cloud, which is what we want them to do, and we want them to go earlier and we \u2013 and other opportunity to get them to move to the cloud as \u2013 with accelerated adoption of 12 DOT2 of our database. That\u2019s how we would like them to consume it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If they go to the cloud, they save money and it\u2019s easier for them and we make more money and it\u2019s better for us. So that\u2019s will be pushing our people. So, again, we\u2019re incented and the customer is incented to get to the cloud as quickly as we can. How fast can we make that happen? We made it happen pretty fast in Q4, and we\u2019re going to keep pushing this fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Larry. That\u2019s helpful, but just one clarification. When you talk about cloud hardware configurations On-Premise, are you alluding to Exadata, is that what you\u2019re talking about, especially for the database?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lawrence Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually, it\u2019s very great. I\u2019m glad you asked the question, not just Exadata. So no, it would be our infrastructure as a service configuration and our Exadata configuration together, which is PaaS. So Exadata is really PaaS, it\u2019s just database as a service is what Exadata is, one we install it as part of the cloud that we manage it for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have a separate box, where you\u2019re running compute and block storage and all of our other cloud services. We basically, it\u2019s like we to open another \u2013 cloud datacenter. Imagine, we open another cloud data center at JPMorgan Chase. I\u2019m not picking on my poor friend Jamie Dimon, but that\u2019s my knowledge. We don\u2019t have a deal to do that at JPMorgan Chase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But anyway, but let\u2019s say they \u2013 I\u2019m comfortable, they got certain statutes and regulators wanted to do this behind their firewall. They\u2019re uncomfortable putting in the public cloud. We would actually create a little mini-version of our cloud datacenter on the JPMorgan Chase floor. We would manage it for. They would not buy the hardware. They would not buy the software. They would just buy a cloud subscription, just like it\u2019s in our cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s just so happens, we would locate that hardware, which we would manage. We would locate that hardware on their floor behind their firewall for more security. But it was just, again, it would be hard \u2013 it will manage as part of the Oracle public cloud. The hardware identical. The software is identical to the Oracle public cloud. We\u2019re just allowing our customers back option. We\u2019re trying to make it easier for them and give them more options to get to the Oracle public cloud, even if you\u2019re a highly regulated bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John DiFucci</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks, guys, and congrats on a great quarter, particularly on the cloud and the customer count number on the database with service side, it was quite impressive particularly. Question for Mark, there has been a lot of discussion out there, the rumors just in the market about your changes to the comp plan or the Salesforce focusing on cloud, not licensing and then others saying that you\u2019re dropping the cloud your compensation structure. So, wondering if you could just comment on if there are any changes to comp program to structure the Salesforce or kind of what they\u2019re focused on this fiscal year? That would be great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. There \u2013 really is no change to the \u201cstructure\u201d when you throw that in. So we are actually quite happy with our structure in that context. Now we\u2019ve actually cleaned up a few things. So I\u2019ve made some changes three or four years ago to, which group called on what and there were some things that we\u2019ve done that are \u2013 I would describe them as de minimis in terms of changes, but who calls on what size of account et cetera. So there\u2019s a little bit of that, but frankly not much else.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have made an investment, so as I know you know in what we call Oracle Direct. This is selling really a lot of inside sales with a little bit of outside sales that supplement it and we continue to raise the bar for those things. It is a lower cost of sales. It\u2019s a much modern \u2013 more modern way of selling and these are primary vehicle into what you would think of as SMB.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we continued to expand their use, expand the amount of headcount, invest in tools, we talked last \u2013 I think last quarter about investment we made in Austin, the CapEx we spent to build out that very modern center. So think of more of that Phil, more people, more support for that team and they\u2019re actually calling higher in terms of the size of accounts so they call, it very effective for us, more people. But when you look at our spending, our spending actually doesn\u2019t go up nearly as much as the amount of resource that we get as part of those investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the comp plan itself, there is no decrease in cloud comp. That\u2019s just pure nonsense of anything. We believe we pay to all salespeople that would like to make money. You sell cloud at Oracle, you will make more money than anywhere else in the industry and that\u2019s our model and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of On-Prem comp in just application, these are applications that are not our GBU applications. So think of them as our horizontal applications. We now do not retire quota for a license sale. We retire quota just on cloud. They do receive some \u201ccomp\u201d in the context as it relates to a license sale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But Phil, to understand today in horizontal as licenses, the vast majority of all of our licenses are in ERP. And the vast majority of those are add-on seats within ERP, into our existing base more users. And then within that, we put a special team in place that actually focuses on handling that within our user base. So I understand there\u2019s some noise about it, but I would describe this as a non-event.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks for your clarification.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By the way, I want to add \u2013 because I just can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t help myself. But as of today, we have all of our sales people who have a territory, they have a comp plan, they have a boss and virtually all of our salespeople, since the end of the year, I want to make sure I say this, since the end of our fiscal year have today been trained on all of our newest offerings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I have had this goal, Larry and I talked about this for years that we would get to the point that by the time we would start a year, instead of it taking forever. By the way, most companies take a quarter, four months, five months to get all this done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our objective has been that sales people leave the fiscal year on May 31 that as soon as possible, they get out of the year, they have a quota, they have a comp plan, they have a boss, they have a territory and they\u2019ve been trained on everything we\u2019ve got. And I can tell you as we sit here today, that is almost entirely complete for the entire Oracle Corporation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our next question will come from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks for taking my question. And I want to move up a little bit and talk about geographies on two aspects. First of all, Mark, can you talk a little bit about the success you have in cloud in the different regions. And then secondly more bigger picture is \u2013 obviously worries about end demand et cetera in the different regions and maybe you can comment on what you\u2019re seeing out there in the field in general for the whole business? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve missed one word. Did you say, end demand?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. By region, I think our performance in Asia Pacific was superb. Now that comes from where we\u2019ve been over the past couple of years, but I don\u2019t know that I would describe that as a market phenomena, I\u2019m just going to make my comments in the context of Oracle. I think our team in Asia, which we\u2019ve recruited over the past 18 months did a superb job all through the year. I think it culminated in a very strong quarter. We saw very strong growth really across every line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, license performance was quite strong. Both SaaS and PaaS growth rates were superb, so very positive on Asia. I feel the same way in Europe. I mean, there\u2019s mixed economy over in Europe. We don\u2019t actually talk about it much around here, because I think our performance in Europe has been consistent over the years. I think our performance was emblematic of that through the fiscal year and was good and solid in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I feel very good about it. I think that\u2019s the way I would describe things outside the U.S. LAD. We continue to deal with all the issues in Brazil. I would say within the context of overall LAD relative to the market, because our team performed fantastic. Our movement of the cloud in LAD is perhaps as fast as anything we have across our company. So \u2013 and then you get to the U.S. and I think in applications our move to the U.S. was the quickest, the fastest, and shows up in the majority of these wins that I talked about are in the U.S. I mean, there\u2019s some very exciting movements. Our business in applications in the U.S. is a cloud business, it is not a license business, it is a cloud business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">North America Tech has been strong in terms of its PaaS bookings \u2013 platform bookings. And I would say I\u2019d also like to throw in our GBUs. I have to mention the strength of their performance in cloud. The growth rate in our GBUs was superb, led by both our retail business, our hospitality business, and our health sciences GBU. They had a great win at Pfizer in the quarter and they have really kicked their competitor metadata pretty strong over the course of the year, and I\u2019d like to probably give them the credit for that, they\u2019ve done a great, great job. So maybe more data than you wanted, but that\u2019s my view going across the globe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Raimo Lenschow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Bradley Reback with Stifel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bradley Reback</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks very much. Safra, could you maybe give us some sense of what the CapEx requirements for the business should be here in 2017? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, overall CapEx should be a little bit more than it is this year very little bit more. And all of that would be actually from the real estate on our real estate side as we build out our campus in Texas. And also we have a little bit more real estate around the country on the cloud CapEx, which is the one I think you* guys have really been focusing on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you know, in FY 2015, it was quite high. It dropped really dramatically like 30% this past year, and it will go up a little bit, but not anywhere near where it was in FY 2016. So I think, generally, it\u2019s going to be around where it is right now. And any increases are entirely as a result of just some real estate thing that will benefit us for decade really as we purchase pieces of property stuff like that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To Safra\u2019s point, our cost per seat or a sales rep is declining. So our cost of housing them are countless that we have to make these CapEx investments, but salary, bonus everything as we move with such into this modern selling effort. We have more people, but our cost per seat is actually declining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bradley Reback</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great.

Mark, just given the new customer count in cloud and seen you\u2019re picking up some momentum in the mid-market, especially around ERP. Can you just discuss what\u2019s driving that? Is it just more focus in \u2013 from a sales standpoint? Is it having sort of our suite offering versus just our best-of-breed products? Just any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Kirk, I just think it\u2019s all of the stuff. I mean, I think listen, I mean, you can\u2019t start with the fact that we have good products, and we have good products that\u2019s a really big advantage. So that\u2019s sort of point one. Point two, we\u2019ve done a lot of training in our salespeople are frankly better and they come in* with good products. They now know a lot more about them and we have references, and when you have those sort of combinations, things go well for you. I think we\u2019ve done a good job, putting our people set this point about the investments we\u2019re making. We put our people in these new modern capabilities that are given them great tools now* go to market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let me say all this against the backdrop of \u2013 I think we\u2019re actually going to get better of this. So I think when you look at our \u2013 you can\u2019t look at them, I can. But when I look at our pipelines, I remember two years ago, I made the statements that I thought our ARR would be good a couple of year ago and lot of people said why?* And it is because our pipeline was up and I can see it mature to the pipeline. This pipeline we have now is the strongest best pipeline we\u2019ve had. And I believe our conversion rate meaning the movement of that pipeline into actually booked orders will actually get better for the very reasons we\u2019re* describing, so I\u2019m \u2013 quite optimistic about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kirk Materne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, mark.
