Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.</p> <p>On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and CEOs, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.</p> <p>As a reminder, today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today\u2019s discussion we will present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements made today.</p> <p>As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and we encourage you to review our most recent reports including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors. And other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.</p> <p>As a reminder and consistent with prior calls, Safra\u2019s and Mark\u2019s comments today will<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> use constant dollar growth rates unless stated otherwise so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarter as well, as to reflect how we actually measure the business.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revisit our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> in light of new information or future events. Before taking questions, we\u2019ll begin with a few prepared remarks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Safra.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Safra Catz</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q2. I\u2019ll then review guidance for Q3 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you can see, we had another excellent quarter. Customer adoption of our Cloud products and services continues to be very strong and what we have called our on-premise business remains robust. Bottom line, our transition to the Cloud is going well. Despite the currency benefit being less than my guidance, total revenue was more than the high end of my guidance range and earnings per share was at the high-end even at a higher tax rate than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year. Fusion Cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year. But just as a reminder, part of the Cloud PaaS and IaaS business is our legacy hosting services which don\u2019t share the same high growth characteristics as PaaS and next-gen IaaS services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This portion of PaaS/IaaS saw growth of 46% in CD and 49% in USD, while the traditional hosting services, which we are de-focusing, were down nearly 10%. As traditional hosting services become a smaller part of total PaaS and IaaS, the underlying growth of PaaS and next-gen IaaS will be more visible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I want to also take a moment to review the announcements we made in October of bring your own licenses, what we call BYOL and autonomous database. Unlike the applications business where customers move to SaaS subscriptions, stop buying upfront licenses and shelve application support, BYOL customers can leverage their years of investment in Oracle database and technology software and bring those licenses to the Oracle cloud infrastructure instead of cancelling their licenses and support and moving to rent new licenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With BYOL, we are seeing a strong increase in our technology installed base as customers renew their unlimited license agreement, invest in more licenses and options and renew support. Because BYOL is now available and customers better understand their transition options to move to the Oracle Cloud, technology new software license revenue is dramatically improving from the declines we were seeing previously. We expect this trend to continue as we roll out Autonomous Database as customers license the options and technology they need. We expect to continue to take share in database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars. In fact, we\u2019ve consistently overachieved our software and cloud revenue forecast the last seven quarters. I focus on these numbers, which we refer to as the ecosystem revenues, because that is where all of our software assets come together and you can start to see the powerful dynamics of the business, especially with our BYOL model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 39% from last year. Total on-premise software revenues were $6.3 billion, up 1% from last year, reflecting stable software license and continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">GAAP application total revenues which is new licenses and support and SaaS, were $2.7 billion, up 13% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenues, which includes new license and support and PaaS and IaaS, were $5.1 billion, up 4%. As for cloud margins, our SaaS business continues to scale and grow and the gross margin has expanded to 66% up from 59% last Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and we remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins. The gross margin of PaaS and IaaS was 40%, down from 44% last quarter as our geographic buildout goes forward in response to demand but ahead of the bulk of new revenue recognition. When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margin. Hardware revenues were $940 million, down 9%, and service revenues were $856 million, essentially unchanged in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total non-GAAP revenue for the company were $9.6 billion, up 4% from last year and 6% in U.S. dollars. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, 10% in U.S. dollars. The operating margin was 44%, which was up from 42% last year. The operating margins have now increased year over year for five consecutive quarters and while I can\u2019t promise this will happen every quarter, I do expect that operating margins will continue to expand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was slightly higher than expected at 25.2%. As a result, EPS was $0.01 less at $0.70 a share in U.S. dollars, up 14% in U.S. dollars, 12% in CD. The GAAP tax rate was 22.1% and GAAP EPS was $0.52.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $599 million. I expect the cloud CapEx spending would be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS/IaaS buildout that I mentioned earlier. Obviously, should we see higher than expected ARR growth, we\u2019d expect to see higher CapEx investments as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now we have more than $71 billion in cash and marketable securities but net of debt our cash position is $10.9 billion. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency. This quarter we repurchased nearly 41 million shares for a total of $2 billion. Over the last 12 months we\u2019ve repurchased 74.5 million shares for a total of $3.5 billion. We also paid out dividends of nearly $3 billion. The Board of Directors increased the authorization for share repurchases by $12 billion and again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to the guidance for Q3. My guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency. However, there has been some currency movement and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue or $0.03 positive on EPS. So, for Q3 in constant currency, Cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS are expected to grow 21% to 25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Total revenues is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.70. That puts the USD earnings per share at $0.71, and $0.73. This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere around 24%. Of course with the current and very real possibility of tax reform, the Q3 tax rate could easily end up being very different especially to the extent that there is repatriation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I will turn over to Mark for his comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mark Hurd</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Safra.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Really, a solid quarter for Oracle from top to bottom. Just a few numbers. USD revenue was up 6%. Software and Cloud revenue was up 9%. Operating income was up 10%. Net income was up 16%. EPS grew 14%. That\u2019s three quarters in a row where EPS growth has been over double digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Safra\u2019s point about our apps ecosystem, our application revenue was up 13%. That is a GAAP CD number. We\u2019re growing roughly three times as fast as the market. I\u2019ve seen market numbers of two, three, three-and-a-half, so depending on how you look at those numbers we\u2019re more than three times as fast as the market, maybe for with nearly 90% of that revenue being recurring on a trailing 12-month basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">SaaS bookings was a strong quarter for us. We grew 42% in USD. That 42% accelerated meaning the growth rate was higher that prior year. PaaS revenue was up 47% and over $4.5 billion annualized run rate. ERP was up 66% organically. Overall ERP is now at $1.4 billion annual run rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fusion HCM up 77%, more than double the growth rate of Workday. CX double-digit growth with CX now at $1.1 billion annualized run rate. Data-as-a-Service, up 47%. Our verticals were up 19%. That\u2019s on a compare of last year\u2019s growth of 125%. Our technology ecosystem that\u2019s on-premise license, on-premise support and our PaaS and infrastructure revenue altogether was up 4% with solid cloud growth and new software license which was essentially flat in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of our platform and infrastructure revenue that was up 20%. Now there are couple of things to call out here. As was mentioned first inside our PaaS and infrastructure is the legacy hosting business which is declining. Second, we have Oracle Cloud Machine revenue which is not yet reported, which we discussed last quarter. If you put it altogether the 49% growth Safra mentioned earlier, if all that Oracle cloud machine had been provisioned our revenue growth rate would\u2019ve been above 55% in USD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Business analytics was up 104%, data integration up 88%, storage and compute infrastructure as a service both up triple digits. Cloud revenue grew 41% in USD now over a $6 billion run rate and 80% of that trailing 12 months software and cloud revenue is now recurring. Our cloud deferred revenue was up 33%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not just closing looking forward we\u2019re executing well on a big and our pipeline is the biggest we\u2019ve ever had and we expect to sell around $2 billion in SaaS ARR over the next four quarters, that being the second half of 2018 and the first half of fiscal 2019. Lastly, this was again another solid quarter from top line growth of 6% USD all the way down to the bottom at 14% EPS growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to give you a few customer names, wins, we had in the quarter and I\u2019ll just try to run through these quickly. But I think it\u2019s important for you to hear these brand names. In ERP cloud Adventist Health, AXA, Banco Santander, Pasha Bank, City of Las Vegas, Club Core, Emirates Airlines, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, John Hancock, Johnson Controls, Mattel, News Corp, Wessar Motor, Sumitomo Heavy Industries, The Bank of Nova Scotia, UCLA, Williams-Sonoma.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In HCM, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, Association Generale, BioWare and Pharmaceuticals, Chicago Transit Authority, The City of Atlanta, Deutsche Post, Emblem Health, Emirates Air, Henry Ford Health Systems, Mars, Shell, Southwestern Energy Company, Treasury Wine Estate, Williams-Sonoma.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a couple on the infrastructure and platform side, Akamai, Alliance, Arconic, Baptist Healthcare System, City of Palm Beach, CVS, Los Angeles County, Orange, Softbank, Tellier, University of Durham, U.S. Census Bureau, Oil Fuel Services, Z\u00fcrich Insurance Group, a lot of logos. I could\u2019ve gone for a lot longer, but I just wanted to give you some context of the sorts of brands that are buying our cloud technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, Larry\u2019s got some comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Larry Ellison</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This coming January, Oracle will deliver the world\u2019s first autonomous database. We expect this innovative new technology to dramatically accelerate the growth of our PaaS and SaaS businesses and keep our database license business strong as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">People are buying database licenses to run on premise and in the cloud. You can run them either place. Their buying options to run on premise and in the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on machine learning, the new autonomous version of the Oracle database is totally automated, a self-driving system that does not require human beings to either manage or tune the database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Using artificial intelligence to eliminate most sources of human error, the Oracle Autonomous Database delivers an unprecedented 99.995% system availability. That\u2019s less than 30 minutes of planned or unplanned downtime per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To achieve that level of reliability, the Oracle Autonomous Database automatically tunes and upgrades itself without human intervention. If a security vulnerability is detected, the database automatically and immediately detaches itself while the system is running. AWS databases can\u2019t do any of this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Even more compelling is the cost comparison between running the Oracle autonomous database versus running an Amazon database like Redshift. In a series of published benchmark tests the Amazon Redshift database on average costs five times more to run the same exact amount of work as the Oracle Autonomous Database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me repeat that. If you take a workload from Amazon running on Redshift and move it over to Oracle, your Amazon bill will drop by 80%. It will cost you five times more to run Redshift than to run the Oracle Autonomous. And this is not total cost of ownership, this is not labor, this is not - this is your Amazon bill, what you pay Amazon to do a piece of work, you can run on the Oracle cloud and pay $.20 on the dollar by moving from Amazon to Oracle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re so confident of our cost advantages over Amazon that Oracle will provide our customers with written service level agreements that guarantee, that guarantee moving to the Oracle cloud will cut Amazon customer\u2019s database bills in half or substantially more than half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could we please go to Q&amp;A?</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Moerdler, Sanford Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could you give us a better sense of what exactly is driving clients select between Oracle\u2019s private cloud, Oracle infrastructure service, Oracle PaaS, on-premise? Why is it taking longer right now [indiscernible] rollout? And then a quick follow-up question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Why it\u2019s taking longer, to provision the Oracle cloud machine, it\u2019s the responsibility of Oracle to deliver the cloud machines and the cloud software and then the customers, then we have to actually install these cloud machines in the customer's data center and hook up to the customer\u2019s network.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And every customer is a little bit different. So it takes us a certain amount of time to configure the system on Oracle's side. But the big thing is now the customer has to get the appropriate networking gear and connect the Oracle cloud machine into their network. And that's what's proven to take longer than we had first anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have a bit of a backlog on that. But it\u2019s a matter of, again, easy for us to shift. Everyone receives the same cloud hardware. That\u2019s easy for us to do. Everyone receives the same cloud software. But connecting it in the customer data center can vary from data center to data center and that\u2019s what\u2019s taking the extra time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good news, Mark, is we sold a lot and we\u2019re in the process of implementing those as we speak and I tried to give them my comments that we would\u2019ve had a significant improvement in growth rate win if those had been provisioned and they\u2019ll get provisioned shortly. So it\u2019s been a very successful launch for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Moerdler</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excellent, very helpful. As a quick follow up, what\u2019s the use cases for Oracle Cloud Machine versus infrastructure as a service, et cetera?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, listen, the good thing is it\u2019s sort of all of our technologies when you start it. So we have customers that use it for ERP, for HCM, and it really, Mark, fits more into markets where the industries we have regulatory issues. So if you get into banking and pharma, you have more of these security issues, I won\u2019t go through all of them in detail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so in many cases, it\u2019s easier for some of the big banks, some of the big Pharma companies and frankly, even in telecommunications where you see it\u2019s easier to get through those regs, we\u2019ll just take all the advantages of the cloud. So let me just go through this, Mark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You get really all of the price advantages, you\u2019re buying variably. We do all of the work, we do all of the patching. The customer really doesn\u2019t touch this so they get the benefits of cloud on one hand while not having to deal with some of what the regulatory issues might be on the other hand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The downside is what Larry went through. We have to actually physically go in and implement this and there\u2019s some extra work that might be done as opposed to just hooking up directly into our cloud. Does that help you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Heather Bellini</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mark, you mentioned in your comments that you\u2019re going to do $2 billion in new SaaS ARR over the next year. I was wondering if you could help us think about how this translates into SaaS revenue growth trend as we look out over the same time period? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of things. One, I was not trying to confuse what I thought this year\u2019s fiscal bookings in cloud would be with rolling four quarters, SaaS, ARR bookings would be. So those are two separate numbers and I\u2019m glad the way you worded it because I must\u2019ve said it right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The $2 billion is a forward-looking next rolling four quarters of SaaS bookings and I think that\u2019s more than anybody is going to be even close to that sort of bookings number but obviously we\u2019ll see. So we think that\u2019s going to be very, very aggressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What is going to happen on the overall ecosystem? As you probably know, and I know I\u2019ve said before, most of what\u2019s in our revenue base today did not come from our on-prem user base. Most came from competitors or came from companies that really are in their first set of application, midmarket companies, fast growth companies, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So what I think does happen is just to make sure you understand, I think we said it before, but Oracle actually goes live on cloud financials right at the turn of the calendar year. So our e-business suite base, which is not the predominant piece of our cloud SaaS base, will see this as a big, big move. So we are hopeful when you talk what the entire ecosystem that actually we\u2019ll start to see a higher degree of Oracle\u2019s user base moving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I want to emphasize again, that is a good thing. We get materially more revenue when a customer moves from support of their existing on-prem applications to now SaaS. And that is roughly three times or more ARR and the three times, I want to emphasize again, is the equivalent of a like-for-like support compared to their new applications in the cloud. So what do I expect to happen in the ecosystem? I think the ecosystem actually grows faster as a result of everything I described. Most of our base today did not come from the Oracle base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Oracle base now with more and more references to move certainly our latest releases which are now in release 13, more feature-rich than anything obviously we\u2019ve ever had before, Heather, and as that support base moves to cloud, we actually get more revenue and, as a result, the ecosystem grows faster.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Brad Zelnick, Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I've got one for Mark and a quick follow up for Safra. Mark, Oracle has been maintaining share when we consider the entire database ecosystem, but we keep hearing competitors and surveys saying customers are moving off Oracle. Can you maybe share some firsthand customer perspectives and frame the value of what lives in Oracle database that isn\u2019t going anywhere versus the type of stuff we might be hearing about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d like to answer that. Let me tell you who\u2019s not moving off of Oracle. A company you\u2019ve heard of just give us another $50 million this quarter to buy Oracle database and other Oracle technology. That company is Amazon. They\u2019re not moving off of Oracle. Sales force isn\u2019t moving off of Oracle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our competitors who have no reason to like us very much continue to invest in and run their entire business on Oracle. I don\u2019t know whose moving off of Oracle. Maybe Mark does, maybe Safra does, but Amazon, you\u2019d think Amazon would really want to move. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me tell you someone else who\u2019s not moving off of Oracle, SAP. They had that database called HANA they\u2019d like to move to. SuccessFactors, they\u2019ve been trying to move off of Oracle for five or six years. SAP is running on Oracle. Ariba runs an Oracle. All SAP large customers run on Oracle. Amazon continues to buy Oracle technology to run their business. Salesforce runs entirely on Oracle. Go ahead, you tell me who\u2019s moving off of Oracle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brad, thanks for the question. So a couple of points. Listen, I think when this comes up, I\u2019d like to just go back to the math and just go back to the numbers. We\u2019ve got sort of every other database being used just in shared terms is ours. And when you see us throwing up yet again another growth rate above market, it\u2019s just any of these sort of stories, anecdotes - by the way, I\u2019ve heard them for seven years, right? It predates me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, you know, everybody\u2019s moving off the Oracle database or what you think of this guy or that guy? And the latest guy, somebody told me, what do you think of \u2013 what\u2019s that company? MongoDB. I said the only thing I remember about MongoDB is three numbers: 100, 200, 100.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s their revenue 100, 200 were their expenses, and 100 was their losses. And so I have that implanted in my brain and the $100 million as a part of $40 billion seems really small to me. I don\u2019t know. Maybe different, your math, your numerate as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I just look at our numbers and I look at us growing faster than market and it\u2019s now been going on a while. By the way, an important thing to notice, I don\u2019t really care whether we denominate that in platforms of service or, if you will, databases of service, licenses, Larry went into one example of a license deal, and/or database support. And I think when you look at that aggregated ecosystem, I guess with the stories, I just love somebody show up with something more than a story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just show up with a number and all we do is keep showing up every single quarter with math that says, okay, could be true but whether Larry is talking about what Redshift, I brought up this other guy. Just look at the list of competitors out there and I just don\u2019t see growth rates that certainly nobody gaining share over us. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not swapping share with each other and maybe they\u2019ve got a story about this or that but when you just look at overall numbers we\u2019re gaining share in database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brad Zelnick</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s really helpful to hear you frame it and hear it first hand from you. Just really quick really for you, Safra, can you please remind us of your view on CapEx spending this year? And does the deceleration of CapEx spend in the quarter signal anything around future PaaS/IaaS revenue? Thanks again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think our capital expenditures will be very similar to last year. As I mentioned to you last year, we spent about $1 billion in kind of CapEx associated with the cloud. We spent about $1 billion in our real estate expansion. And the way that CapEx works really is there\u2019s a certain amount when we open data centers, and that cost quite a bit to just get started.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the buildout is a little bit less because there\u2019s abasing starting block. So I think we -\u2013 and what happens is you start to get really major economies of scale as you \u2013 once your setup is basically set up, straight and ready to go. So I see it like last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A lot of growth, about half of it is in real estate which I don\u2019t expect to continue necessarily as much on that side. So no, no deceleration, just trying to get some economies of scale as we build out. We\u2019ve got some plans but nothing. Now the revenues are coming in so that\u2019s why we\u2019re having the improvements in margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Adam Holt, MoffettNathanson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Adam Holt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you will know, I\u2019ve been highly focused on your maintenance revenue of all things and this was the strongest license quarter we\u2019ve seen in really a long time. Can you talk a little bit, was it just the BYOL that drove the license revenue in the quarter? And shouldn\u2019t the stronger relative license revenue start to drive maintenance a little bit even faster?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, absolutely. So it\u2019s not only BYOL. It\u2019s also in preparation for Autonomous Database. So understand that to get the benefit of Autonomous Database in the Oracle cloud, you bring your own license, but you may also, you will also need depending on which service you need, you\u2019re going to need some of the options in addition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And also, as you bring your own database licenses, you\u2019re going to want to have app server licenses and middleware licenses in order to work with your database. So all of that, that BYOL is a fundamental change and is significantly different from how SaaS works.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s what I try to explain. In SaaS, you are now doing a SaaS subscription, you\u2019re no longer using your license. You don\u2019t need to buy more licenses, and you shelve your support. With BYOL, you buy additional licenses, you bring them to our cloud and you continue to pay support. And that is going to be very significant going forward. And it\u2019s already, you already see it in this quarter already. And we announced it in OpenWorld. OpenWorld.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Adam Holt</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I could just ask a follow up on that because I\u2019m getting a lot of questions about this and I just want a point of clarification. Is there any kind of a lag between people buying the licenses and renewing maintenance first, and then moving to the cloud? Because I think what some of us are trying to reconcile is the cloud guidance is a little bit slower than it has been. So it looks like something might be decelerating a little bit, and I just want to understand, is there a gap as people maybe buy licenses on premise? And then maybe it\u2019s a quarter or two before they deploy in the cloud? Just trying to understand those mechanics. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The mechanics are not automatic, so let\u2019s actually set this up. What has clearly happened, and I could already see this even at OpenWorld in talking to customers, they now understand that they will want to have more licenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So as their unlimited agreements are starting to expire, they could have historically pick up. I\u2019m going to rent all my licenses going forward, there\u2019s no point in owning them, they would\u2019ve certify those licenses and stopped buying additional and renewing unlimited agreements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So what they\u2019ve now seen is there pathway with BYOL gives them complete flexibility of when they are ready to move to the cloud, but that there\u2019s a benefit in owning your licenses and buying more and renewing support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So customers moved to the cloud when it makes sense for them. Autonomous Database, which is coming out in a little while here, that\u2019s going to be an enormous driver for customers to actually move there important workloads to the cloud. You understand? The two are related, but not the same. Larry, I don\u2019t if you want to...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Larry Ellison</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I'll just chime in very briefly. Yes, they buy the license first, and a lot of customers are waiting for the Autonomous Database to become available. So we\u2019ve seen a big uptick in renewals of ULA, these unlimited license agreements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The sale of certain options that are required for the Autonomous Database, that\u2019s specifically rack and multi-tenant. The multi-tenant option those two options, and the high reliability option is called Active Data Guard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So all of those customers are buying those and then the Autonomous Database then rolls-out and begins to scale in January. So a lot of customers will have their first experience \u2013 the first big move of Oracle customers databases to the cloud really will begin in January.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s been no big migration anyplace of Oracle databases into anyone\u2019s cloud, including ours. There\u2019s been some, but it\u2019s a relatively very, very small business. This all begins to happen starting in January, where the capabilities of cloud are so much better. Or the economics in the cloud are so much better than what\u2019s available on premise, that we think our customers are going to move very, very rapidly to the cloud. But they are waiting for our Autonomous Database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Safra, just a follow up for you on bringing your license and the subscription revenue versus license. Obviously you talk about the benefit of the license here and we saw in this quarter, and obviously we have seen on the total revenue guidance had a consensus for next quarter, but as Amit just pointed out cloud below. I wonder if you could help us just sort of walk through. It seems like obviously you\u2019re pouring more water into the license bucket, sort of less on a relative basis, than in the cloud. Just because obviously PaaS versus IaaS is probably 40% less for IaaS than PaaS. Could you just help us walk through the math kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the impact of BYO kind of on those two buckets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So there are a few things going on here. Remember, when you bring your own license to Oracle IaaS, the service you purchase is more expensive than the basic IaaS because you get all of the autonomous \u2013 all of the capability you wouldn\u2019t otherwise get, first of all. But you cannot divorce the margin of just IaaS without remembering that both licenses are being purchased, and support is continuously paid. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s why you heard me say, maybe you heard me say, the so-called on-premise license, because it\u2019s actually now that we\u2019ve launched BYOL, it is actually a misnomer because the customer \u2013 it\u2019s currently categorized on our income statement as on-premise software and support, for that matter. Those are called on premise, but there\u2019s nothing on premise about them. You can bring them to the cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you have to understand how much money in that pool because with SaaS on the applications side, remember, we don\u2019t sell you a new license, you no longer renew your support, and you start renting SaaS licenses and the service all bundled together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in this case, to the extent that - and, by the way, I just want to be clear, customers have the option if they don\u2019t want to bring their own license, to buy, to rent licenses through PaaS. That\u2019s also available to them. But financially for both them and us, it actually works out best if they bring those licenses and those with unlimited agreements can bring an unlimited amount of licenses to our cloud as well as continue to use whatever they\u2019ve got still on premise at their own state while continuing to pay support and buying additional licenses. So the math is more complete and very profitable for both us and the customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Philip Winslow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just shows up in different places. Understood. And just a very quick follow up for Mark on the cloud machine. Obviously, you called out that there\u2019s a deployment lag there and that it sort of cost you 6 points of reported growth. Just curious what customers are saying to you about cloud machine versus the BYOL to the public cloud. Just any comments there about sort of the success you\u2019re seeing. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, our strategy has been to give the customer choice. So to the point that Safra is bringing up, you have a choice to using whatever currency you\u2019d like. You can buy as a license, which means the customer buys one time as a traditional license transaction and can bring that to the cloud. And you can bring to the cloud a couple of different ways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you\u2019re in one of these highly regulated environments like I described, you can bring it to the cloud, utilizing the cloud machine, which is a very effective way of getting most of the benefits of the cloud without having to go through some of the hoops I described a few minutes ago. Or you can bring that license all the way to the Oracle public cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some customers, frankly, use it as a continuum because, back to Larry\u2019s earlier point about the autonomous database, it isn\u2019t just about the flexibility of how you pay for it, the benefits now, most of our customers now have the opportunity with the Autonomous Database to simply get out of patching. That may sound like a really trivial issue when you say it on a conference call with an analyst.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is huge to all our customers. I sit in rooms with CEOs talking but how the heck do I get out of this damn patching? Some of our customers have 12-month lag time between the release of a patch and when they can get it implemented, the release of a patch from us and when they get it implemented. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This Autonomous Database actually eliminates all of that. It eliminates all of the labor they may have on premise, actually DBAs and so forth that are actually running these databases. And we\u2019re trying to give the customer we think now exactly what they want. They can take advantage of this either on premise, they can now take advantage of the Oracle cloud in their data center with the cloud machine, or they bring it to the Oracle public cloud. And if you want to buy it as a license, you want to buy it as a cloud service, it\u2019s totally up to you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s been our strategy, Phil. And frankly, to Safra\u2019s point about the economic model, we\u2019re fine either way the customer wants to do it. And so that\u2019s our strategy. And I think, my opinion for what it\u2019s worth, is whether that shows up in a license and then brought to our cloud, that\u2019s great for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Whether deployed on the cloud machine, and granted Larry\u2019s point about the latency between order booking and eventual deployment, it is what it is for a short period of time, but that\u2019s just yet another thing that differentiates us from what anybody else can do in the market today. I hope that helps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Sarah Hindlian, Macquarie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Sarah Hindlian</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is really one thing I want to ask Safra that you mentioned, which was tax repatriation and possible implications of the Tax Code changes here in the U.S. I\u2019d love to hear more about how Oracle is thinking about it and different ways you can deploy your balance sheet. If you could expand on your earlier comments, that would be very much appreciated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, to the extent that repatriation is part of the final bill, and to the extent that whatever is the rate for the cash that we bring back, either what we actually have or the deemed repatriation, that will make available to us under $60 billion, depending on the tax of cash that we can use for whatever would be available for us. We haven\u2019t made any decisions about how we would use it. I believe that it is mandatory repatriation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, a tax will be due on all cash outside the United States for all of those companies, and I believe we\u2019d need to book it, or at least book an estimate for it in the quarter that the tax law changes. That will make our tax rate look sort of strange, but, of course, I\u2019ll disclose the amounts and all that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m not sure that the final rate has been set, and, whether it will actually stay in the bill. So, we hope it does. We hope they do move to a territorial system. It will make us more competitive, and we look forward to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question will come from the line of Kirk Materne, Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kirk Materne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mark, I want to jump over the applications business really quickly. Just could you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment, especially around ERP and HCM and sort of what\u2019s underpinning your confidence in sort of the ARR growth numbers over the next year in that space? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, first of all, underpinning my\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kirk Materne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your $2 billion outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, well as I\u2019ve said several times, I really look through starting with like just our pipeline, so our pipeline is bigger than it\u2019s actually \u2013 or actually growth in pipeline, Kirk, is just as it sits this second towards the end of the year, is just superb. I don\u2019t want to go farther than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m just really pleased with the progress in the number of opportunities we\u2019re getting to participate in. And that gets to the competitive dynamics. If a customer wants SAS ERP, there really isn\u2019t a competitive dynamic. So, it\u2019s really us. So, we really lead in that category. And the reason we lead is because there\u2019s nobody else. Full stop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to the degree in HCM, that HCM is combined with an ERP, which is becoming more and more the fashion of what you\u2019re seeing, then we\u2019re obviously significantly advantaged. We have a competitor in SAS HCM. We don\u2019t have a competitor in SAS ERP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, the other thing I\u2019d say that\u2019s at issue is for us, over the last couple of years, is getting out of our traditional base. We\u2019re getting better and better at now \u2013 because historically if you went back six, seven years ago, we\u2019d typically call on the Oracle base of customers and the other traditional older on-premise ERP company SAP. Once you bought SAP, once you bought Oracle, those people didn\u2019t move calling on the other customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s all changing now. So now as customers get more aware of the difference between a traditional on-premise ERP and a new modern SAS ERP, we get a chance now to compete for their, these competitor customers that frankly, we hadn\u2019t had a chance to compete for, if you will, in the older generation of applications. So, I don\u2019t if that helps in the dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By the way, those dynamics changed, because all of us usually on this call think about the United States of America. The farther you get from the United States of America, the better the dynamics become for us. Because of our global distribution, because of our global footprint, because of our global presence, because of our global references, because of our ability to deploy in multiple SAS data centers around the world, we\u2019re even more advantaged with the farther away you get from the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m optimistic because we have great products. We got a competitive product lead in the most important application segment in the world which is ERP. We\u2019re about to go live with our applications internally and financials which now we\u2019ve already gone live with HCM. We\u2019ve gone live with other applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now we\u2019ll have our flagship product automating Oracle. We\u2019re just in a great position. I know that sounds like hype and I actually believe this. So this is what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and one of the reasons why in our company, if you\u2019re inside our company, in our apps group, you feel the sort of confidence and swagger that you see around our apps group today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our final question will come from the line of Kash Rangan, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple of questions for Safra. One, Safra, do you think as the business continues to get scale, that operating income growth rate can continue to accelerate and outpace revenue? And secondly, just sort of a clarification, when you look at the guidance for cloud growth rate and kind of correlate that against what Mark said with respect to SaaS ARR bookings growth which looks to me about 40%, 50%. If you back that out of your cloud guidance for Q3, it looks like the IaaS/PaaS business, maybe it\u2019s a temporary thing as down to slightly flattish. So I just want to clarify that\u2019s the way we should be modeling the two different line items and how we should be interpreting your cloud guidance. Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For your first question, yes, I think that operating income is going to grow faster than revenue because we get economies of scale, we have margin improvement, and the business is growing. And when it grows, we get economies of scale that allow us to grow income, operating income faster than revenues. And I\u2019m quite sure of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think you should not confuse bookings with revenue, and PaaS and IaaS forecast looks good. I\u2019m not giving you \u2013 I\u2019m not breaking them down for you, but I expect them to be positive and consistent with what you would have seen. And just as a reminder, the PaaS/IaaS includes a piece that is not growing and a piece that is growing. The piece that\u2019s not growing is like 200 something, 240 \u2013 I can\u2019t remember.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to try to help, I think the right word that Safra used is consistent. You should think of it being roughly the same in growth rate as you saw cash and the legacy piece is $0.5 billion, roughly speaking, annualized. So that would give you some help I think for the scale of the business. Actually, maybe a little more that but it\u2019s roughly right, Kash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kash Rangan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the comparables will get easier next year. I would think that for PaaS and IaaS you should start to resume that growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Mark Hurd</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No question about it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Safra Catz</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No question because the PaaS/IaaS that we care about, the one we\u2019re focused on is growing 40 something percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Ken Bond for closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ken Bond</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Holly.
