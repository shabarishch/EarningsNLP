By all measures 2023 was another successful year. Thanks to the hard work and dedication from Linde employees around the world. And despite the economic and geopolitical challenges, Linde once again delivered on its commitments with industry-leading results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I\u2019ve said before, this doesn\u2019t happen by accident. It\u2019s daily grind across the entire organization underpinned by our disciplined operating rhythm, an important tenet of this rhythm is to maintain a results-driven culture by having consistently focus on performance metrics that drives shareholder value. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 3 provides an overview of build areas I view as critical to running a leading industrial gas company. It starts with people. We have a top notch team who run the safe, reliable and efficient industrial gas company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During 2023, we made meaningful progress towards our goal of highly engaged diverse workforce and further supported community as we operate in, all while maintaining world-class safety results. I would like to thank our employees around the world for delivering these results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Supporting the environment is more than just lip service at Linde. We\u2019ve been working on it for decades. Last year we reduced absolute greenhouse gas emissions while increasing our active renewable energy purchases by 1 terrawatt hour. It\u2019s a good start towards our long-term goals and I am pleased to see acknowledgement of this progress in or external recognition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also positioned the business with high-quality future growth. The OCI project with CapEx of approximately $2 billion will produce 300 million cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen which will be sold under standard industrial gas supply contracts while partnering with Exxon Mobile for CO2 sequestration. And I continue to be confident about winning new backlog projects in the US, Europe, Middle East and Asia Pacific worth around $8 billion to $10 billion in the next three years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Recently there have been some updates and indeed some confusion regarding the IRA regulations. We\u2019ve included a slide in the backup to help explain our views. I am happy to respond to any questions on it, but let me reiterate the key message. We expect future US onsite clean hydrogen projects to primarily leverage 45 Q credits since we have not yet identified any large onsite green hydrogen projects that meets our investment criteria. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I expect to see small to mid-size green hydrogen projects, primarily to serve merchant type demand, that these will likely not meet our backlog definition. Aside from clean energy projects we continue to position the base business routes as evidenced by our traditional onsite merchant small onsite investments. Indeed why you\u2019ll see we have one of the new records.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, we delivered on the numbers. After all, management\u2019s primary purpose is to be a steward of shareholder capital. We\u2019ve listed a few key accomplishments. But I believe the four most important financial metrics to create shareholder value can be found on the next slide. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s easy for management to get distracted by a myriad of financial metrics through which performance can be measured. However, one cannot lose sight of the ultimate objective to increase shareholder value which can best be represented by total shareholder return or TSR. From my perspective, the best way to deliver superior TSR is to have industry-leading results and EPS growth, operating cash flow growth, operating profit margins and return on capital. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">ROC and operating margin demonstrate the quality and health of the business. And while both have theoretical limits, sustaining them at leading levels while growing EPS and OCS is the best combination for compound value creations. Each chart shows the five year trend against two members in the industry. Linde has led all of them, in some cases by a wide margin. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We maintained leadership despite volatile economic and geopolitical conditions including unprecedented global events. Linde is an investment for all seasons and I think these charts demonstrates that. But what about the shareholders? How about metrics that impacted TSR, all you can find them on the next slide. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This graph shows the five year TSR for Linde through members of our industry and the S&amp;P 500 index. The first observation is that Linde has far exceeded all three, with almost double the shareholder return. But equally important, Linde is one of only 12 companies in the entire S&amp;P 500 to deliver positive outflow for five successive years, and the only company in our sector to do so. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During good years and bad, Linde consistently outperformed the benchmarks to reward our owners. The performance culture and the corresponding compensation programs at Linde are designed to optimize these four metrics at all levels of the organization. Year after year, we\u2019ve proven how we positively correlate to superior TSR and positive outcomes, two important ways to gauge shareholder value creation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Because of this, I remain confident in our ability to continue creating long-term shareholder value regardless of the economy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt to walk you through our financial results. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt White</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Sanjiv. Slide 6 provides a summary of fourth quarter results. Sales of $8.3 billion grew 5% over prior year and 2% sequentially. Versus prior year, the sales declined 3% from contractual cost pass through due to lower energy prices in EMEA and Americas, which has no effect on profit. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Foreign currency translation was a 2% tailwind from a weaker US dollar. Acquisitions improved 1% from the nexAir packaged gas purchase. And Engineering increased 1% from project backlog execution. Excluding these items, underlying sales increased 4% from higher prices, which continue to track with globally weighted inflation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Year-over-year volumes were flat as contribution from the project backlog was offset by softer base volumes, primarily in EMEA. Versus the third quarter, sales grew 2% from engineering project timing. Underlying sales were sequentially flat as higher prices offset seasonally lower volumes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, economic conditions have been stagnant as the estimated industrial production growth for our weighted countries was close to 0% for the fourth quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating profit of $2.3 billion was 14% above last year and resulted in a 27.4% operating margin. Excluding cost pass-through, operating margins expanded 130 basis points from last year, but declined 80 basis points sequentially driven by EMEA and engineering. The EMEA trend mostly relates to seasonality, but engineering margins are returning to the normal runrate of low to mid teens percent as we begin to lap the impact from sanctioned projects. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, I still expect global operating margins to expand in the future including 2024. I also like to point out a one-time unfavorable impact embedded in this quarter\u2019s results related to the Argentinean peso which devalued over 50%. As a hyper inflationary country, we recorded a charge of $10 million to the Americas operating profit and another $20 million to the interest line, or about $0.05 of total EPS. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This impact is not reflected in the sales FX translation summary as it only impacts other operating income and net interest. We fully expect to recover this over time as our pricing aligns with the subsequent local inflation. EPS at $3.59 was 14% above last year as pricing net of cost inflation, backlog contribution and a lower share count more than offset lower base volumes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The 1% sequential decline was primarily driven by seasonal factors and the devaluation of the Argentinean peso. Disciplined capital management is a hallmark of Linde\u2019s stewardship and 2023 was no exception. Return on capital finished over 25% against the backdrop of healthy operating cash flow. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 7 provides further details on full year capital allocation performance. Operating cash flow of $9.3 billion grew 5% over prior year despite the significant working capital outflows related to wind down of engineering projects. Most of this had passed which have enabled a future OCF to EBITDA ratio in the low to mid 80% range. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the right, you can see uses of cash, which is consistent with our longstanding capital allocation policy of an underlying mandate to maintain a single A rating, while growing the dividend, a priority to invest in projects which meet our criteria, and the opportunity to sweep all remaining capital toward share repurchases. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that approach, we returned $6.4 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases while investing $4.7 billion back into the business. But investing in the business is much more than just a dollar number. One of the most important responsibilities of management is to ensure capital is invested for an appropriate risk weighted return. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Across Linde, we understand this concept and have integrated it into the culture, so our owners can sleep well at night. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll wrap up with guidance on Slide 8. We are initiating 2024 full year EPS guidance at $15.25 to $15.65 or 8% to 11% growth when excluding an assumed 1% FX headwind. Consistent with prior approach, this assumes no economic improvement at the midpoint. Therefore, if the economy grows there would be upside and if there is a recession, we\u2019ll take actions to maintain this range. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the first quarter, this translates to a range of $3.58 to $3.68 or a 6% to 9% EPS growth excluding FX. While the economic assumption is similar to the full year, the first quarter is traditionally our lightest due to seasonal factors. Heroes aren\u2019t made in February. So we believe it\u2019s appropriate to remain cautious that\u2019s early in the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">However, regardless of what 2024 brings, investors can rest assured that we will manage what matters most to create shareholder value. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Q&amp;A. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-And-Answer Session </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Duffy Fischer </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, good morning, guys. Question just around China, both on industrial and also electronics and we seem to be getting different cost trends from different companies as they report kind of what the outlook is. Could you share with us what you view as kind of the first path outlook for both industrial production, your end-markets there, and electronics?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Duffy. Let me just start off by a quick reminder that China is about 7% of our total sales and profits just as a baseline and that of course is spread across various customers in every possible end-market that we have. So, you would recall we spoken about China in weakness and slow recovery over there, I think all of last year in fact. And now that this should really come as a surprise. We\u2019ve been seeing China being a little bit softer and we\u2019ve kind of tracked that for at least 6 to 9 months for now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve also as a result of that taken some actions in the country already as you would expect us to. So all of that\u2019s already in place. Now let\u2019s talk about the outlook for 2024. As far as industrials go, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve seen a lack of momentum. We talked about it last year. We see the same carry through into 2024 for most parts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll walk you through some end-markets just to give you a sense of what\u2019s going on. Some are little bit stronger than others, but broadly I think we don\u2019t quite see China recovering at a pace at which we would have expected it to. In end-markets let me just kind of mention chemicals to start over. They did have a solid Q4. It is of course weighed down by the fact that construction is a little bit slower. But all in, the market was in a reasonable shape and we expect maybe a mild recovery towards the first half of this year and then maybe a pick up towards second half. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steel, which is the other major market that we\u2019ve been talking about has been shrinking for a while. In fact crude, steel in Q4 shrank about 4%. Some of that was administrative control because it wanted to hold on their annual capacities if you will. Don\u2019t expect anything to happen on steel. It is really driven around the property market and the property market recovery is not foreseen in 2024. So we expect steel to just muddy along for most part of this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Manufacturing generally has been a bit lackluster, but there are some bright spots within that. Automobile for instance have shown some good growth in Q4, up about 17%. EV a large part of that. Batteries up a little bit as well. Solar cells up a little bit as well. Other than this I\u2019d say, again manufacturing has been largely flattish beyond that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as electronics is concerned, electronics saw a little bit of a recovery in Q4. Again remember, the thing to watch out in electronics is less about what is happening on capacities and more about the kind of escalation in geopolitical risk that comes with electronics in China, in particular at this point in time. And again, our view is you will see continued mild recovery probably through the first half of the year and then the second half we\u2019ll have to just watch and see what happens. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Duffy Fischer </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you, guys. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019ll take our next question from \u2013 [Audio Disconnect]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You should expect us to continue to see pricing actions that we take. We talk about pricing as being management action that something that we do every day and that process and discipline that follows I think is what makes the pricing mechanism so strong and robust for us. You should expect us to see that continue through in 2024 and you should see that reflected in margins which should continue to see some improvement as we go into 2024. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Zekauskas </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks very much. In terms of your outlook for 2024, is global industrial production is roughly flat? And you have new projects coming on stream? Should your base case volume be up 2% or 3%? And then if you can comment on whether Russia is now producing more helium that was before?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I\u2019ll just quickly comment on Russia very quickly to tell you that we\u2019ve come out of our contracts that are more \u2013 that were previously there and therefore really we aren\u2019t in a position to comment on what happens in Russia as far as helium production is concerned. There is lot of speculation around, but Jeff, as you know and I think at this point in time, I\u2019ll probably reserve to comment on that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As far as outlook is concerned, I might just want to take you back to our guidance. As you know, we\u2019ve said in our guidance that we see at the midpoint of the guidance zero help from the economy and we kind of maintain that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your point on backlog contribution, again as a reminder on EPS growth that we see, our backlog contribution ranges from 1% to 2% for 2024. I see that at the top end of that range. You know the other levers well, but I\u2019ll reiterate them just quickly as well as a recap. We see share buybacks and share count obviously help us at the EPS growth level by about two percentage points. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the rest is all about management action as far as pricing, productivity and total cost management is concerned, that\u2019s what brings up the rest to take us to a midpoint of 10 plus percent EPS growth for 2024. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jeff Zekauskas </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you so much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Tony Jones with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tony Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. In your prepared remarks, you sort of highlighted that large green hydrogen projects and not where you are likely to be at least for the foreseeable future. Could you just explain why is it sort of price, you focused on price and long-term take or pay contracts, the criteria is not quite as tight? That will be very helpful. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Tony, so what we\u2019ve said very clearly is our belief is that the electrolyzer technology that ensures that green hydrogen is produced, it requires a couple of things to happen for it to get to a point where we will see large onsite green hydrogen projects. Right, the distinction I am making here is large onsite green hydrogen projects. I\u2019ll talk a bit about the small and midsized in a minute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So two things need to happen on the electrolyzer technology. One is that it needs to improve in terms of its reliability and the ability to operate 24/7 if you are going to have a large green onsite project to serve a large demand pool if needed. The other piece that needs to happen is capital efficiency on electrolyzers needs to improve dramatically to make sure that we are at a point where that becomes cost effective. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ultimately, economics will drive those investments. And at the moment my view is, the electrolyzer technology particularly PAM isn\u2019t quite at a point where economics work out in favor of a large-scale point of inflection to green hydrogen. My view again, and I\u2019ve said this many times over so at the point of maybe delivering the point now, I\u2019ve said that that\u2019s probably a five to seven year window for electrolyzer technology to scale up, both from a technology and a capital point of view such that we get the reliability and the cost effective basis on which you\u2019ll see large-scale inflection happening. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that\u2019s kind of the one reason why we think it doesn\u2019t quite make it, and doesn\u2019t quite mean between. I do expect however we are in the interim, the five to seven years that I referenced, small and medium sized electrolyzer complexes to be built and they will largely serve what we call merchant type demand where you have a bit of flex in terms of how much product is available, how much product is provided and reliability and so on and so forth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also see development of liquid hydrogen as an important component, and again we are excited about this. We are scaling up our technology around liquid hydrogen to make sure that it\u2019s there to support the small to medium-scale green hydrogen development that we think what happen in this interim period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tony Jones</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. That\u2019s really helpful. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Begleiter </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning and thank you. Thank you for Matt. Your return on capital are very, very strong, mid 20s. And in contrast \u2013 flat to less I think five quarters. Is there an option to expect some low return but so value creating opportunities to drive top-line growth going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">David, I am going to let Matt answer this as this is one of his favorite topics. We have a lot of discussion around this. I just mentioned very briefly as a headline, we always look at our investments on an IRR basis to make sure that we don\u2019t kind of get caught up in the ROC element, but, hey Matt when do you discovered that up?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt White </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Thanks, Sanjiv. And exactly, to start off, IRR is the primary criteria for incremental investment decisions and ROC, as you know is the \u2013 basically the accounting metric on the back end. And when you think about where ROC has been and as Sanjiv mentioned in the prepared remarks, we believe that maintaining an industry-leading and healthy ROC and operating margin while growing EPS, while growing OCF is the best combination for shareholder value creation and ultimately, relative TSR outperformance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, while they are of course at theoretical limits, 25% we think is a healthy number. Obviously, the pricing has helped the non-capital intensity of our growth has helped. We are embarking on a more capital-intensive growth as we look out on some of the energy transformation and we see that as good growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It meets our investment criteria. So therefore, I would see the ROC number, yes, plateauing now as it is, maybe even declining a little bit. But we view that okay as long as we continue to make the right decisions on IRR which we feel very confident about. So for us, it\u2019s more about maintaining healthy levels and maintaining leading levels while growing the organization. But we are not going to let those metrics as either operating margin or ROC inhibit our decisions for good growth projects, they never will. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Begleiter </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, this is [Indiscernible] for Vincent. So I think your consumer gas backlog was up a little bit over 10% versus last quarter and just kind of comparing versus the slide deck it looks like the manufacturing share of that backlog is the highest it\u2019s been in sometime. So, maybe can you just talk a little bit about how you see the backlog trending over the next few quarters? And how that will kind of be spread out over the various end-markets? Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Vince. So, consumer gas backlog is today driven by a couple of factors, right? We kind of split that into a traditional onsite which is what you are referencing as an example for manufacturing metals, chemicals, energy, et cetera and then the decarbonization portion of our backlog, which is growing and my expectation is that that will continue to grow as we move forward. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we are seeing some overlap in that. So there are chemical companies obviously who are looking at decarbonization. We are developing a number of projects alongside with them and we will see that play into the backlog and of course that will kind of boost the chemical side of things. What I\u2019d say, we are winning a \u2013 more than our fair share of projects at the moment in countries like India, which are more traditional end of the market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s where you are seeing the manufacturing, metals, chemicals growth and refining growth actually pick up a little bit more. We are obviously seeing the decarbonization projects around both chemicals as I referenced earlier, but also some developments around metals which might follow in due course, as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, that\u2019s kind of what you should expect to see in terms of momentum and that momentum will translate into projects that are currently in the pipeline, getting signed up in the next few years as I\u2019ve mentioned. About $8 billion to $10 billion of that and then translating into the backlogs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from [Indiscernible] Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. And sorry if my question has already been asked and my line dropped a few times. I am just wondering one quick one on CapEx. What is driving your 2024 CapEx for $4.525 billion? Is it guarantees related to the recent award you announced or that this indicate an acceleration of growth for 2025 and 2026? Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Matt, do you want to talk to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt White </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So, as I mentioned earlier, a lot of the energy transformation we are seeing a little more capital-intensity. So ROCI project for one, which is our largest project that we have won. We are in the early stages about ordering equipment. That will drive the CapEx. We are also on the final projects that will be coming onstream into the back end of this year, into next year. So that\u2019s also driving a higher component. But when you think about our CapEx in general and break it down, we tend to have about $2 billion plus towards what we call our base CapEx, which is a little over a half is for growth projects. But growth projects that do not meet our disciplined backlog definition. And the remainder, in this case would be roughly another two plus billion will be for our project backlogs. So that is contractually committed. It has defined returns and it has contract terms to ensure we get our return like things they have certain FX fees. So therefore, the higher CapEx, we feel quite good about. We feel good about our execution that we are undertaking. And so it\u2019s really just a function of the wins we had causing that increase. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Josh Spector with UBS. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Spector</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, hi, good morning. I had a question around EMEA. So, margins were down sequentially, but sales were roughly flat and when you talk about the variant, you talk about the lower onsite volumes which I think about lower margin relative to the mix and pricing was up. So I am just curious if you could explain the driver of the margins in the quarter? And then also just your outlook for next year, margins up, flat sequentially, what you are expecting there? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Josh, as you know, EMEA hasn\u2019t seen a lot of growth. So one of the things they\u2019ve done tremendously well and I give the team credit, we are having been really one of the profit growth stories over the last three to four years despite having negative volume trends in that same period. So, they\u2019ve actually done a tremendous job of just managing that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, let\u2019s go to the fourth quarter which is what your question is and I think basically the point I think that I want to make over there is, there are some one-time costs alongside the volume decline that we\u2019ve seen over that actually impact that volume for the fourth quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My expectation is in terms of outlook, my expectation is in the first quarter we will be back with the three handle on that volume and I think my \u2013 the momentum that the EMEA team has built around managing the profit growth, my expectation would be that we\u2019ll continue to see margin improvement in 2024 as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Richardson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Sanjiv and Matt, just one of you could talk \u2013 dig in a little bit on the drivers of TSR that you talked about in the script. Clearly, the business is showing a huge amount of stability and I appreciate that the dividend has been growing at a healthy cliff year-over-year for the last couple of years. Can you just talk about, is you \u2013 if you think about the two levers there, is the buyback is it agnostic to the value of the stock? Is it \u2013 do you think about that in terms of the buyback amount like us when getting at is your dividend coverage ratio is very healthy and has continued to improve? And so, is there not a place where you could consider kind of rebasing the dividend higher just considering the stability of the business? Thanks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll just address the buyback piece in the last, Matt to kind of give you our \u2013 a more pumping of the response there, Steve. But essentially the share buyback piece we see as being an intrinsic part of our capital allocation. We think it\u2019s an important part of how we deploy and return capital back to our investors and I think it has been and continues to be a very important part of the capital allocation philosophy that we\u2019ve deployed in the business. And therefore reflected in the EPS growth targets that we\u2019ve set for us as well, which is 10 plus percent EPS growth as I said earlier. I feel pretty confident about pushing forward on that 10 plus percent EPS growth despite all the challenges around, et cetera that people talk about, because we know that we have the levers in place to make sure that we get done. Matt, do you want to cover other TSR drivers? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt White </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Yeah, and obviously both the buybacks and dividends are important. We have shareholders that value both. On the dividend, we commit to growing it every year and to your point we have very healthy ratios that enable us to continue to grow that. But one thing I will never promise is the dividend yield. Absolutely not, that makes no sense. If we do our job well every year, we grow the dividend with a healthy cliff. But we also grow the capital base of the stock. Therefore, we will never commit to a dividend yield. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the buyback side, this is because we have such excess cash in the organization and we see a very attractive opportunity to continue buying our stock back. I can tell you I\u2019ve been asked many times $180, $280, $380 on intrinsic valuation and questions like that. That\u2019s not exactly how we think about it. We look at the long term prospects just like we do any other use of capital. It\u2019s very important to understand that. We treat our capital the same whether it\u2019s for buybacks, projects because it\u2019s one homogeneous pool of capital and we have to find the best use of it for our owners. So when we look at the long term repurchases of stock, that has been a good continued use of excess capital and it also instills discipline in the organization and that if we don\u2019t meet our investment criteria on projects, we have an alternate use of capital. Because the one thing about this industry is if you invest poorly in a project, it can create problems for you for two decades. So for us, it\u2019s an important element of our overall capital allocation process and this is something we are going to continue to do. But dividend growth and buybacks are both important for our capital allocation and will continue to be. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Richardson </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks so much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Cunningham </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. I just had a follow-up on EMEA. Clearly, it\u2019s been a strong performer tightened productivity in the phase of weaker onsite volumes. I am sure on your thinking of the region longer term in the phase of potential of deindustrialization. Did you see any risk to holding these margin levels if we see continued deindustrialization and weakness going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt White</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Patrick, as I mentioned earlier on, EMEA hasn\u2019t quite been the industrial growth story other than maybe a couple of countries, broadly our growth capital is largely been deployed in Americas and APAC, which is where we saw most of the growth come through. Now having said that, EMEA has as I mentioned earlier on been a very strong profit growth story for us, we manage that whole process right through the negative volume trend. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I look ahead, I see two trends. First, a very resilient base business. Look, there was a view that if volumes in EMEA would crash two years ago when we saw the energy crisis, that didn\u2019t happen. We have seen a steady decline. We are \u2013 I am looking at the January numbers as we speak and I am seeing that flattened out a little bit. So, my expectation is the resilience of that base business which is also driven by the contract structures that we have with fixed fees and rentals and so on and so forth actually remains a very important part of that portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other piece which I think is encouraging is, we are seeing large project opportunities led largely by decarbonization. The European Union has very complex rules as you know well. But it has an intent, a very steady and stable intent to move forward with decarbonization and push industries in that direction. We see that spurring growing momentum around projects and you should expect that there will be projects that will develop and announced even from a Linde point of view in the next one, two, three years and again, that will kind of underpin the long-term trend that we see holding there. I will end off by just saying that I expect the EMEA market to continue to be an important industrial gas market for us. I don\u2019t think that will ever change. And they will have a strong contribution to mix to the EPS growth that we look at. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Patrick Cunningham </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you so much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will take our next question from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McNulty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Sanjiv, on the \u2013 you spoke on the IRA bill and kind of your views on the green hydrogen opportunity. Can you help us to think about the types of customers that you are seeing for the liquid green hydrogen? And also the types of premiums that they are willing to pay?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So, and that\u2019s a good question, John, because the distinction I want to make is I want to just talk about carbon intensity and blue hydrogen to begin with and then transition to green. So, my view is, large onsite customers recognize the benefits that come from low technical risk, established references in around blue hydrogen development. Blue hydrogen is all about using existing natural gas and converting that into hydrogen, capturing the CO2 and sequestering it to enable a low carbon intensity hydrogen to be developed and we\u2019ve given the example of Celanese that we are doing it already at an existing facility and with OCI project we will do that as we start that project up in a couple of years. So, there is an example of a large onsite customer looking for reliable \u2013 with low technology risk option in terms of something that they can then sustain over a 15, 20 year period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are \u2013 so, that\u2019s kind of the baseline against which I am now going to reference what\u2019s happening with green hydrogen. As far as green hydrogen is concerned, people are increasingly recognizing that the electrolyzer technology is fairly improved, hasn\u2019t thought the same level of reliability, cost effectiveness and I think those factors are deterring long-term off take agreements that will enable green hydrogen to \u2013 that off take agreement will enable the modernization of green hydrogen technology to be more effective longer term. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are small green hydrogen customers and that\u2019s largely built around mobility where you\u2019ll expect small volumes and you are starting to build an infrastructure and you want to have small volumes feed that infrastructure as it transitions into kind of larger broad scale infrastructure. So I think that\u2019s where you will see most of the green hydrogen. There are some small mandates that companies can impose in terms of green hydrogen being utilized in some of the chemical processes, fertilizers, et cetera. But again these are really small scale. And the last point I just want to make is that, I think people talk about gigawatts, as far as hydrogen is concerned the reality is the facility that we are setting up for OCI as an example, the facility that we set up in Sweeny for Philips 66, those are both traditional hydrogen with carbon capture sequestration producing blue hydrogen they are both a gigawatt and plus. Whereas building a gigawatt facility for electrolyzers just hasn\u2019t happened yet. You are building 20, 30, 40 megawatts which is miniscule in terms of the volume requirements that a large typical onsite customer would typically have. So, that scale is what deters the large onsite development. At the moment that scale of 20, 30 megawatts only allows for some of the developments around mobility and smaller end-users. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John McNulty</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thanks very much for the color. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Steven Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Byrne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, thank you. So in the last two years, your sale of plant and your sale of gas backlog have both roughly increased 50%. Do you expect the latter, the sale of gas to increase at maybe a faster cliff either by your preference and that you do have benefits in the rest of your business from that or from the clean energy opportunities presumably would be more in sale of gas? And then just one more \u2013 for that $8 billion to $10 billion that you highlighted as your pipeline for clean energy, how much of that would be associated with existing customers where you could either retrofit or expand the existing facilities which could generate an even higher IRR?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steve, let me going to provide the headlines first and then I will dive a little bit deeper. So the headline is, you should expect our sale of gas backlog to continue to grow and you absolutely right that the $8 billion to $10 billion that I referenced earlier on over the next few years, we will see that translate into projects that go into the backlog. That $8 billion to $10 billion is probably weighted as far as they are concerned. So, clearly, we understand that many of those projects will move forward, some may not and that\u2019s where the opportunity pipeline which is rich with 200 plus projects that I\u2019ve referenced a few times in the past is a good feeder into that $8 billion to $10 billion number that I\u2019ve talked about. So, we should really see that sale of gas backlog reflects those projects moving from an opportunity pipeline into contracts and then being reflected into the backlog number. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your question on incumbency and new projects as a default, I\u2019d say to you that that mix is a little bit opportunistic and we have made a commitment you might recall sales from our sustainability side, we said that we expect to invest about $3 billion in retrofitting and repurposing our existing asset with carbon capture facilities to ensure we capture as condition CO2 to be able to sequester it and could roll those facilities to blue hydrogen. That\u2019s where most of the retrofit will likely happen and you might recall when we said that $3 billion number, that is in the context about a pipeline we expected over a decade of $30 billion of investments in the US. So, that\u2019s a good ratio I think to just kind of if you were looking for a ratio that\u2019s the ration I would give to you as a pointing in the direction of saying that\u2019s where we think the retrofits will be, that\u2019s where the conversions are likely to happen and the new projects will obviously come alongside that, the decarbonization happening where we are helping our customers decarbonize but also new markets opening up such as blue ammonia et cetera. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Byrne</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we will take our next question from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Sison </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, cheers. Nice quarter and outlook. I am just curious when you mentioned that at the midpoint looking for a much economic growth in 2024. I get to look at your global end-market trends you have sort of for greens and yellow, so, you are sort of runrating above that midpoint and I mean, are you seeing more growth now than maybe the midpoint in terms of economic growth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt White </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, Mike, this is Matt. So a couple things, I think, first referencing that end-markets to your point. As you know, that includes the backlog price and base volume. So, all three of those will influence the growth. As Sanjiv mentioned earlier, the backlog we\u2019d expect 1% to 2% based on the cadence and that we feel very confident on given our contractual terms and conditions. Pricing, I\u2019ll hold off separately, right, that we say is based on globally weighted inflation and so whatever your assumptions are there we should be able to deliver on it. And the remaining being base volumes and that base volume is where we are taking basically an overall type assumption in this guidance, the way we are structuring it. Very similar to how we\u2019ve been approaching the last nearly 4 to 5 years. So we will see how it plays out. but right now that is the sort of underpinnings of what this zero growth assumption means and it\u2019s really around the base volumes as they correlate to an industrial production type metric. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Sison </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it.

It\u2019s [Indiscernible] on for Laurence. Thank you for taking my question. I am just wondering, you mentioned that China is relatively small part of your business but you didn\u2019t mention opportunities in India. I was wondering if you could just talk with India has more of a growth opportunity than what people usually look at which is obviously China?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, India is an important market for us. We\u2019ve been in the market for about 90 years. So well positioned. We kind of lead with strong network density all of that provides us in many ways a unique position to be able to kind of win more than our fair share of the opportunity that we see. India will be an important opportunity for our industry and for Linde in particular. But again, the scale at which China is in terms of the deployed assets on the ground, the capacities that have been built up there. It\u2019s a market that obviously will continue to be important, as well. So, we will be looking to winning more than our fair share in India which we\u2019ve been doing in \u201923 as well. And we look forward to doing that going forward. But we also continue to kind of track what happened in China and make sure that we are getting our fair share as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will now take our final question from John Roberts with Mizuho.

Slide 16 shows food and beverage up 9% year-over-year. Almost all processed food companies are showing down volume. But could you parse the volume and price in the food and beverage market? And in CO2 seeing any price impact from the 45Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Sanjiv Lamba</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The CO2 market really is what drives that food and beverage market, in particular I think the food and beverage as you can imagine has broken up into food freezing and into beverage carbonization. The CO2 pricing obviously helping and supporting that. There has been a lot of innovation done around food freezing. Linde leads the end-market in there. We won more than our fair share and again, some of that benefit comes through in the growth that we see on that line and in the sales line that you see over there for food and beverage. So, I\u2019d say to you that, again strong performance across food. My expectation is it is a secular growth trend we call it a resilient market for a reason. My expectation remains and we will see continued strong growth in that space innovation around application development and use of gases for food freezing in particular I think are continuing to be a very important part of that growth story. But beverage carbonization and CO2 pricing obviously helping as well. I think that we don\u2019t see at the moment any linkage between 45Q and CO2 pricing. Longer term, you could add pieces around that but for now, there is no apparent linkage. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Juan Pelaez for any additional or closing remarks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Juan Pelaez</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks guys for all your questions.
