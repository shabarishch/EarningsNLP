Thanks for joining us today for our earnings call to review the second quarter of fiscal year 2015. The date of this call is August 14, 2014. This call is the property of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and is intended for the use of Wal-Mart shareholders and the investment community. It should not be reproduced in any way.</p> <p>(Playback Navigation Instructions)</p> <p>This call contains statements that Wal-Mart believes are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and that are intended to enjoy the protection of the Safe Harbor for forward-looking statements provided by that Act. Please note that a cautionary statement regarding the forward-looking statements will be made following Charles Holley\u2019s remarks in this call.</p> <p>Our press release and a transcript are available on our corporate website \u2013 stock.walmart.com. Additionally, a supplemental slide deck that summarizes our key financial results should be used with this call. That presentation appears at the end of this transcript. We believe that this deck provides a more streamlined approach to reviewing our financial performance and prior year comparisons. Unit count data, which is updated monthly, is posted separately on the investors\u2019 portion of the website, under financial reporting.</p> <p>As a reminder, in Wal-Mart International, we provide results and commentary on primarily our<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> five largest markets, all of which had revenue in excess of $10 billion in fiscal 2014.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">For fiscal 2015, we utilize a 52-week comp reporting calendar, with our Q2 reporting period from May 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2014 through August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014. A week-by-week comp reporting calendar is available<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> under the comp sales link on the investor portion of our website.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For information regarding terms used in today\u2019s release, including EPS, constant currency, gross profit and gross profit rate also refer to our website. Throughout the discussion of our e-commerce performance, we are referring to our results on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned last quarter, the net gain from the sale of our Vips restaurant business in Mexico has been recorded in this second quarter\u2019s discontinued operations. Note that certain reclassifications have been made to Q2\u2019s results. Due to the results from discontinued operations, EPS for Q2 last year is now $1.23, not the $1.24 presented in last year\u2019s release. These reclassifications did not impact consolidated net income. There will be no EPS impact for Q3 and Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please mark your calendar for our annual meeting for the investment community, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the meeting. We will kick off with dinner with management the evening of Tuesday, October 14 in Northwest Arkansas. The meeting will run through approximately 3 p.m. Central Time on Wednesday, October 15. So, now let\u2019s get down to our agenda for today\u2019s call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Doug McMillon, President and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., will cover our key results and provide an overall assessment of our business. Claire Babineaux-Fontenot, EVP and Treasurer, will cover the financial details for the quarter. Then, we\u2019ll cover our results. Greg Foran, who took over this week as President and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., will kick things off. He\u2019ll be followed by Dave Cheesewright, President and CEO of Wal-Mart International, who\u2019s traveling and calling in for today\u2019s call. And, Roz Brewer, President and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club. Neil Ashe, President and CEO of Global eCommerce, will update you on the progress we\u2019ve made on our e-commerce businesses around the world. And, Charles Holley, Wal-Mart\u2019s CFO, will wrap up with a focus on our guidance for the full year and the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019m pleased to introduce our CEO, Doug McMillon, to kick off our call. Doug?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Doug McMillon</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased that Wal-Mart delivered solid earnings per share of $1.21, well within our guidance range, and that our consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion over last year to $119.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I look at our second quarter results in the context of our overall strategy, we\u2019re encouraged by the performance of our small format stores and e-commerce, areas where we\u2019re investing significantly this year. But, we wanted to see stronger comps overall in Wal-Mart U.S. and Sam\u2019s Club. Stronger sales in the U.S. businesses would\u2019ve helped our profit performance in the quarter. We can get better operationally and we will.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In an environment where customers have so many choices about where to shop and how to buy, and many of them are feeling pressure on their budgets, we have to be at our best. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to deliver a compelling customer proposition of low prices and quality service for every transaction. For many years, we\u2019ve stressed that we run this business one store at a time, and that\u2019s still true today. So, we\u2019re investing in our stores during the rest of this year to deliver positive comp sales through operational excellence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me review the second quarter results. Wal-Mart International turned in a very solid performance, with operating income up over 9% on a constant currency basis. I\u2019m pleased with the work that Dave and his team have done to manage expenses, improve profitability and drive sales. On a constant currency basis, net sales rose more than 5%, and comp sales were positive in all but one international market. I\u2019m especially encouraged by the healthy sales improvements in some of our largest markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our Wal-Mart U.S. business added approximately $1.9 billion in net sales and delivered a flat comp. I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019re gaining traction on our goal to have a positive comp by year end, but I\u2019m not satisfied. Customers are responding to Neighborhood Markets, which delivered approximately 5.6% comps in the quarter. Operating income was pressured by investments in additional associate hours and by higher healthcare costs. We\u2019ll keep working during the back half of this year to get the combination of price investments and store associate hours right to deliver improved comp sales and serve our customers in a way that exceeds their expectations here in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Last month, we named Greg Foran the new CEO of Wal-Mart U.S. I\u2019ve worked closely with Greg for the past few years, and his depth of retail knowledge will serve our customers and associates well. As our company evolves, we\u2019re focused on delivering a customer-driven retail offering that drives sales. Greg is the best person to execute this strategy in the U.S., and I am thrilled to have him leading this effort. I also want to thank Bill for his years of service to Wal-Mart. His passion for our mission, dedication to our associates and our customers, and innovative thinking pushed us forward. From his vision of lowering the cost of prescription drugs to the progress we\u2019ve made with our small formats, Bill had a meaningful impact on our company for which we are grateful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sam\u2019s Club delivered a flat comp this quarter, with net sales lower than expected. Operating income was lower than last year, due to the anticipated investment in Plus member Cash Rewards. I\u2019m encouraged by the solid growth in membership income this quarter, but I\u2019d like to see a positive comp. During a recent visit to a Sam\u2019s Club in Omaha, Nebraska, it was great to see associates energized about the club\u2019s back-to-college merchandise. They were eager to show the treasure hunt of on-trend color in home and apparel. They also helped members find the electronics and small appliances to accessorize a student\u2019s apartment. We\u2019re taking the right steps at Sam\u2019s Club to improve sales, with new merchandise offerings and localized assortment. We expect that our investment in new membership enhancements, such as Cash Rewards, will increase the membership line. Roz will cover how these programs will impact our profit comparisons over the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019ll hear more details from Neil in a few minutes, but there are some exciting things happening in e-commerce and mobile. I\u2019m really pleased that sales continued to be robust, growing approximately 24% this quarter. We saw double-digit e-commerce growth from our four most important markets: the U.S., U.K., China and Brazil. We continue to add exceptional talent to our teams through organic hiring and small acquisitions. To improve our customers\u2019 online experience, we recently started the rollout of a global technology platform. U.S. customers will appreciate the site\u2019s streamlined search and navigation functionality that personalize the user\u2019s experience. A better checkout process is coming in the near future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a supply chain perspective, we\u2019ve started construction on another new e-commerce fulfillment center, this one in Indiana. Investments like these will allow timely and cost-effective delivery of merchandise to millions of additional customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All of these initiatives are about changing with our customer. Our enterprise strategy dictates that we move with speed and agility to serve our customers more effectively. We\u2019re pushing to save them time and money, both in store and online. Because the lines between digital and physical retail have blurred, we must be nimble to adjust so that we can exceed customer expectations. Customers are rational. They respond to low prices, innovative products and the service they expect. So, we must run stronger stores everywhere we operate, with better merchandising, in-stock levels and quality service. I\u2019m confident that we can improve comp sales as we deliver on these priorities, and I\u2019m bullish on our core business. Supercenters are still relevant around the world and will play an important role for us for years to come. At the same time, we\u2019re broadening our smaller store base globally, and expanding our digital capabilities everywhere we operate. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to serve so many more customers and drive growth across the enterprise. I believe we\u2019re making good progress, but we\u2019ll keep pushing to evolve faster. Our customers expect this and we won\u2019t let them down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Claire for more financial details. Claire?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Claire Babineaux-Fontenot</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Doug. I\u2019ll take a few minutes today to provide commentary on the company\u2019s second quarter consolidated financial results, along with certain other items. Further details are available for your reference in the presentation on slides 2, 3 and 4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, the dollar growth in consolidated net sales exceeded $3.2 billion during the quarter: that\u2019s over $3.9 billion on a constant currency basis. Next, earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.21 were well within our guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consolidated membership and other income increased 8.2% to $789 million, primarily driven by strong growth in membership income at Sam\u2019s Club.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s move on to expenses. Corporate and support expenses, which includes core corporate, global e-commerce support and global leverage services decreased 1.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Core corporate expenses decreased 6.9% during the quarter. FCPA and compliance-related costs were approximately $43 million, which represented approximately $31 million for the ongoing inquires and investigations and roughly $12 million related to our global compliance program and organizational enhancements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The growth in e-commerce support expenses was driven by our continued investment in talent, technology and fulfillment. You\u2019ll hear more from Neil about the exciting work under way in the e-commerce space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our leverage services area includes the investments we are making in technology, such as finance and HR back office capabilities and risk and compliance management, including productivity initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net interest expense decreased 2.5% over last year. A reduction in interest related to the reversal of certain tax contingencies more than offset an increase to interest expense related to higher debt balances. We continue to anticipate that our net interest expense will be higher for the full year than last fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory increased 6.2%. You\u2019ll hear more about inventory from each of our operating segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Payables as a percentage of inventory was 81%, which compares to 85.8% last year, due primarily to higher inventory balances and the timing of payments. Improving inventory leverage is important, and each of our operating segments is focused on this priority.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll close today by providing a bit of color around returns. The decrease in ROI was primarily due to a decrease in operating income, as well as our continued capital investment in store growth and e-commerce. Free cash flow increased primarily as a result of the timing of income tax payments and capital expenditures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Although the second quarter presented a few challenges, we had a number of bright spots about which we are encouraged. You heard Doug mention a few of these, and you\u2019ll hear more about them on the remainder of today\u2019s call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg. Greg?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Greg Foran</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Claire. Let me begin by saying how honored and excited I am to lead the Wal-Mart U.S. business. I\u2019ve learned a great deal in 35 years as a retailer and look forward to learning more about the U.S. market and from our leadership team, our customers, and our 1.2 million U.S. associates. Now, let\u2019s talk results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Q2 comp sales performance came in as expected. However, our operating income results fell short of expectations, due in part to investments in wages, as well as healthcare expenses, which were above last year\u2019s levels and above our initial expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me provide some additional detail. In Q2, net sales for Wal-Mart U.S. grew $1.9 billion. For the 13-week period ended August 1st, we delivered a flat sales comp; and this was despite a SNAP-related headwind of about 70 basis points. Ticket was up 1.1%, while traffic was down 1.1%, a 30 basis point improvement over Q1. Our e-commerce business, including store-fulfilled sales, delivered double-digit sales growth and contributed approximately 30 basis points to the total Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our comp sales results reflect mixed performances across the business. While food was flat, health &amp; wellness delivered positive comps. Overall grocery was aided by price investments and continued inflation. However, deflation in consumables and industry softness in entertainment created an offsetting comp headwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, I\u2019m encouraged by our solid performance during seasonal events, especially during the Fourth of July holiday. I\u2019m also pleased with the consistent strength in Neighborhood Markets and continued market share gains. In the key category of \u2018food, consumables, &amp; OTC,\u2019 we gained 37 basis points of market share for the 13 weeks ended July 19<sup>th</sup>, according to The Nielsen Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For gross profit, we continued to invest in price, particularly in the categories of meat and health &amp; wellness. That investment, blended with sales mix, resulted in a gross margin decline of 7 basis points versus last year. From an operating expense perspective, the most notable headwind came from healthcare costs, which led to a 32 basis point decline in expense leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Healthcare costs increased approximately $180 million versus last year and were well above our initial estimates. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, the primary drivers of expense growth were increased associate enrollment and cost inflation. While enrollment was higher than anticipated, we\u2019re pleased our associates and their families continue to take advantage of our affordable healthcare opportunities. Near term, we expect continued pressure from health care and anticipate over $500 million in year-over-year expense growth for this fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, we also allocated additional associate hours to specific areas of the store, such as front end, deli, bakery, and overnight stocking to improve overall customer service. We also sustained incremental labor expenses related to major department re-lays in entertainment and sporting goods. In total, salaries and wages were up more than $200 million compared to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The combination of gross margin investment and expense deleverage resulted in an operating income decrease of 2.4% for Q2. We expect operating income to remain challenged for the balance of this fiscal year, given the increased healthcare costs and our commitment to price investment and customer service.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let me cover the performance of our formats. During the quarter, we opened 35 supercenters, including 24 new units and 11 conversions through relocation or expansion. We plan to open, relocate, or expand about 115 supercenters for the fiscal year. In Q2, our supercenter fleet had a comp decline of approximately 30 basis points. We recognize the need to improve the performance and standards of this format to meet customers\u2019 expectations, and I\u2019ll discuss more about our strategic priorities in my closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Neighborhood Markets continued to perform well and delivered an approximate 5.6% sales comp for the 13-week period. Sales were particularly strong in pharmacy, produce, meat, and adult beverages. Comp store traffic grew 4.1%. During Q2, we opened 22 Neighborhood Markets and remain on track to deliver 180 to 200 new units for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, we continue to learn from our Wal-Mart Express format test and have seen continued solid comp sales performance. We\u2019ll continue to roll out this phase of our test, with approximately 90 stores expected to open this fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a reminder, the majority of Neighborhood Market and Wal-Mart Express units are planned to open in late Q4. We expect this will create operating income headwinds from pre-opening expenses. We also expect higher inventory balances for the back half of the year related to these openings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Across our network, inventory was up 5% at the end of Q2. Over half the increase was attributed to new store growth, while the remainder was due in part to inflation and carrying incremental inventory from recent department re-lays and modular updates. Better inventory management will be a key focus point of mine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll review the performance of our merchandise areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In grocery, overall inflation accelerated around 60 basis points from Q1 to approximately 1.8% in Q2. Food delivered a relatively flat comp, driven by price investments in targeted categories and regions, solid performance during key seasonal events, and inflation, which was particularly strong in deli, dairy, produce, meat and seafood. However, we continued to face SNAP-related headwinds of approximately 1.6% to food, which we will cycle in November. Looking ahead, we\u2019re continuing to adapt to changing customer needs and will launch our opening price point private label, Price First, nationwide in late Q3. With regards to the consumables business, modest deflation and industry softness led to a low single-digit negative sales comp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Health &amp; wellness maintained its strong performance from the first quarter, improving comp sales growth approximately 1.8% from Q1. Pharmacy prescriptions delivered a high single-digit positive comp, due to strong script count growth and double-digit% inflation in branded drugs. Script count growth was fueled by new contracts in Medicare and expanded Medicaid coverage. Over-the-counter merchandise also performed well, reporting a low single-digit positive comp driven by a sustained allergy season. With respect to health services, we opened 4 health clinics as part of a new test concept. These innovative primary care clinics offer customers affordable healthcare services, including $4 basic checkups for our associates. We expect to have about a dozen clinics open by the end of the fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our general merchandise business remains impacted by persistent industry softness, particularly in entertainment, where we had an overall double-digit negative sales comp across online and stores. The team is working to mitigate these headwinds. They recently introduced a used video game offering that complements our existing trade-in program. We also re-laid the entertainment department, placing more focus on growth categories and product innovation. In the short term, the significant scope of the re-lay created a temporary business interruption that impacted Q2 results. However, we\u2019re confident this investment is right for the customer and will benefit sales in the back half of this fiscal year. In wireless, we\u2019ve experienced recent comp declines due to a lack of innovation in phone technology and our delay in system upgrades needed to process new carrier installment plans. We\u2019re working diligently to resolve this matter. Our re-lay and wireless impacts overshadowed several favorable results in Q2, including TV comp sales, which were up low single-digits, and VUDU, which was up double digits. Also, toys delivered a low single-digit positive comp due to strength in movie-based merchandise and sports play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In hardlines, we reported a low single-digit negative comp. While our online business continued to deliver strong double-digit sales growth, our retail stores\u2019 comp sales were down due largely to lapping last year\u2019s strong sporting goods performance. With respect to back-to-school, we\u2019re pleased with our early performance and the response to our in-store teacher appreciation promotion. This program provided a 10% discount on school supplies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our softlines business, I\u2019m encouraged by the overall performance of national brands and the growth of our softlines e-commerce business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Apparel delivered a low single-digit positive comp. This was driven by national brands and new offerings that are resonating with our customer. For example, national brands, such as Russell Athletic and Avia, drove strong performance in active wear. In addition, customers responded positively to new items and improved value in our ladies assortment. Shoes benefitted from broad assortment, including items at strong rollback prices in seasonal categories and national brands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our home business had a relatively flat comp driven by strength in e-commerce and national brands such as Farberware, Shark, and Keurig. This was offset by outdoor living, where we lapped a high single-digit positive comp from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From an e-commerce perspective, we\u2019re continuing to expand our dotcom fulfillment network and recently announced plans for our third fully dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center. This e-DC will open early in 2015 and be located near Indianapolis. Additionally, last week, we rolled out Savings Catcher nationwide, which leverages our data analytics capabilities to automatically match competitors\u2019 ads and strengthen customers\u2019 confidence that they are receiving the lowest advertised price on like items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me shift gears for a minute and discuss our U.S. manufacturing initiative. Bill took me through the terrific work accomplished thus far. I\u2019m excited about the project and remain dedicated to our 10-year, $250 billion commitment. On July 8th, we hosted a Made in the USA open call, facilitating over 800 meetings with more than 500 suppliers. Suppliers heard from senior leadership and participated in an education series related to doing business with Wal-Mart. The results of the event were outstanding, with over two-thirds of our supplier meetings resulting in an immediate decision to purchase products, or to consider them for future buys. Later today, I\u2019ll be meeting with even more suppliers in Denver following our Wal-Mart U.S. holiday meeting to build on the work so many people have already done in our Made in the USA program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now as we end the Wal-Mart U.S. portion of the call, I would like to speak briefly about my assessment of the business and priorities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wal-Mart U.S. is a great business, with a deep and rich heritage in serving our customers with a smile, in clean, tidy, well-merchandised stores, with terrific low prices and value. A cornerstone of our success has been our wonderful associates, from our stores to our DCs, our Home Office and e-commerce facilities. They still are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the core are the Wal-Mart stores, and my initial efforts will focus on the core. We will deliver against these key customer requirements: being in stock, clean stores, the right price, the right items, improved service, better productivity. I will be out in stores hearing directly from our customers and our associates and tracking our performance. I\u2019m a competitive person, so I will be visiting the market place as well. We will look to build momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Concurrently, we must return to growth. In the early years, a good portion of the growth will come from the current core. However, the market place is changing and we will change with it. We have substantial capabilities and assets that position us for future opportunities in the e-commerce market and in new formats. We have been experimenting for years in both the U.S. and in International. I am confident that with a disciplined approach, we will capture more than our fair share of this opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While it\u2019s early in the quarter, I\u2019m encouraged by a strong start to Q3. However, we know we\u2019re in a challenging retail environment, and it will take some work to continue moving in the right direction. Given that, we expect comp sales to be relatively flat for the 13-week period from August 2 through October 31, 2014.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Dave for the International update. Dave?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cheesewright</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Greg. We appreciate all of the contributions you have made to our International businesses, and we are confident the Wal-Mart U.S. segment is in great hands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Every day, our associates continue to execute our key strategic initiatives. I\u2019m pleased to say that in the second quarter we delivered solid sales and profit growth, gaining market share in the majority of our markets. As I visit the markets, I see that customers are busier and changing more rapidly than ever before. Busy customers are telling us how they want to shop, and that they want us to do two things: save them time and save them money. They\u2019re looking for faster and, more importantly, convenient ways to shop. I\u2019m encouraged by our progress in driving innovation and accelerating growth in e-commerce to improve our offering and add convenience for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The global economy remains challenged, which means the customer is also stretched. Price remains a critical factor in our customer\u2019s buying decisions. As an example, during a recent visit to Chile, I saw first-hand how important price is to our customers. Just a year ago, Wal-Mart Chile rolled out a mobile app, which allows customers to compare prices between Wal-Mart and competitors. We had almost 200,000 item scans in this quarter alone. We believe innovations like this and price position will continue to set us apart in the market place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We remain focused on price investment across all our markets and expect to continue driving improved comp performance. I\u2019m pleased with the trends in many of our markets, driven by a continued focus on being the lowest cost operator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In all countries except Brazil and China, our discussion of results is inclusive of e-commerce. Slides 7 and 8 of the presentation summarize financial details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the second quarter, we grew operating income at a rate faster than sales on both a constant currency and reported basis. We are pleased that we\u2019ve grown operating income faster than sales for the full first half of the fiscal year. These results include the charge for certain non-income tax matters of $52 million disclosed in the second quarter of last year. Even excluding this charge, operating income grew faster than sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net sales grew 5.3% on a constant currency basis, or 3.1% on a reported basis. Sales benefited from the Easter shift, strategic price investments, improved assortment and e-commerce growth. On a constant currency basis, operating income grew 9.3% and 8% on a reported basis, as most markets leveraged expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a relative basis, we were encouraged by our market share performance. Of our five largest countries, only China didn\u2019t deliver positive comp sales. We also saw strong sales growth in Argentina, Chile, Japan and Africa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventory grew faster than sales this quarter and remains a key focus area. While a portion of the increase is related to World Cup promotional items or initiatives to drive sales in the back half of the year, I am disappointed with our position. Each market has a specific plan in place to address inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s discuss some market specifics. As you can see in the slide, net sales, operating income and comps are presented on a constant currency basis only.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will begin with a recap of our EMEA region, where we recently promoted Shelley Broader as the first female Regional President and CEO. Shelley brings a wealth of merchandising and operations experience and has already hit the ground running in this important region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The U.K. had a solid quarter, growing both net sales and comp sales despite a challenging market backdrop. Comp sales were up 2%, excluding fuel, and 0.5% including fuel. Despite aggressive price investments from competitors, we accelerated our performance and grew share ahead of the total market in the 12 weeks to June the 22nd, according to Kantar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, The Grocer magazine designated Asda as \u201cBritain\u2019s Lowest Priced Supermarket\u201d for the seventeenth year in a row.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the quarter, operating profit declined slightly due to the lower margin mix, which was offset by strong cost control and productivity improvements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To satisfy the evolving shopping habits of customers, we introduced a more flexible management structure across all stores in June. The change places a greater emphasis on areas such as e-commerce and puts more associates on the shop floor, whilst removing historic back-office administration tasks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Strong e-commerce growth continued during the quarter, with sales up double digits. The rollout of Click &amp; Collect to additional Asda superstores and collection sites, and the extension of store hours offer greater convenience for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next to Canada. With Shelley Broader\u2019s promotion, we are pleased to announce that Dirk Van den Berghe joined us August 1st as President and CEO of Wal-Mart Canada, bringing with him more than 30 years of international business experience and expertise in food retail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the second quarter, Canada produced solid results in a very competitive environment. We were encouraged by our performance in food and consumables, driven by supercenter expansions. Canada net sales grew 2.9%. Comp sales were positive and improved over the first quarter, as Wal-Mart Canada\u2019s 20th Anniversary event in June favorably impacted results. Health and wellness sales also improved this quarter, with strong comps in OTC. Additionally, fresh offerings drove strong sales in food. We gained 50 basis points of market share in food, consumables and health and wellness combined, as reported by Nielsen for the 12 week period ended July 19. During the quarter, Wal-Mart Canada restructured its store associate management team to improve customer service and drive savings. Even with the impact of the restructuring charge, Canada leveraged expenses, continuing its strong focus on driving the productivity loop. However, operating income declined year over year due to headwinds in margin, from mix and price investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving next to Latin America, we\u2019ll begin with Walmex. The Walmex summary includes the consolidated results of Mexico and Central America on a U.S. GAAP basis. Walmex separately reported second quarter results on July the 23rd, under IFRS, so some numbers will differ from the Walmex reported numbers. The Walmex results discussed here exclude the impact of the sale of Vips, for which we recorded a $267 million gain in discontinued operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Consolidated Walmex sales grew 5.0% and operating income grew 5.7%. Mexico alone grew sales 5.4%, with a comp sales increase of 1.2%. Sales were driven by a favorable Easter calendar flip and strong growth in self-service formats. The net result of the World Cup was relatively neutral overall, with solid sales in electronics prior to the event, but softer sales during the 4 weeks of the World Cup. Mexico leveraged expenses for the quarter. However, operating income continues to be impacted by challenges at Sam\u2019s Club and grew at a slower rate than sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mexico\u2019s self-service business plus Sam\u2019s Club, grew market share by 20 basis points, according to ANTAD for the quarter ending June the 30th. This performance was driven by our self-service formats, gaining 240 basis points. It\u2019s important to note that our small formats, such as Bodega Aurrera Express, and our stand-alone pharmacies continued to deliver strong double-digit comps and outperformed their market peers on food and consumables by 12.3%. We have a solid price position, and we will continue to invest thoughtfully in price throughout the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To address challenges in Sam\u2019s Club, on May the 30th we announced organizational changes to simplify the structure and strengthen the business. Todd Harbaugh, who has more than 20 years of experience with Wal-Mart, including 11 years in the Sam\u2019s Club U.S. business, leads the club business, reporting directly to Scot Rank. The merchandising division for Sam\u2019s Club in Mexico was restructured into two areas, grocery and general merchandise, both led by seasoned executives. Our team is laying the groundwork for a more aggressive strategy to win back members and acquire new ones. We expect continued near-term challenges, but improvement in the longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our Mexico e-commerce business, we celebrated the first anniversary of the Wal-Mart.com.mx site launch. We are investing to double distribution capacity in time for the holiday season, and we\u2019ve completed online technology investments with the new mobile apps for both iOS and Android. We continue to integrate our e-commerce platform with stores to create a unique shopping experience. We added 116 kiosks for customers who feel more comfortable ordering and paying at the store. We\u2019re also accelerating the growth of our grocery home delivery business, leveraging the Superama experience to expand the offering to supercenters during the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our efforts to rejuvenate performance in Mexico delivered positive results in the self-service formats during the quarter, and we have the right plans in place to continue to improve the overall business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, let\u2019s talk about Brazil, where we remain focused on turning around the business. Second quarter net sales rose 9.1%, with comp sales growing 9.7%, driven by a positive impact from the Easter flip and strong World Cup sales. We were encouraged by the sales performance of the food and consumables businesses and saw an improvement in general merchandise sales, largely driven by the World Cup. According to Nielsen, our market share declined for the quarter ending June 30 driven in part by store closures within the last 12 months. However, we grew comp sales faster than our largest competitor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continued to invest in store integration in Brazil and converted an additional 80 stores this quarter to the new systems. Integration efforts simplify and standardize operational processes, giving better visibility to business results and reducing compliance risk. We are on track to have all stores fully integrated by the end of next year. Despite these integration costs, we leveraged expenses for the quarter, as the team is doing a great job focusing on operational productivity. Operating income was positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to Asia. Wal-Mart China\u2019s net sales grew 1.1%, although comp sales declined 1.6%. We continue to face significant headwinds from government austerity programs, as well as price deflation in some key categories. Despite the top line challenges, market share increased in the hypermarket category for the quarter ended June 30, and we maintained market share compared to all modern trade in China, according to Nielsen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">China\u2019s business transformation program continues to deliver substantial operational benefits, allowing us to invest in price and improve our competitive position. We grew operating income significantly over this quarter last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Wal-Mart China introduced a home delivery service in 383 stores, and customer feedback has been very positive. Average ticket for home delivery was significantly higher than the average store visit for the quarter. We are building a platform for sustainable growth in China, and we\u2019ve been working on innovative ways to deliver the best experience for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s talk more specifically about our e-commerce sales. We are very excited about the innovation and growth in our e-commerce businesses around the world. As I mentioned earlier, Mexico celebrated the first anniversary of Wal-Mart.com.mx in June. Traffic grew to nearly triple last year\u2019s volume, positioning Wal-Mart.com as one of the fastest growing e-commerce retail businesses in Mexico and the third most visited, according to comScore. In the U.K., same day grocery Click &amp; Collect is now available in most Asda superstores and 188 Click &amp; Collect sites, and total U.K. e-commerce sales were up over 20% from a year ago. Admittedly, off a low base, Canada grew e-commerce sales by triple digits, with an expanded merchandise offer and improved customer experience. Additionally, in July we launched e-commerce sales in India to supply wholesale goods to small local businesses. The initial read in India was good, and we launched ahead of our competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yihaodian, our e-commerce platform in China, grew traffic again this quarter by triple digits, and ticket growth remains strong. Net sales grew double digits. Strong sales growth in wireless and appliances drove favorable results in the quarter. In Brazil, we again saw double digit e-commerce sales growth, with very strong growth in wireless and games.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the first half results. Despite continued economic challenges and a stretched consumer, we remain well positioned in our markets for the back half of the year. We continue to be optimistic about the future and our teams around the world remain focused on our key initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I\u2019ll turn it over to Roz for the update on Sam\u2019s. Roz?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rosalind Brewer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Dave. Performance at Sam\u2019s Club improved this quarter, with approximately 50 basis points of comp acceleration versus Q1. Our business is foundationally solid and over the past year, we\u2019ve been transforming Sam\u2019s Club, with new membership enhancements, elevated merchandise, increased multichannel access, and a heightened use of data and analytics. There is still work to do, but we remain confident that these efforts will serve as a catalyst for our business, increasing the long-term value of being a member.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our top priority at Sam\u2019s Club remains growth \u2013 growing our member base and growing sales. While our top line sales growth of 1.7%, without fuel, was modest, membership income grew 11.9% in the second quarter, with Plus member renewals a primary driver. This growth is more impressive considering we have now lapped the fee increase initiated last year in May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re taking steps to increase the value of membership. This includes our investment in two new membership enhancements, Plus member Cash Rewards and Sam\u2019s Club cash-back MasterCard, both launched a little over a month ago. This new MasterCard comes with chip-enabled technology, making the card more difficult to duplicate and providing additional security from fraudulent activity for our members.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s still early days, but member response has been positive. But, what I\u2019m most proud of is how the associates have rallied behind these programs by building relationships with members and communicating the combined value of both programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Doug indicated, these investments help lay the groundwork for future comp sales growth; however, they also pose an operating profit headwind over the next 12 months. The impact of recent investments, such as Plus member Cash Rewards, can be seen in our financial results, reducing both our gross profit rate and operating income. Further, we expect that this headwind may accelerate in the coming quarters as our Plus penetration grows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, a few thoughts on our performance during the second quarter. When we spoke last, I shared that Q1 got off to a slow start, as members were hindered by poor weather, and our clubs were impacted by higher utility costs. Our lower income Savings members were most impacted, and traffic slowed across the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Q2, however, Savings member traffic improved, progressing towards more historical levels of low single-digit positives. Their growth helped support the 50 basis point comp improvement that I mentioned earlier. The Business member remains pressured, delivering negative comp growth this quarter. Overall, comp traffic growth of 0.3% was offset by a comp ticket decline of 0.3%, netting out to a flat comp for the 13-week period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, let me walk you through the financial results, excluding fuel. For results with fuel, please reference the supplemental presentation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net sales grew 1.7% to $13.0 billion. Operating income declined this quarter by 10.2% to $466 million, due to a decrease in gross profit rate and an increase in operating expenses. Operating income, with fuel, declined 4.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our gross profit rate declined 50 basis points this quarter, with 23 basis points of the decline attributable to our investment in Cash Rewards. We planned and prepared for this cost; however, the additional rate pressures from mix and price investments intensified the decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating expenses grew faster than sales this quarter by 18 basis points. Several factors contributed to our inability to leverage, including higher healthcare benefits costs versus last year and increased real estate expenses associated with opening 5 new clubs this quarter, versus 1 new club during this time a year ago. Membership and other income grew 10.5%, driven by upgrades and Plus renewals. Late in the quarter, we launched a social media initiative to drive new membership growth. We had almost 130,000 people respond to the offer, which ran from July 21 to August 1. While the majority of the offer redemptions will cross into the third quarter, we have been pleased by the number of new members who have already come into the club to officially activate their memberships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventory management remains a priority for us, with inventory increasing 4.7% this quarter. Builds for new clubs and an earlier set for fall seasonal merchandise contributed to the growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now on to our merchandising results. Our buyers have been working hard to elevate our merchandise assortment, procuring new items at incredible values for our members. We\u2019ve seen good results in areas of the business where we have introduced these new items, such as \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d snacks and apparel. Some of our core categories like tobacco, wireless, and candy, however, remain pressured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fresh / freezer / cooler delivered a positive low single-digit comp, led by solid performance in dairy, fresh meat, and cooler areas. A competitive pricing position and successful 4th of July holiday weekend boosted our fresh meat comp, as members responded to our high-quality assortment of steak, ground beef, and chicken. We continue to see inflation in dairy; however, unit growth was minimally impacted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Grocery and beverage posted a negative low single-digit comp. The snacks category continues to perform well, driven by \u201chealthy-for-you\u201d indulgences within nuts, trail mixes, chips and popcorn. We are pleased with our recent efforts to assort clubs based on member preferences within wine and spirits, representing over 100 basis point improvement in comp performance over the prior quarter. The growth was tempered by declines in candy and beverages, which were hindered by the deceleration in Business member traffic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ancillary, which includes tobacco, declined low single-digits. Tobacco comp sales decelerated, despite a May price increase, with units down mid-single digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Health and wellness delivered a positive low single-digit comp. The overall category was lifted by the high single-digit comp in pharmacy, as investments in member value and awareness over the past several quarters continue to drive growth. Within optical, an increased focus on opportunistic buys resulted in a strong assortment of new \u201cfashion sun wear\u201d items \u2013 all at a great value for our members. Over-the-counter is a focus area, as we continue to lap extremely strong prior year performance in diet and nutrition items. We have recently introduced several new items in OTC, including new nutrition bars for our health-conscious members, and initial results are promising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some of the consumable categories, such as pets and laundry, struggled this quarter, as we continue the transition to newness. This transition period resulted in a negative low single-digit consumables comp. However, our long-term focus on higher quality, better pack-size value and newness continues to accelerate results in the disposable tabletop and paper goods categories, leading to double-digit share gains over the 52-weeks ended July 19, as measured by The Nielsen Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While still a negative high single-digit comp overall, we are beginning to see comp improvement within our technology and entertainment subcategories. Our merchants have been surrounding core items, like TVs, with new and exciting tech items, and the results are beginning to show. For example, we\u2019ve added new SKUs within the portable audio category, which had a positive effect on the quarter. We\u2019ve seen comp declines in wireless, as system upgrade delays have affected our ability to provide new carrier installment plans. Home, apparel, and hardlines reported a positive mid-single-digit comp this quarter, led by a strong double-digit comp in kitchen electrics and a high single-digit comp in mattresses. You may recall that mattresses struggled last quarter, underperforming in areas of the country most impacted by weather. Our merchants worked hard to change their approach this quarter, adding a new king size SKU to our assortment with a strong price-point. Member response was clearly positive! Apparel and jewelry continued their exceptionally strong track record \u2013 delivering their fifth straight quarter of positive comps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Samsclub.com delivered another solid quarter, contributing approximately 30 basis points to the total segment comp. Double-digit sales growth was seen in both direct-to-home and Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull formats, and conversion rates improved across all access points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This quarter, we re-launched all four mobile platforms, providing easier access and simplified shopping for our members. This includes a completely new iPhone app launched in June, with features that allow Plus members to check their Cash Rewards balance on-the-go. Based on member insights, the mobile team is now releasing new enhancements and updates every 4-6 weeks to ensure the best possible experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Speaking of experience, our operations team recently launched a new in-club initiative to provide \u201clegendary member service.\u201d At Sam\u2019s Club, our members have a higher expectation of service because they pay to shop our clubs. The \u201clegendary member service\u201d concept is simple \u2013 we want to ensure that our members are engaged and have a memorable shopping experience with us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to be optimistic about the future of Sam\u2019s Club, knowing that we have laid the groundwork for success. We expect comp sales to be slightly positive for the 13-week period ending October 31. This compares to a 1.1% comp increase last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just one week ago, we hosted our annual holiday meeting with our field management teams here in Bentonville, Arkansas. Let me tell you, the teams left feeling energized and ready to serve our members. At every level of the organization, we\u2019re laser-focused on 3 key priorities: continued elevation of our merchandise assortment, growing our member base, and strengthening e-commerce, which includes mobile. We\u2019re building momentum at Sam\u2019s Club and remain confident in our ability to deliver positive comp sales during the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now pass it over to Neil. Neil?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Neil Ashe</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Roz. Our e-commerce businesses made significant progress on our strategies and delivered a number of customer-focused enhancements in our core markets. Globally, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% in the second quarter. I\u2019m excited about the capabilities we\u2019ve delivered and how we are integrating the digital and physical worlds to offer customers easier and more convenient ways to shop. We\u2019re working closely with the operating segments around the world to make all of this happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at Wal-Mart U.S., we saw double-digit sales growth, and we continued to outpace the e-commerce market overall. The major highlight was that we started to roll out a new Wal-Mart.com site experience. To the consumer, it\u2019s simpler, it\u2019s faster and it\u2019s easier shopping experience. But, it also represents a major technical feat that involves a top-to-bottom rebuild of our entire global technology platform. I\u2019m also really excited about the rollout of Savings Catcher. It\u2019s a perfect demonstration of how we are integrating digital and physical experiences to do the work for our customers, and it reinforces their trust in Wal-Mart\u2019s low prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Sam\u2019s team is moving aggressively on enhancing the digital and physical experience for members. The new iPad app is getting rave reviews from the members, going from 3.7 stars to 4.5 stars in the app store. We\u2019re also seeing great momentum in the office category and with the Click \u2018n\u2019 Pull program that allows members to order online and pick up in a club.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We had double-digit sales growth in Brazil, in Mexico and Chile, and triple-digit growth in Canada and Argentina. Of course, we saw a lot of TV sales leading up to the World Cup, but the pleasant surprise was the sales lift in games as a result of good demand for consoles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In China, Yihaodian delivered high double-digit growth rates in sales for the quarter, and its focus continues to be on the quality of the customer experience. To support these efforts, we completed 40 projects in the quarter, including Customized Message Services for customer support. And, our customer satisfaction reached a new high of 97.7%. Yihaodian\u2019s marketplace business 1Mall also more than doubled.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition to the successes in each market, we\u2019re seeing great progress on building out a world-class e-commerce organization and delivering on our strategic initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the talent side, we continued to strengthen our Global eCommerce leadership team. Fernando Madeira, who was our President of Latin America eCommerce, became President and Chief Executive Officer of Wal-Mart.com, with responsibility for the U.S., Latin America and further growth of Wal-Mart.com.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also created a new Chief Operating Officer role for Global eCommerce and are thrilled that Michael Bender, formerly president of the West for Wal-Mart U.S., is now in this role. He will drive operational excellence as we scale our e-commerce businesses and will oversee the expansion of our next-generation fulfillment networks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With these additions and others, I feel great about the depth and breadth of experience at the leadership level, as well as throughout our organization. We\u2019ve continued to have great success in hiring some of the best technologists in Silicon Valley and around the world. And, we supplemented our hiring with small, targeted acquisitions, including Adchemy, Stylr and Luvocracy this past quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our talent density is helping us deliver best-in-class technology. We\u2019ve talked about our global technology platform and how it is a top-to-bottom rebuild of everything that powers our e-commerce sites and businesses around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve been delivering a lot of elements of the tech platform this year, but most of those have been technology that customers don\u2019t see, sitting under the hood. What they will now start to see is a new site experience for Wal-Mart.com in the U.S. We previewed the site at a mom blogger day at our Sunnyvale office, and they loved it. One of them, Leticia, was saying how visually appealing the site looked and how much easier it was to find products. Input from customers helped us design the site and will help us continue to make it even better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The tech platform gives us much greater speed and flexibility. Changes to the site can be made in minutes versus days, so we can innovate, test, iterate and deploy new capabilities in real time. The site has much more personalization, and each customer\u2019s experience is always changing with fresh content that helps them discover new items. We\u2019ve built our own personalization engine to customize the experience. Customers now receive relevant options and recommendations, while they are on the site, and via email and text messages. And, given that more 30 than half of traffic to Wal-Mart.com is coming from mobile devices, we designed the site to adapt to any size device, particularly tablets. In addition to the new global technology platform, we\u2019ve been focused on building our next-generation fulfillment networks around the world to deliver orders faster and more efficiently. We have a new large-scale fulfillment center under construction in Indiana, which will complement those we\u2019ve opened in Texas and Pennsylvania in the past 12 months. We also enabled 20 more stores to fulfill online orders during the quarter, and 20% of units ordered on Wal-Mart.com are now shipped from stores. Our algorithms are helping to determine the optimal shipping point, whether from an online fulfillment center, a store DC or a store. And, in Brazil, we opened a new fulfillment center in Cajamar that is now fully operational. We will announce additional fulfillment centers around the world over the coming months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making on our strategic goals, and our investments are delivering for Wal-Mart\u2019s customers. We are pleased that we are growing faster than the market. And, this growth is coming during a time that we are rebuilding almost every aspect of our e-commerce businesses \u2013 building out our team, new global tech platform and next generation fulfillment networks. We expect to see fluctuations as we go through this work, and we\u2019re keeping our eye on the long-term. We started the year with a goal of 30% full-year sales growth. We\u2019re expecting that growth to be in the mid-20s. And, we expect higher growth in our third-party marketplace businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The opportunity for e-commerce is clear and we are stepping up our investment in our e-commerce businesses for the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will now turn it over to Charles for guidance. Charles?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Charles Holley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Neil. We are now half-way through this fiscal year, and while we have some challenges, we are encouraged by several aspects of our business. Let me cover those examples. During the quarter: Consolidated net sales increased more than $3.2 billion, with Wal-Mart U.S. contributing $1.9 billion of the increase. Wal-Mart International delivered a solid performance, with positive comp sales in all but one market and strong operating income. Earnings per share of $1.21 were well within our guidance. Wal-Mart U.S. comp sales for the quarter and the year were flat, an improvement over the prior year\u2019s string of negative comps. We\u2019re also pleased that traffic improved. And, e-commerce sales grew approximately 24% on a global basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The challenges that we face are reflected in our revised guidance, and I will go through those now. In addition to continuing global macro-economic challenges, there are several specific items that will continue to be headwinds for us in the back half of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, during the quarter, our U.S. healthcare costs increased $180 million versus last year and were well ahead of our initial estimates. This increase is a result of higher enrollment by our U.S. associates and families, as well as healthcare cost inflation. Enrollment does fluctuate with our hiring. As a result of this increased expense, we now anticipate the impact to be approximately $500 million for the fiscal year, which is approximately $170 million higher than our original estimate of approximately $330 million provided in February. That estimate was included in our full year earnings per share range of $5.10 to $5.45. Second, as you just heard from Neil, e-commerce is particularly important to both our customers and our company\u2019s future, and we will continue to invest in areas such as technology, talent, and fulfillment. As a result, our fiscal 2015 earnings per share now assumes $0.05 to $0.07 of incremental investment versus our prior guidance of $0.02 to $0.04. I would like to add that, although we are slightly revising our e-commerce sales growth to 25% for this year, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a tax perspective, the estimate of our full-year effective tax rate remains between 32 and 34%. For the third quarter, we expect our rate to be around 34%. While historically our rate tends to moderate toward the end of the fiscal year, it\u2019s important to remember that assessments of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits and the impact of discrete items could affect our rate. We are monitoring progress in Congress with respect to the extension of certain U.S. income tax legislation that expired at the end of calendar year 2013, which if not passed, could drive our effective tax rate towards the high end of our estimated range for the full year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we shared with you last quarter, we are investing in Sam\u2019s Club this year. We will continue to support our two new membership enhancements at Sam\u2019s with investments in the Plus member Cash Rewards and the cash-back MasterCard, which both launched in June. As Roz indicated earlier, while these investments will position the business better for the long term, they do pose an operating profit headwind over the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Taking all of these factors into account, we are forecasting earnings per share for the full year to range between $4.90 and $5.15 per share, versus our prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.45. This assumes third quarter EPS to range between $1.10 and $1.20 versus $1.14 last year. Our estimates assume that currency exchange rates remain at current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, before we wrap up today\u2019s call, I would like to address a few additional items. Returning value to our shareholders is clearly one of our financial priorities. In the second quarter, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends and repurchased approximately $307 million of our shares. Our operating results heavily influenced our share repurchase activity. As we look at the level of share repurchase for the first half and the remainder of this year, it is important to remember that we spent $1.5 billion to acquire most of the remaining outstanding shares of our Chilean operations, and that we committed an additional $600 million to accelerate small format openings in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The change in our working capital, specifically inventory and accounts payable, negatively impacted our cash from operations. Improving our working capital performance is a priority for all of our operating segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, thank you for your continued support and interest in our company. Have a great day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This call included certain forward-looking statements.
