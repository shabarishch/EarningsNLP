Lisa?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dr. Lisa Su</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our business continued to accelerate significantly in the first quarter, driven by the best product portfolio in our history, strong execution and robust market demand. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of double-digit percentage year-over-year revenue growth and record quarterly revenue and profitability. First quarter revenue increased 93% year-over-year to $3.45 billion with growth in all of our businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment. First quarter revenue increased 46% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, led by growth in both Ryzen and Radeon processor sales. In client computing, revenue grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year and increased sequentially as we set records for client processor revenue and ASP. Against the backdrop of strong overall PC demand, our revenue is growing significantly faster than the market, particularly in the ultrathin, gaming and commercial segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share in the quarter. Our revenue share has doubled over the last two years as we have expanded in the premium products. In notebooks, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of record mobile processor revenue, based on sustained demand for Ryzen 4000 series processors and the launch of our new Ryzen 5000 series processors. Ryzen Mobile 5000 series processor revenue has ramped twice as fast as the prior generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect continued growth in 2021 as the number of notebook platforms powered by our new processors is on track to increase by 50% compared to our prior generation. We\u2019re also making good progress in the commercial market as unit shipments of our Ryzen PRO processors grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We secured multiple high-volume wins across Fortune 500 aerospace, automotive, electronics and engineering companies in the quarter, and we\u2019re well-positioned for further growth as we have tripled our commercial notebook design wins with the largest OEMs this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In graphics, revenue increased by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year and sequentially, led by channel sales growth as revenue from our high-end Radeon 6000 GPUs more than doubled from the prior quarter. We introduced our Radeon 6700 XT Desktop CPU with leadership 1440p gaming performance in March, and are on track for the first notebooks featuring our leading-edge mobile RDNA 2 architecture to launch later this quarter. We expect Radeon 6000 series GPU sales to grow significantly over the coming quarters as we ramp production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Data center graphics revenue grew year-over-year and sequentially, driven largely by adoption of Instinct accelerators across cloud and HPC customers. We are making great progress on our data center GPU roadmaps and expect revenue to grow in the second-half of the year as we begin the production ramp of our next-generation AMD Instinct GPU to support multiple HPC wins, including Frontier, the first U.S. exascale supercomputer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frontier will use next-generation AMD CPUs, GPUs and software to deliver unprecedented scientific computing and AI capabilities, creating a blueprint for scientific, cloud and enterprise customers to enable exascale class computing and AI performance over the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Revenue increased 286% year-over-year to $1.35 billion, driven by strong growth in both semi-custom and EPYC processor sales. Semi-custom revenue declined by a single-digit percentage sequentially, which is better than typical seasonality. We expect semi-custom sales to remain strong throughout 2021, driven by significant demand for the latest generation, Sony and Microsoft consoles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In server, we delivered another quarter of record server processor revenue as EPYC processor sales more than doubled year-over-year and grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sales of both our second and third gen EPYC processors increased sequentially as growing adoption of our second-gen offerings was complemented by third-gen EPYC processors successfully ramping into production across multiple cloud and enterprise customers. Third-gen EPYC processors offer 25% more performance per watt compared to our previous generation, and deliver both, per-socket and per-core leadership across database, ERP, data analytics, Java, virtualization, cloud and supercomputing workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cloud demand was particularly strong in the quarter as Tier 1 providers expanded their EPYC processors deployments to power more of their internal infrastructure and introduced 11 new AMD-powered instances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect the number of AMD-powered instances to double by the end of the year to 400 as Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle and Tencent significantly expand their offerings with third-gen EPYC processors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the enterprise, Cisco, Dell, HP Enterprise, Lenovo, and Supermicro all announced plans to expand their AMD-based offerings, with more than 100 new third-gen EPYC processor powered server platforms that deliver superior performance and total cost of ownership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In HPC, we built momentum with new high-volume wins, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research, Sweden\u2019s Institute of Science as well as a unique on-prem and cloud solution for the United Kingdom\u2019s national weather modeling service that will be the world\u2019s most powerful weather and climate forecasting supercomputer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Taking a step back, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we have made in our data center business over the last several years as each new EPYC processor generation has ramped significantly faster than the previous generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have established AMD as a trusted strategic partner to the largest cloud enterprise and HPC customers, based on developing and consistently delivering a leadership multi-generation CPU roadmap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2021 marks an inflection point in terms of the scale, ecosystem support and customer adoption of our EPYC and Instinct processors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, data center product revenue more than doubled year-over-year and represented a high-teens percentage of our overall revenue. We expect data center product revenue to grow significantly as we go through the year, driven by our strong pipeline of new cloud, enterprise and HPC wins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We significantly accelerated our business in the first quarter and now see higher growth for the year, driven by increased customer adoption for our products, overall market strength and additional supply from our supply chain partners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also passed another major milestone with our pending acquisition of Xilinx in the quarter as shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction. We remain on track to close the strategic acquisition by the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, we have entered a high-performance computing mega cycle with the strongest products and the deepest customer relationships in our history. Our success is built on delivering a consistent cadence of leadership products. We are increasing our R&amp;D investments and aggressively driving our roadmaps to continue setting the pace of innovation for the industry and deliver best-in-class growth over the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to the Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance defender. Devinder?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Devinder Kumar</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">AMD had excellent execution and very strong financial performance in the first quarter. Our multi-generation product roadmap is driving significant revenue growth, and we delivered record financial results and free cash flow. Driven by this momentum, we delivered first quarter revenue of $3.45 billion, up 93% from a year ago, and up 6% from the prior quarter. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong increases in sales across all businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross margin was 46%, flat from a year ago, despite significantly higher semi-custom product revenue. Operating expenses were $830 million, compared to $584 million a year ago, as we continue to invest in our business. Operating income was $762 million, up $526 million from a year ago, driven primarily by revenue growth. Operating margin increased from 13% a year ago to 22%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Net income was $642 million, up $420 million from a year ago, excluding $15 million of Xilinx acquisition-related costs. Diluted earnings per share was $0.52 per share, compared to $0.18 per share a year ago. Current quarter results include a 15% effective tax rate compared to a 3% tax rate a year ago. We continue to anticipate a cash tax rate of approximately 3% for 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, turning to business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.1 billion, up 46% year-over-year due to the significantly higher client processor and graphics revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $485 million, or 23% of revenue compared to $262 million a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-custom segment revenue was $1.35 billion, up 286% from $348 million the prior year. The revenue increase was driven by the ramp of semi-custom product sales and very strong growth in EPYC processor revenue, which more than doubled year-over-year. EESC segment operating income was $277 million or 21% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago. The higher operating income was driven by higher revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.1 billion, up from $2.3 billion at the end of the prior quarter. Inventory was $1.7 billion. Free cash flow was $832 million in the first quarter compared to negative free cash flow of $120 million in the first quarter of 2020. Principal debt was $314 million, including a $24 million reduction in our 2026 convertible notes, which have only $2 million remaining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of 2021. Today\u2019s outlook is based on current expectation and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect revenue to be approximately $3.6 billion, plus or minus $100 million, an increase of approximately 86% year-over-year and an increase of approximately 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by growth in all businesses. The sequential increase is expected to be primarily driven by growth in data center and gaming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, for Q2 2021, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $900 million; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $130 million; and the diluted share count in the second quarter is expected to be approximately 1.23 billion shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year 2021, we now expect revenue growth of approximately 50% over 2020, driven by growth across all businesses, up from the prior guidance of approximately 37%. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 47%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 26% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 15%, and we expect the Company\u2019s cash tax rate to be approximately 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, we had an excellent start in 2021 with very strong year-over-year growth in both segments. We continue to invest in the business and drive strong financial returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ruth for the question-and-answer session. Ruth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ruth Cotter</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Devinder. And operator, if you\u2019d like to poll the audience for questions, please?</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, you\u2019re guiding -- you\u2019re increasing the full-year guidance by almost $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Could you give us some sense of what has changed in the last three months? Because your competitor was recently talking about cloud digestion, and you\u2019re raising guidance by $1.3 billion. So, I\u2019m curious what changed in the last three months. And if you could help us parse, which products or end markets are contributing to this increase, how much from servers or PC or semi-custom, or if there is any crypto impact? So, any color on what\u2019s driving this really strong guidance and increase for the year would be very helpful?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So, we are -- we started the year very strong, very pleased with the first quarter performance and what we see overall for the year. So, we are increasing our full-year guidance. We exceeded in the first quarter, we guided up in the second quarter, and then that\u2019s carrying through to the second-half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What we\u2019ve seen is the following. We came into the year with an overall strong demand picture, and that was certainly true. What we\u2019ve seen over the last 90 days is consistent strong demand, very strong visibility from our customers on what they need throughout the year. Particularly, you asked about data center. I think, we saw actually strong signals in the first quarter that it would be a strong data center year for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re on a product ramp cycle. We launched new products in PCs on the mobile side with our Ryzen 5000. We launched new products on the graphics side with Radeon 6000. And then, the launch of the third-generation Milan has actually gone very, very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in terms of what we see, we see very strong demand for our products. We see good customer ordering patterns and strong backlog. And then, we have also seen that the supply chain has been tight overall for the semiconductor industry. And we\u2019ve been working very closely with our supply chain partners. And so, we also have good visibility to additional supply as we go throughout the year. So, with all of that in place, I would say, we feel very good about how the year is shaping up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of where you see the strength overall, I would say it\u2019s strength across all businesses, but particularly the strength in data center is good, and we also see just, again, very good visibility and very close working relationships with our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You asked about crypto. We do not -- we have negligible crypto in here. So, this is really the foundational business, really the new products and just seeing the customers adopt and ramp quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, very helpful. And Lisa, for my follow-up, should we assume that now you are getting adequate supply, so you\u2019re kind of caught up from a supply perspective and supply is no longer a constraint, or is that still a constraint? And if it is, in which end market? Because you\u2019re keeping full-year gross margins steady at 47%. So, I was curious if there is any impact from supply or rising input costs that could be impacting your gross margins, which you decided to keep to kind of flat versus your last outlook? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would say, Vivek, it\u2019s still early in the year. So, the entire semiconductor supply chain is very, very tight. I think, you hear that from all of our peers in the marketplace. That being said, we\u2019ve been working very closely with our supply chain partners. We have seen improvements that have led to the improved full-year guide. We\u2019re going to continue to work on that because right now, I would say the channel -- the inventories are very low throughout the entire supply chain, whether you talk about at our customers or in the channels. And so, there\u2019s quite more that we would like to be able to do. That being the case, I think, we continue to work well with our partners and take lots of actions there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to overall costs and things like that, we are watching those things, I think, from logistics and some of the component costs and things like that. So, there\u2019s \u2013 mostly, the gross margin guidance is reflective of the fact that we do have ramping of our new products. And we also have some ramp of the gaming products, which are a little bit below corporate average. But we\u2019ll see how things progress as we go throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vivek Arya</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Lisa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Vivek.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Blayne Curtis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Thanks for taking the question and nice results. Maybe just following up on Vivek\u2019s question. I was just curious, the semi-custom business obviously is not following any sort of seasonality, but there\u2019s a lot of talk about supply constraints there as well. You basically saw no seasonality in March, and it seems like it\u2019s not growing much in June. So, just maybe just, is that still impacted by maybe not your shortages, but other shortages, and just any perspective on that business for the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So thanks, Blayne, for the question. I think, the semi-custom business, if you look at the console launches that happened last year, I mean, they were phenomenally good launches, right, very, very good products. So, you\u2019re right. Seasonality is completely different this year than sort of a typical year. We had a strong first quarter better than seasonal. We were down, but down single digits. There\u2019s a bit of growth as we go through the year, but it\u2019s just starting from such a high point in the first-half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the way I would say it is, I think there is a strong secular demand for gaming. And whether you\u2019re talking about consoles, or you\u2019re talking about PC gaming, or you\u2019re talking about the overall sort of gaming ecosystem, there\u2019s a significant demand. And so, we believe there\u2019s strong demand, and we\u2019re continuing to ramp supply to meet that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Blayne Curtis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. And then, I just want to ask you on the competitive landscape on the client side. You clearly gained a couple of points of share in March. Intel was talking about they\u2019re being more aggressive on their percent of 10-nanometer product. Maybe just talk about the competitive landscape as you look through the rest of the year? And are you seeing any change to that landscape as they ramp 10-nanometer?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, Blayne, I think, the PC business has certainly -- had a very strong second-half of last year and is strong this year. I think, within that, we feel very good about our progress, particularly in notebooks and particularly in the premium segments of notebooks. So, we had a strong record quarter for our notebook business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our ASPs were up sequentially and year-over-year. I think, we\u2019re seeing traction in sort of the premium ultrathin, gaming and commercial. We feel very good about the platforms that we have and the platforms that we have throughout the year. Ryzen 5000 is a very competitive product. I will say that there are lots -- a bit of low-end units have come into the market, but our focus on the premium segments have done very well. So overall, pleased with the PC environment and feel that we\u2019re very competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Blayne Curtis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Aaron Rakers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit about the server CPU cycle. I know, you\u2019ve talked about kind of an expanding footprint with the cloud guys. But I was curious of where we stand today, as far as more of the traditional OEMs, the progression of their systems. I think you said 100-plus systems. When do you think that those will all be shipping in the market? And how would you put the context of Milan relative to Rome on that front? And I have a follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So, Aaron, the data center business obviously is a very strategic focus for us. And with EPYC with each generation, we\u2019ve really tried to expand the reach. I think, here in the first quarter, what we saw is very strong results, doubling year-over-year. It is on the strength of cloud. But what we saw was both Rome ramping, so we saw Rome units up sequentially, and we also saw Milan ramping. And what that says, this is what we expected. We actually expected that we had a good footprint in Rome and that that would continue to be well deployed as we come into the first half of this year, and that\u2019s played out. And then, Milan is just a very, very good product. I mean, it\u2019s extremely well positioned. Not only do we have per-socket leadership, but we have per-core leadership, which again expands the footprint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in terms of your question about cloud versus enterprise, we were more cloud weighted in the first quarter as some of those instances, both internal and external, ramped. We would expect that enterprise, both enterprise as well as HPC deployments will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. But we\u2019ll see Rome and Milan in the market together all through this year, and we expect strong adoption on the enterprise side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Aaron Rakers</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And then, the other question kind of dovetailing off that is, you talked in response to a couple of different questions. You talked about visibility. Our visibility is very strong. It\u2019s improved, et cetera. So, how would you characterize your visibility today relative to, let\u2019s say, what it was three months ago? And what gives you the confidence? Has there been something that\u2019s happened as far as discussions with the cloud guys, that\u2019s given you more confidence in the visibility of the growth through the remainder of this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, Aaron, I mean we -- when we started this year, we expected to have a strong product cycle, just given everything that we saw in terms of platforms, design wins, sort of customer engagements and process. But, in the last 90 days, I think we\u2019ve seen that really firm up. So, from the standpoint of just the consistency in all of the schedules that were supposed to be met, I think customers are liking what they see. We are having multi-quarter conversations. Just given the tightness overall in the supply chain, I think everyone is wanting to be clearer and more transparent about their needs. And that\u2019s very helpful for us, frankly. That\u2019s very helpful for us in a tight environment. It gives us the ability to plan several quarters out. And so, I think that\u2019s the differences. We have strong visibility into what customers want and what we can deliver. And so, that gives us confidence that we have the right signals in place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question today is coming from Matt Ramsay from Cowen &amp; Company. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the enterprise notebook business. And I noticed you highlighted in the release and in the slides where you are in several different verticals in design wins on enterprise notebook in the Fortune 500. And I wonder if you might speak a little bit about the relationships that you\u2019re building with the big enterprise customers? Do you have FAE support, software support, firmware support, et cetera? Do you have the right people in place to really ramp that business more materially going forward? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, definitely, Matt. It\u2019s been a high focus for us to ramp our enterprise notebook business as well as the enterprise server business. And they actually share many of the same customers and IT departments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, yes, we\u2019ve made very good progress on the enterprise notebook business. I think, we have a great set of platforms with our OEM partners. We\u2019ve also ramped up our field application support and our customer engagement models for deployment. Overall, I think, we\u2019ve gotten some very nice commercial notebook design wins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, in this environment, for us, the important thing is to stay very focused on the longevity of the business that we win. And so, a lot of focus is on those commercial pipelines and how they develop, both on the notebook side as well as on the server side. And I think we\u2019ve made good progress, but we still have a lot of opportunity to grow as we go through the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Ramsay</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for that. For my follow-up, it\u2019s a bit unrelated. One of the businesses that maybe you\u2019ve not had supply or there\u2019s been other parts of the business growing much more quickly, I wanted to ask a bit about gaming. The new RDNA 2 architecture I think brings some new features, but obviously there\u2019s a strong incumbent competitor in the gaming market. Maybe you could just talk about where you are competitively right now, how you see supply coming online that might support that gaming franchise a bit better, and just maybe the lay of the land in gaming right now? Because it\u2019s one piece of the business that everything else is going so well, I think there are some opportunities there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, the consumer graphics or the gaming graphics business, as you talk about, has actually done well for us. It grew double digits this past quarter. We had a very deliberate strategy here with the launch of RDNA 2. We started at the top of the stack with our big Navi product. And then, we\u2019ve now introduced a couple of additional products. And you\u2019ll see that both from the channel, sort of adding board cards into more OEM systems and notebook business as well as additional variants. So, it\u2019s an important market segment for us. We\u2019re happy with the progress. I think, gamers really appreciate the product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s fair to say that the graphics demand is very high across the marketplace. So, we\u2019ve actually put quite a bit of product into the market, but the demand still exceeds supply. You\u2019ll see that increase as we go through the second half of the year. And overall, I think, the progress that we\u2019ve made with RDNA 2 is fantastic, and we continue to believe that gaming overall is a great secular growth story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question today is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lisa, I wanted to ask about the data center GPU business. I realize it\u2019s still a relatively small percentage of the overall business. You talked about production ramping in the second half of this year. You talked a little bit about Frontier as well. But what kind of customer pull are you seeing in your data center GPU business? And then, I got a quick follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Toshiya, thanks for the question. We\u2019re making very nice progress in the data center GPU business. It\u2019s in the investment mode now, so we\u2019re investing heavily in the business. We launched the CDNA architecture or the compute optimized architecture last year. You\u2019ll see updates to that this year as we bring out the next generation with our Frontier systems. The revenue is, albeit, on the lower side in terms of just size of the business relative to the rest of the business, but we will see growth into the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the business here is actually very strategic, right? It\u2019s the idea of really putting together heterogeneous systems and bringing our CPU technology with EPYC together with our GPU technology with Instinct with the software capabilities that we have been investing in, and really getting strong HPC systems as well as AI and machine learning capabilities. So, we will see growth in the second half this year. It will still be a smaller business, but we see it growing in this strategic time frame over the next couple of years. And it is very much that end-to-end story of what you need to really satisfy sort of the key workloads in the data center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Toshiya Hari</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And then, as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the potential threat from ARM longer term. Within x86, obviously you\u2019ve got significant runway from a market share perspective. But how are you thinking about the potential threat from ARM-based processors, both in your client business as well as your server business? You\u2019ve got Apple obviously internalizing some of their CPUs on the client side, hyperscalers talking about internal solutions. And your closest GPU competitor launched -- or introduced rather ARM-based CPU multiple years out. So any thoughts on ARM versus x86 and how you address that would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, so, absolutely. I think the key point here is you really have to have a very, very strong product roadmap, and that is really what we\u2019re focused on. I think the overarching trend that computing is becoming very important. And so, there are additional entrants trying to address different aspects of computing, I think is to be expected. And when you look at the data center in particular, I think the trend that computing is becoming more workload optimized is also an important trend. These are the things that we\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time, and we\u2019ve been looking at ensuring that we address that in our roadmap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, our focus is to continue to optimize solutions across the data center and across the PC ecosystem, make sure that what we have is very competitive, addressing what customers\u2019 needs are. And we also have the ability to customize solutions as well with our strong IP portfolio. So, all that being the case, I think the answer is very competitive market, but we feel very good about the roadmap that we have in front of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question today is coming from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Congratulations on the solid result. Lisa, maybe another way to ask that last question of x86 versus ARM. I\u2019m wondering if you could address it from the perspective of general purpose compute versus semi-custom and ASIC. Because clearly, as Moore\u2019s Law is coming up with some issues the move towards semi-custom and ASIC is much more prevalent. I know to the answer to Toshiya\u2019s question, you said that you\u2019re doing -- or you have the ability to do semi-custom. Do you actually have engagements? And how do you see sort of general purpose compute versus semi-custom ASIC playing out over time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So John, the way I would address that is I think there\u2019s a whole range of computing solutions that you need. And this is back to a few years ago, our conversations about heterogeneous compute being you need to have the right compute for the right workload. I think that\u2019s the overarching aspect of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No question that for our business, general purpose compute is the largest piece of our business and will continue to be so. We are doing -- we certainly do optimizations for specific customers today. And I think that\u2019s -- that for large cloud customers, they expect that, and we are doing that. We do have the ability to optimize on a more specific basis. And if you look at the evolution of our architecture, I think that when we do these chiplet architectures and things like that, it really allows that. So, lots of good engagements going on with customers overall, and I think the key is to be able to have the right IP building blocks. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, right, having the best CPU cores, the best GPU capability, having great interconnect, and then, with the bringing on of Xilinx, having the adaptive computing solutions there as well, gives us a lot of options to optimize solutions with customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Pitzer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And Lisa as my follow-up, you\u2019re still relatively early in this new gaming console cycle. And typically through those cycles, your products gross margins had some pretty good uplift. I\u2019m wondering if you can just help characterize where you think you are in sort of the gross margin cycles for the gaming console business. And if you want to tell us kind of how dilutive you think it is to overall margins and where that might go by the end of the year. That would be helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. John, I would say that we\u2019re still very early in the console cycle. And from -- if you think about it, we\u2019re only a couple of quarters into it. So, I think this is a big cycle, and there\u2019s a lot of momentum in the cycle. We\u2019re going to continue to work on improving costs and improving margins and things like that. But, I would say that we still have a ways to go and lots of opportunity there as we go through the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lisa, I guess, you had indicated you believe -- I believe you said you thought you gained share in the server market. My back of the envelope calculation suggests you gained at least 2 points of share in service, which is an acceleration on my estimate of about 1% share gain a quarter over the previous four quarters. So, I guess, can you tell me if my math is materially off? And if not, what is -- is this a new higher rate of share gains? And what would you chalk this up to? Are you guys at a tipping point? Are your customers at a tipping point for embracing AMD as a supplier? Do they have increased comfort, or is your ecosystem for support? Can you just maybe just give us the higher-level picture about where you think your customers are and really embracing and ramping up your server offerings at a higher rate. And I have a follow-up, if I may.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sure. So, in terms of our data center performance in the first quarter, it was quite strong. And when I look at the drivers of that, we saw cloud in particular quite strong. And when I look at the drivers underneath that, there are a couple of things that have come together. I mean, first of all, I mean we\u2019ve been very, very deeply engaged with our customers the last number of quarters in qualifying new instances, qualifying new internal workloads, really expanding the regional capability of our coverage. And so, all of those things, I think, have led to some lift overall in the data center business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, going forward, I think the other piece of it is, if you recall when we did the Naples to Rome transition, that transition was pretty much people switched from Naples to Rome. What we\u2019re seeing in this cycle is a bit different. What we\u2019re seeing is that Rome has a set of very strong coverage in terms of applications that they\u2019re in, that are ramping very nicely, that are having good demand. And then on top of that, we\u2019re adding Milan, which is just a very strong product on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think those are some of the things that are perhaps a bit different about what we\u2019re seeing right now. That being this case, things move around from quarter to quarter. So, I would say that the data center signals that we\u2019re seeing are positive. We\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s a lot of engagements with customers. And the main thing for us is as important as the current year is we\u2019re also very focused on the long-term road map. And so, we\u2019re engaging now on Zen 4 and beyond. So, it really is a multigenerational discussion with our top customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Lipacis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, a follow-up on -- just coming back to ARM, you answered the previous questions with kind of talking about embracing the idea of having heterogeneous architectures in semi-custom and working with your customers to develop solutions. If I go back, AMD had an ARM server offering before. Can you give us an update on the state of that ARM server IP? Is that something that you can resurrect, or have you been keeping it, the development, working on that? And can you discuss -- are your customers asking for your help in delivering semi-custom solutions that have an ARM component to it? Because from what I can tell, it looks like three cloud service providers have ARM server offerings in their platform, and -- but there\u2019s a lot that don\u2019t and don\u2019t have quite the development capabilities. So, I was hoping if you could just talk more specifically about the IP that you had? And are you bringing that back if your customers are asking for it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Sure, Mark. So, look, we know the ARM architecture well. Certainly, our engineers know it well. And we consider ARM a partner in many respects. We use ARM IP in various aspects of our devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of that specific custom ARM design, we don\u2019t have that in plans right now. In terms of whether we would do custom ARM designs, I think the answer is yes. That\u2019s the whole idea of the semi-custom business. And so, I think it\u2019s less about ARM versus x86 and much more about having the right IP in the right sort of combination to satisfy sort of the customer solutions. And that\u2019s the way we look at it. It\u2019s really what problem are you trying to solve? And let\u2019s look at sort of the collection of IP that we have and the capabilities that we have to help address that set of sort of issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the strong results and guide. Lisa, I wanted to ask you a little bit of a conceptual question. In your full-year guidance, you clearly raised the revenues to a very strong number, but you kept the margins the same. I think, people understand the operating margin side of it that you have an opportunity to invest and great opportunities in front of you to grow. But, on the gross margin side of things, I\u2019m just a little surprised, given the strength that you\u2019re talking about in the data center business, the HPC, Frontier, those things kicking in the back half of the year. I\u2019m a little surprised that it didn\u2019t go up. Now, you\u2019ve delivered very consistent guidance and increases improvements over time, and I can\u2019t recall the last time you missed your gross margin guidance. But, I\u2019m just wondering what the puts and takes are that would keep that gross margin guidance flat for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Ross, sure. So, let me perhaps start, and then Devinder may have a few comments. So, I think from an overall revenue standpoint, I think we are very comfortable with the guide up, just given the visibility that we have on the customer demand front and on the supply front. On the overall margins, we are guiding up sequentially as we go from Q1 to Q2. And then, I think for the second half of the year, what we would say is look, it\u2019s early in the year. And it\u2019s a very dynamic environment, Ross, I mean a very dynamic environment. And so, we\u2019re watching the puts and takes, and there\u2019s always product mix things that come into play in terms of the puts and takes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But, I think we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re in a good place. And as we go through the year, we\u2019ll give you more updates on that. But, there isn\u2019t anything more than that. I think, it\u2019s just where we are in the year. And given the dynamic environment we have in the marketplace, that\u2019s what gives us approximately the 47% guide. I don\u2019t know, Devinder, you want to add to that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The only thing I\u2019ll add, Ross, I think as you know, the situation is pretty tight, as we talked about the overall global supply situation in semiconductors. So, we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45, this quarter 46, guiding 47. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Seymore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for the detail. That\u2019s really helpful. For my follow-up, I want to be a little more tactical, but it will somewhat fold into your answer to the first question. That is for your second quarter guide from the midpoint of up roughly 4%, could you give us a little bit of puts and takes between your two main segments? And I guess, the slightly longer-term question part of that would be, data center being high teens in the first quarter was great sequential growth, doubling year-over-year. Any sort of color on how you think that percentage changes throughout the rest of the year, given your 50% growth guidance for the entirety of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Ross. So, in terms of the second quarter, as we look at sequential growth, we do see sequential growth in the data center business, so on the server side as well as on the data center graphics side as well as some growth on the gaming side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look at the full-year, our expectation is that the percentage of the company that is sort of the data center percentage of the company will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. And that\u2019s just the dynamic of some of the strength in the consumer businesses in the first half. So, that\u2019s not normal seasonality. And just the acceleration or some of the growth that we see in the data center business as we go throughout the year would lead to a higher percentage of revenue in data center on higher revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research. Your line is now line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I first had a question on data center in the quarter. So, the EESC was up almost 100 million. EPYC was up, and semi-custom was down, which means EPYC was up even more than that. Can you -- I know it was both Rome and Milan grew. But how much of the actual growth -- the 100 million plus sequentially that must have been EPYC, how much of that growth, how did that split out between Rome and Milan? Was it like the majority of the growth of that was Milan? And how do you see Milan as a percentage of a data center CPU mix in Q2?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Stacy. So, if I look at the first quarter, we shipped Milan as well in the fourth quarter, right? So, we shipped a good amount of Milan in fourth quarter, a good amount in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say, in terms of growth, it was probably more Rome weighted in the first quarter compared to Milan, but there was good growth in both. And then, as we go into the second quarter, we would still expect to see growth in both Rome and Milan, with Milan growing faster, as that ramps. And we would expect by the third quarter that it would cross over and Milan would perhaps be higher than Rome. Now, obviously, these things change a little bit as customers go through their ramps, but that\u2019s sort of what we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, the meta point is Rome demand is robust and will stay a good part of the revenue for this year in its entirety. And then, Milan is ramping quickly, and customer adoption is strong. And so, we expect it will ramp quickly as we go through the next couple of quarters. Hopefully, that answers your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That does. Thank you. I have a follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind. I actually do want to ask a question about OpEx. So, I know, the model you gave at the Analyst Day had a midpoint for OpEx revenue of 26.5%. And I know you\u2019re running ahead of revenue and everything right now. But, if I sort of back out the second half implied guidance for OpEx, it actually is at that 26.5% run rate in the second half, to get to 26% for the full-year. Should we think about -- I guess, it\u2019s like as we go into 2022, do you think you\u2019re sort of at the model OpEx run rate, that sort of like more than 26%, 26.5% on whatever the revenue is? Is that the right way to think about the OpEx trajectory going forward? And I guess, like -- do you think you\u2019re actually spending enough at this point, given where you\u2019re taking the roadmap? Are you spending at the right levels right now to ensure that, that roadmap is actually cemented and firm?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Stacy, very good question. I think we are -- the revenue is well above our long-term model. And certainly in this year, it\u2019s well above our long-term model. Last year, it was well above our long-term model. And we\u2019re taking the opportunity to invest. And from that standpoint, our investments in R&amp;D really, as you say, cementing roadmap, our investments across sales and field support and all of the customer-facing support. And frankly, we\u2019re making investments in sort of some of the infrastructure surrounding the company as well since it\u2019s just a much larger company than it was a few years ago. So, I think the answer is yes. We\u2019re investing enough. And I think we\u2019re taking the opportunity to be very aggressive with those investments to -- given the strength of the revenue growth. Maybe, Devinder, you want to add to that or...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I think that\u2019s good. I think you covered it. We\u2019ve been very disciplined, as you know, Stacy, over the years about managing the OpEx. It does scale with revenue. But, OpEx is growing lower than -- lower rate than revenue. And obviously, that shows up in the financial results from a model standpoint. The leverage, as you mentioned, the operating margin is going up for the Company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lisa, I wanted to ask also about share gains. You\u2019ve done a great job this year in both, client and in data center. At the same time as was referenced before, Intel\u2019s tone is definitely changing. They use the word leveraging relationships. And they talked about other tactics to sort of stem or arrest some of their share losses. And they\u2019re now offering x86 cores via foundry and things like that. So, I guess, the question is sort of beyond this year, because the competitive environment this year is pretty much set. So, do you think we can extrapolate the success you\u2019ve had this year into \u201822 and \u201823, or do you think the competitive environment will intensify in the next few years? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, Tim, I would say that we have always expected the competitive environment to be very strong, and we still do. So, by the way, there are lots of competitors out there. From our standpoint, I think over the past few years and the past few generations, I think we\u2019ve built a track record with customers, and we\u2019ve built a set of deep relationships. And we\u2019ve learned a ton about what\u2019s important to customers, where to spend the time, the effort, and where we need a close partnership. So, I feel very good about where we\u2019re positioned this year, but I feel very excited about what we have in the road map going forward. And I mean we\u2019re not slowing down. So, there\u2019s a lot in the roadmap. And we have more resources and more capabilities to bring to the market. And I think we\u2019re going to be very competitive going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Timothy Arcuri</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Totally, thanks. I guess, as my follow-up then, can you give just -- Devinder, maybe give some sense of what the loading is for semi-custom first half to back half? It seems like it\u2019s going to be about even back half versus front half this year. Is that correct?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Devinder Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re slightly up in the second half. Because the launch of product in the second half of last year started out strong because it\u2019s a new console generation. And then, maybe slightly up in the second half as well I would say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our final question today is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You talked a little bit about the supply constraints that you\u2019ve been dealing with. Can you talk about where those are coming from? Is that a wafer constraint, substrate constraint, both or other stuff? And where -- when you talk about making progress and kind of getting more supply out, what\u2019s the source of that progress?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Dr. Lisa Su</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So, I think, Joe, I would say overall, the demand if we look at coming into this year, the demand has been sort of higher than our expectations. And there are sort of industry-wide types of things that are going on. We work very closely with our supply chain partners. So, whether it\u2019s wafers or back-end assembly test, capacity or substrate capacity, we work it on a product line by product line level. So, I don\u2019t know that there is a single thing that I would point out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say that on a product line level what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ll continue to do is ensure that there are multiple sources for things, particularly in the back end, that gives us flexibility to move things back and forth. We continue -- on the substrate side in particular, I think, there has been underinvestment in the industry. And so, we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to invest in some substrate capacity dedicated to AMD, and that\u2019ll be something that we continue to do going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also -- I mean we also have fantastic engineering teams that are just looking at how we, together in the ecosystem, just get more productivity into the system. And we work very closely with TSMC to make sure that we\u2019re forecasting well and getting the right support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think, it\u2019s all of the above in terms of making sure that we have the capabilities. And the other thing I\u2019ll mention, Joe, is just it\u2019s not just about processors, but it\u2019s included -- it\u2019s also ensuring that they\u2019re matched sets in the ecosystem. And so, our teams are also working very closely with our OEMs to make sure that we\u2019re together ensuring that they\u2019re the full system components necessary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it is a complex supply chain environment. And I will tell you, given everything that I\u2019ve seen, it is a complex environment because all markets are so hot. But I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve been able to make progress. And by the way, we\u2019re not done, right? There\u2019s plenty more that we would like to do to get more capability in the supply environment. And so, we\u2019re working closely with our partners across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joe Moore</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Well, definitely very impressive results in the context of everything going on. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back for any further or closing comments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ruth Cotter</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you, Kevin. We would like to thank everybody for joining today\u2019s call, and we\u2019ll look forward to engaging with you throughout the quarter. Thank you, everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference webcast. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.
