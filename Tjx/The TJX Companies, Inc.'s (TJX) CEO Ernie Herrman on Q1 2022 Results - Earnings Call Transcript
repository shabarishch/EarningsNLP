And now I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ernie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Ernie Herrman</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is Scott Goldenberg. As we\u2019ve done throughout the pandemic, I\u2019d like to start our<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> call today by saying how truly grateful I am for the hard work and dedication of our global associates and their continued commitment to our health and safety protocols. I want to give special recognition to our store, distribution center and fulfillment center associates who continue to physically come into work. In recognition of their continued efforts, we awarded a vast majority of them an appreciation bonus, which was the fourth appreciation bonus that we have paid during the pandemic.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While the health crisis is beginning to improve in some parts of the world, there are many areas that are still facing challenges or have become worse. Our hearts go out to everyone whose lives have been impacted by this virus. We are hopeful that more people around the world will have access to the vaccine in the coming months and that we can move past this health crisis soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to our business operations, during the first quarter, we were very pleased that our U.S. stores were able to stay open. However, we continue to have a significant number of our stores in Europe and Canada that were temporarily closed at certain times throughout the quarter due to government mandates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Currently, approximately 300 stores remain temporarily closed, all of which are in either Canada or Europe. Around the world, we continue to prioritize the health and well being of our associates and customers and our stores, our distribution centers and our offices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I will recap our first quarter results. First, I am extremely pleased that our overall open only comp store sales when compared to fiscal 2020 increased 16%, which well exceeded our plans. We believe we saw a benefit from consumers feeling more comfortable leaving their homes, visiting our stores and being happy with the brands and values they found. Our home businesses across all of our divisions continued their phenomenal sales trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Further, we saw strong open only comp increases in many other categories and positive open only comp store sales in overall apparel. Open only comp sales were also outstanding across each of our divisions, which indicates to us that our value proposition continues to resonate in all of our geographies. I\u2019ll talk more about our divisional performance in a moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, overall sales of $10.1 billion were a first quarter sales record, despite the temporary closing of our stores for approximately 14% of the quarter. We are extremely pleased that we are seeing our most loyal customers return to our stores in the U.S. and that new shoppers are discovering our great values and exciting treasure hunt shopping experience. All of this gives us great confidence that we are set up extremely well to continue driving sales and gain additional market share over the medium- to long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Third, merchandise margin remains healthy. The buying environment is excellent with the marketplace loaded with a great selection of merchandise across good, better and best brands and trending categories. Our buyers are doing a tremendous job sourcing quality branded merchandise to keep up with the strong consumer demand that we have been seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, first quarter earnings per share of $0.44 we\u2019re also well above our plans, despite a larger than expected sales loss, as our non-U.S. stores were temporarily closed more than we had anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to our divisional performance, which is again compared to fiscal 2020, beginning with Marmaxx. Marmaxx\u2019s open only comp store sales increased an outstanding 12% and overall sales increased 14% versus the first quarter of fiscal 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Marmaxx\u2019s home business continued its excellent performance with a comp increased some of the HomeGoods as shoppers continue to spend on their homes. We were also very pleased to see a comp sales increase in our overall apparel business, which is driven by strong demand in select categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe our apparel sales benefited from wardrobe refreshing as more consumers began resuming more normal activities. We feel very good about Marmaxx\u2019s sales momentum and our ability to flex the merchandise mix to the category shoppers want.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At HomeGoods, open only comp store sales increased phenomenal 40%. During the quarter HomeGoods and Homesense sales were remarkable across all major categories and geographic regions, as their eclectic mix of home fashions from around the world continue to resonate with consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similar to Homesense sales at Marmaxx, we believe HomeGoods sales continue to benefit from consumers spending more time in their homes during the health crisis. We have been aggressively investing in the growth of our home division for many years and are convinced we are set up very well to build upon our market leadership position in the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While Canada continues to face challenges with store closures, we are very encouraged with the sales trends we have seen when our stores are open. TJX Canada\u2019s open only comp store sales increased 9%. Open only comp sales at our Homesense banner and home sales at Winners and Marshalls were also in line with the increase we saw with our HomeGoods division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shoppers love our great values in Canada and we are very confident that this division is well-positioned to return to and exceed their pre-pandemic sales levels once we are beyond this health crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, The TJX International, like Canada, Europe faced continued store closures and we expect them to continue into the second quarter as well. However, during the limited time our stores were permitted to be open. Customer excitement was very high and response for our values was fantastic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We were very pleased with TJX Internationals 11% open only comp store sales increase. Given the length of time our stores were closed in Europe, we saw significant pent-up demand when we reopen later in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As the only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of significant size in Europe, we see an opportunity to scale our business and capture a bigger piece of the European retail market over the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Australia, where our stores were generally open for the entire quarter, comp store sales were extremely strong for both our apparel and home categories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As to e-commerce overall, we saw terrific growth over first quarter fiscal 2020 sales levels in both the U.S. and U.K. We are still on track to launch homegoods.com later this year and are looking forward to offering consumers even more exciting home fashion items at great value online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on, while the health crisis persists, we are confident that the core strengths of our off-price business model will continue to help us navigate through the current environment, while setting us up very well to succeed in a more normalized environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me take a moment to highlight these strengths. First, is our relentless focus on value, we believe our value proposition, which is a combination of brand, fashion, price and quality, is as important as ever to consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, is our world-class global buying organization of more than 1,100 buyers. These buyers are located in 12 countries across four continents and sourced from a vast network of approximately 21,000 vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We see our global buying offices and reach as a tremendous advantage, particularly in an environment where travel remains limited. Consumer demand across our home businesses has been especially strong. So, our ability to successfully leverage our global buying has been a great benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe our 500 plus homebuyers around the world allow us to offer consumers a truly global differentiated merchandise mix versus other large retailers. We strengthened our relationships with many of our vendors and have added thousands of new vendors for apparel and home product over the past year. All of this allows us to offer a fresh and exciting mix of quality-branded merchandise to our shoppers every time they visit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, the flexibility of our buying, store format and distribution network allows us to take advantage of consumer trends and hot categories as consumer demand changes. We also reach a very wide customer demographic in urban, ex-urban, suburban and rural markets. With our fast growing inventories, our customers can discover something new in-store and online every time they visit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, is our global presence, with nearly 45 years of operating expertise in the U.S., 30-plus years in Canada and more than 25 years in Europe, we are an off-price leader in every country we operate in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Even in Australia, a country we have entered more recently, we are an off-price leader. We have spent decades establishing relationships with vendors and landlords, and building out our global buying offices, distribution networks, systems and infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Further, we have expansive country-specific knowledge of consumer shopping habits and have earned customer loyalty. We believe our well-established global off-price retail model and level of international expertise is a tremendous advantage, and our size and scale would be very difficult to replicate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019d like to walk through the reasons why we are confident, that we can drive sales and traffic growth in a normalized environment and why we continue to see a significant opportunity to increase our market share across each of our divisions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, we believe the appeal of our entertaining treasure hunt shopping experience, gives consumers a compelling reason to shop us. Based on what we\u2019ve seen for decades, including the past year, in-store shopping is not going away. We see our stores as a desirable destination for consumers seeking some stress relief or, quote, me time, unquote and also a great place to shop when they are seeking inspiration and looking to discover new things, which is difficult to replicate online.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, we see a significant opportunity to grow our global store base at each of our divisions. In total, we believe, we can open more than 1,600 additional stores to grow to about 6,275 stores in the long-term, just with our and our current countries. Availability of real estate is terrific and we see plenty of opportunities to open new stores or relocate existing stores.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Further, we believe our strategy of locating stores in convenient, highly accessible locations, makes it very easy for shoppers to find and visit us. We are anticipating incremental traffic once consumers return to their workplaces and go out more, as they will be passing by our stores much more frequently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next is our focus on marketing to attract new shoppers, while staying top of mind with our existing customers. This year, we have already launched new campaigns across television, digital and social media platforms for a number of our banners. These campaigns continue to reinforce our value leadership, while also highlighting discovery, fashion and quality. I hope, you have seen them, the creative is excellent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me take a moment to highlight a couple of them. First, we took a unique approach for Mother\u2019s Day and created a multi-brand music video in the U.S. that was highly successful and was viewed by more than 17 million times on YouTube over a two-week period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also did, an integration with the NBC prime show, The Voice, where each of the top 20 contestants were styled head-to-toe with products from Marshalls and performed a powerful segment lasting over two minutes. This work continues to reflect our leadership in fashion and value and helps us show that our stores can be for everyone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Further, we continue to see strong overall customer satisfaction scores where we are open including on our ongoing health and safety protocol measurements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, our research tells us that, overall, we continue to attract new shoppers of all ages into our stores, including a significant amount of Gen Z and millennial shoppers, which we believe bodes well for today and in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fourth, we see a great opportunity to capture a bigger share of the consumer\u2019s wallet due to other retailers closing stores. We also believe that these store closures may lead to even better product and real estate availability and more favorable lease terms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, we are investing in new stores and remodels, and our distribution network and systems to ensure we have the infrastructure in place to support our global growth plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, I want to again recognize the exceptional talent that we have across this entire company. With outsized open only comps in the first quarter, our organization really stepped up from buyers who successfully chased the goods in the marketplace, to our associates in planning and allocation, distribution centers, logistics and store operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Each of these groups has a vital role to play to ensure our merchandise flow and keep up with the consumer demand we have been seeing. It\u2019s the collective efforts of all of our associates and their dedication to TJX that brings our business to life for our customers every day in all kinds of retail environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our outstanding first quarter results tell us that consumers are seeking out our branded quality merchandise and great values. Clearly, they are enjoying our entertaining treasure hunt shopping experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall, open only comp store sales trends for the start of the second quarter remained similar to the first quarter. Looking ahead, I am convinced that TJX is very well-positioned to emerge from this health crisis in a position of great strength. We see numerous opportunities to continue our global growth and are excited about the runway for growth that we see ahead for TJX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott for a financial update and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Goldenberg</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Ernie, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to first echo Ernie\u2019s comments and thank all of our global associates for their hard work and continued commitment to our business. I\u2019ll start today with some additional details on our first quarter results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Ernie mentioned, overall open only comp stores increased an outstanding 16%. As you described in the press release, our first quarter open only comp store sales compare fiscal 2022 sales to fiscal 2020 sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the first quarter, we continued to see a very strong increase in our average basket as consumers put more items into their carts. In the U.S., where we open -- where we were opened the entire quarter, customer traffic compared to fiscal 2020 increased for the first time since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Marmaxx, we saw a significant improvement in customer traffic the fourth quarter and at HomeGoods customer traffic remained outstanding. Overall sales for the first quarter increased 129% over fiscal 2021, as stores were closed for approximately 50% of the first quarter last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">More importantly, when comparing to fiscal 2020, first quarter sales increased a very strong 9%, despite the negative impact of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of lost sales due to the temporary closings of our stores across TJX for about 14% of the quarter. These closures were primarily in Europe, which was closed for about 76% of the quarter, including essentially all of February and March, and in Canada, which was closed for approximately 25% of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pre-tax margin for the first quarter was 7.2% and merchandise margin was up slightly compared to fiscal 2020. During the quarter, we were very pleased with our strong mark-on and lower markdowns. However, these were mostly offset by significantly higher freight costs, which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the bottomline. First quarter earnings per share were $0.44. As detailed in our press release this morning, we believe the temporary store closures in Europe and Canada during the first quarter resulted in a significant loss of profit dollars, with an estimated negative impact to earnings per share of approximately $0.21 to $0.24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, I want to remind you that our first quarter pre-tax margin and earnings per share reflect some significant expense headwinds compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020. These include approximately $200 million of net costs related to COVID, approximately 40 basis points of additional interest expense and incremental costs from freight, supply chain and wage pressures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As for inventory, it was up 3% last year and store levels are where we want them to be. Our buyers are doing a great job sourcing merchandise and have been able to chase the goods we need to satisfy consumer demand. To reiterate, availability of merchandise is excellent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to our cash flow and liquidity, we ended the quarter in a very strong liquidity position with $8.8 billion in cash. With our strong liquidity, we took several proactive actions to deleverage our balance sheet and reduce our annual interest expense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First in April, we paid down the $750 million note that was due to mature this coming June at par. Secondly, this morning, we announced make-whole calls for our $1.25 billion principal outstanding 3.5% notes maturing in 2025 and our $750 million outstanding 3.75% notes maturing in 2027, both of which were issued last April. As a result of this action, we are expecting a pre-tax debt extinguishment charge of approximately $250 million in the second quarter. We expect the net results of both of these actions to be a $2.7 billion reduction in our outstanding debt and over 900 -- and over $90 million of annualized interest expense savings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Further, after these actions and including the tender refinancing this past November, we expect the average interest rate on our outstanding debt will be about 2.5%, which is in line with our pre-COVID level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, we declared a dividend of $0.26 per share in the first quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we\u2019re planning to declare a dividend at the same rate, subject to Board approval.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to the second quarter, as a point of reference for the start of the second quarter, overall open only comp store sales trends remain similar to the first quarter. For overall sales we are current -- we currently have approximately 300 stores that are temporarily closed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on what we know today, overall, we expect stores to be closed for approximately 3% of the second quarter, which includes Canada being closed for an estimated 17% of the quarter and Europe being closed for about 7% of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are planning a $275 million to $325 million negative impact to our overall second quarter sales due to the store closures. These expectations could be negatively impacted further, if current mandates are extended or new ones are put in place as they were last quarter. At this time, we are not planning any significant store closures in the back half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, we feel great about our first quarter results and the momentum of our business. We believe that a growing topline and a strong merchandise margin are excellent indicators of a healthy retailer. Additionally, we have a very strong balance sheet and are in excellent financial position to invest in our business to support our growth plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now we\u2019re happy to take your questions. As we do every quarter, we\u2019re going to ask you that you please limit your questions to one per person and one part to each question. We respectfully ask that everyone stick with this request to both keep the call on schedule and so that we can answer questions from as many analysts as we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks and now we will open it up for questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Omar Saad. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Omar Saad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Really great quarter. I would love to actually hear more on the traffic side of the equation. We know you guys do a great job once you get people in stores. Can you talk a little bit about the consumer\u2019s willingness to come back to the stores? How that\u2019s been building? Is it vaccine-related? Are you seeing that older customer come in as they get vaccinated and start to return to in-person shopping again? Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Ernie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Great question, Omar. Traffic has been very healthy. Scott will give you a little bit of a trend line discussion there, but nothing in terms of -- nothing standing out in terms of a difference in age demographics by the way. But we have such a broad-based age demographics across the business, so probably less likely for us there. But, Scott, on the traffic trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. It\u2019s hard to get real reason on the age. What we\u2019ve been seeing at least over the last couple of quarters is a significant number of the new customers that we\u2019re getting back are\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Omar Saad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I know\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 skewing even younger\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Omar Saad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 remarkably at HomeGoods that\u2019s even continuing. So, overall, the average age of the customers in both boxes is likely, when we finish up and get current results, probably, younger than it has been. So that\u2019s really good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The traffic patterns, once we got past some of the weather issues that we called out on our last call have been consistently strong through. We\u2019ll call it the Maple, the Fred [ph], that February, March and continuing right up to, as Ernie talked about, similar sales today. And that\u2019s at both more -- speaking really more Marmaxx and HomeGoods because of all of the closures that we\u2019ve had. So the basket has been remarkably strong\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Omar Saad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Strong average basket, Omar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And has not really decreased at all, so customers continue to put more units and the traffic continues to be strong and consistently staying that way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Omar Saad</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Boss. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Boss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great and congrats on the improvement as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Boss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it\u2019s kind of a two-part question, probably, more for Scott. I guess, first on merchandise margin. So the improvement this quarter relative to pre-pandemic despite the freight, I thought, was really impressive. I guess, so first, just sustainability or your ability to continue that trend in your opinion? But then second, at the EBIT margin level. So I think three months ago, Scott, you laid it out well, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But I think you basically said at a three comp, you see 30 basis points to 40 basis points of underlying margin pressure, but then we needed to consider freight, supply chain and COVID costs this year. So am I thinking about these pieces right and any factors or changes to these factors to think about now that we\u2019re three months later?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Matt, I think you\u2019re right, a lot of that is for Scott. I will just jump in on the merchandise margin, the healthy merchandise margin. Certainly, what we\u2019re seeing and it -- fortunately, it lines up with our model, and again, I give the teams a lot of credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We went in with the right amount of liquidity and so the teams did not -- I would say, they were right in the sweet spot of how much and this applies to all the divisions, most especially, obviously, right now, Marmaxx and HomeGoods buying to about the right level of trend. And then when you\u2019re staying on trend like that with what\u2019s going on the buyers have done a great job of being able to buy so opportunistically in the market. So that helped.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The sales being so strong has been a big benefit on our markdown rate, also helping our merchandise margin. As I said in my script, it\u2019s coming across, we\u2019re making very advantageous buys across whether it\u2019s the level of good vendors, moderate or best vendors, it\u2019s been everywhere, but in trending categories, which has been key.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019ve had certain categories that are outpacing the store and the merchants have done a great job of buying into those at the right cost and at the right retail, because, as you know, we\u2019re ultra-sensitive about where we retail are good at, and so, again, I give them a lot of credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will tell you, we have a challenge down the road here as we look into probably more like the third quarter, where last year we were up against almost an artificial margin bump up based on what had happened in the country during the COVID shutdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so there might be a little bit of a mark-on or markdown jeopardy in a window there of a few months where it\u2019s going to be a little more challenging and I think to show the merchandise margin at these rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And by the way, I\u2019m talking aside from freight, which has obviously gone up everywhere. I\u2019m talking kind of take that out of the equation. But we might have a little challenge there. However, we\u2019re so opportunistic, I have faith that we can do better than what we\u2019re probably thinking our challenges there. I will now let Scott talk to the margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I think just to reiterate a little what Ernie said on the merchandise margin in the back half. I mean, I think, if we compare it to -- again as we move, I think, the second quarter trying to make comparisons and we feel good about as Ernie, the overall merchandise margin, especially if you take freight out of the equation compared to two years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This third quarter last year where Ernie was comparing to 2021 is really on the mark-on and the markdowns. We also had some technical issues where we had some accruals in which -- and both on markdowns and shrink, which we reversed in the back half of the year, which are not a fiscal 2020 issue, but when comparing to last year or benefits that we saw last year in the back half that we won\u2019t repeat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s a good point, Scott. So just to clarify, Matt, what I was talking about on the challenge will be against in FY 2021, not against 2020 as much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So -- yeah. So the other aspect is in terms of some of the two-year flow-through, it\u2019s hard to isolate, especially when you look at the quarter we\u2019ve just had, when you have -- we have COVID costs, which we\u2019re still roughly in full force and we can talk about that more. But I would expect those to moderate and Ernie can talk about them more as we move through the second quarter and back half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think what -- at least at the moment is stubborn and we\u2019re still in the middle of assessing like everyone else are freight costs. But probably compared to both last -- what we -- when we talked three months ago and earlier in that, the freight costs are probably going to be stubbornly high at least for the rest of this year. As we\u2019re dealing with the same issues of driver shortages and rate increases likely to be higher than what we had originally thought. So I think that piece of it is still -- is going to be persisting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Having said that, we have been, I think, as Ernie mentioned, we\u2019re doing a great job of getting the goods. Paying more for it, but we\u2019re getting goods. Our inventories are in good shape and the buyer -- and our planning and allocation teams have been allocating those goods and doing a great job as you can see by our sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the other hand, the wage costs have been -- there\u2019s been pressure more. It\u2019s still stubborn in the DCs as we\u2019ve had a number of our DCs where we\u2019ve had wage -- increase our wage rates. But on the positive side, both in the stores and the DCs, although, we have pockets of challenges, we\u2019ve been able to hire back to our staffing -- close to our staffing levels we need to staff the store albeit at a deleverage compared to prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, again, the positive is, we adjust as necessary, but we\u2019ve been able to staff the stores and the distribution centers to meet the demand. So it\u2019s hard to compare with the lost sales in Europe and with the COVID costs exactly what those breakpoints would be on sales at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question call comes from Paul Lejuez. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Lejuez</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey. Thanks, guys. I want to talk about Marmaxx, specifically. Sales were up about $800 million or like 14.5% versus the first quarter of 2019 or you call it 2020, but margins are down 130 basis points. So I\u2019m just curious, if you can talk specifically within that business, how the deleverage, where that\u2019s coming from and what sort of increases you might need to see versus 2019 for margins to stabilize or is there some point in the year where you see the pressure points abating on that margin? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Again, I can certainly answer to the first quarter. Well, the second quarter goes back to what -- how COVID costs, how we drop, how those decrease, what costs -- we have to see what costs, and Ernie can talk a little about this in terms of how much apparel sales and how that relates to expenses in average retail. So to...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But COVID cost is a big reason for the deleverage, as well as others, but\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. The COVID costs alone to Ernie\u2019s point\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 in and of itself was more than the delta of the 130\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s what I would say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I don\u2019t want to be straightforward on that. We obviously would have leveraged and did leverage on those sales. But net-net, those two kind of wash each other and then the rest has to do -- which could get better again in the back half of the year having to do. We -- our average retailers were down, but they did get better as we move through the quarter as our apparel sales started to improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And also our -- and the rest of the deleverage was just due to our distribution center and wage costs. So the primary difference, I would say, they more or less offset each other was the COVID costs and the leverage, and then we still had the deleverage of wage in the DC expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kimberly Greenberger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Scott, I wanted to just talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on at international. When I look at the profit swing here in the first quarter compared to two years ago, it\u2019s about a $250 million negative profit swing from that $28 million operating income two years ago to the $222 million loss here this quarter. And if I -- if there\u2019s a reason to believe that international, once it reopens and sort of gets back to normal in the future, if it goes back to 2000 -- calendar year 2019 profitability. It would suggest that actually operating income in aggregate here in the first quarter would have been up about 10% from two years ago and that\u2019s even with all the COVID cost in there and all the freight inflation and the wages and everything else? So I\u2019m just -- it looks like the weight in the P&amp;L here in Q1, if I look at it from a different angle is really coming from that international piece and sort of everything else kind of came out in the wash and delivered pretty nice profit growth, if we sort of take that out? So to me it looks like you\u2019re probably offsetting a lot of that -- a lot of those cost pressures. Am I correct in that assumption? And as we move through the year and those COVID costs start to come off, does that mean that actually margins could get back to and maybe above where you were sitting in calendar year 2019? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. A lot of hypotheticals there. I think, you were looking at the first quarter, right? Where there was significant -- the two major delevers were the COVID costs and the loss on sales on Europe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Europe and Canada.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Europe and Canada. Yeah. With Europe being the bigger piece of that. So that is correct. As you would expect, you would offset a good chunk of that on the high average comps that we did get. And then, again, but the reason why we still would go down is, you still have higher than normal cost increases both in the wage and\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The freight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the freight in DC, so...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Freight. Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not all of that will go away in the back half. So we\u2019re not giving guidance, but I do -- I think as we\u2019ve said before, obviously, we don\u2019t know what the sales level, how high they could be. But you would expect us not, at this point, still to be reaching due to the some level of COVID costs and some of it is deleverage to be -- with the freight to be reaching the percent of 200 and fiscal 2020 or calendar 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Kimberly, at a high level the way you said that is the way that I\u2019m -- look, you can look at it that way this quarter, though, that if you had had. If we had had Europe and Canada on it, we would have had a lot on the wash, the differences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Scott mentioned this, we had such an overachievement on the sales that, I mean, you\u2019d have to be counting on a 16 open only comp sales and when the rest of Europe. If we have those type of comp sales, yeah, we\u2019d have a different discussion, where maybe the margin is back to more like those levels. But that you\u2019d have to have these way outpaced comp sales like we just did.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to your other point though, and Scott mentioned it, we are looking at the COVID cost, it is something we can take a hard look at here in the near future as we move ahead each quarter and as the environment normalizes, we\u2019re going to make some improvements on those lines. So that will help. So, I hope that answered -- hope that answered. We\u2019re -- we do believe there\u2019s sales upside all along.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And another plus we have on the cost line is our average retail has been moderating. And Scott, I think, started to allude to this as we go forward even into the back half, we\u2019re looking like it\u2019s going to moderate even more, because we\u2019re seeing some more best brands goods coming in on order as we get to the third quarter, which is going to help our average ticket and that should help our expense on processing come down a little bit. So, a very good question, a lot of moving parts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kimberly Greenberger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great color. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Trussell. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. My congrats as well on the improvement. I wanted to dig in a bit more on the topline and maybe you can discuss a bit more of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of category standouts, in particular, is there any sight of the strength in home decelerating? And I would love to hear more about your ability to really stay in stock and to what extent you\u2019re really out needing to case product in the marketplace\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 to keep up with this robust demand?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. No. Great, Paul. So, standout categories, I\u2019ll start with the most obvious one, which is our home business is remarkably consistent, as I said in the script. I mean, you\u2019re looking at 40 comps kind of what we did in the first quarter, and again, that basically was where we were in every division, even in the full family stores in a T.J. Maxx or Marshalls up in Canada, Homesense, so remarkable consistency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the neat thing there is we have a lot of broad-based consistency throughout our entire loan business. So whether it\u2019s big ticket areas like whether it\u2019s furnitures or rugs or decorative accessories, everything was good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There wasn\u2019t really one category. And this is where I give our teams, planning and allocation and this is not just in the home area. Our buying teams, our planning and allocation teams have been getting the goods fueling it so that the second part of your question was the deceleration in home.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have really not seen it -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to expect it to stay at that almost artificially high level than it did in the first quarter. But I think we have opportunity over the next quarter to stay up in the realm pretty close to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re not having a problem in the home area of stock -- staying at stock, which was the third part of your question and we\u2019re not actually having a problem where apparel has now started to improve for us. Paul, I think you\u2019re asking what else is standing out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we have a handful of apparel categories, which I won\u2019t give the specifics on which ones, but they are really kicking in as the quarter went on and going into the second quarter. And the nice thing that often happens is when the weather shifts and apparel kicks in, if there was a trend line prior, usually, our home business takes more of a hit where the consumer moves off of home for a little bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And yeah, again, our homes is going to continue at 40 comps, but it did not move off hardly at all. And our apparel just kicked in and that\u2019s one reason you\u2019re seeing these outpaced comps from us really at this first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Chasing product, flow of product has been a non-issue. I say, it\u2019s a non-issue because the teams have really executed so well and they\u2019re working so -- and I give logistics credit. I give really everybody involved credit to keep fuel. It\u2019s not easy to keep fueling a 16 comp and that\u2019s why I liked your question when you asked it, because it is an unusual time for us to be running an open only 16 comps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I just, again, give credit to all The TJX associates that are involved in that. Because they\u2019re making to happen, they have this position going into the second quarter every bit, as well as we were in the first quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.

Our next question comes from Ike Boruchow. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ike Boruchow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, everyone. My congrats. Scott, two questions for you on the cost structure and COVID costs. $200 million, I think you said this quarter, which is down from $270 million a quarter, which is what you\u2019re seeing in the back half. What\u2019s your expectation for that over the remainder of the year, I assume that there should be less cost in the model given the reopening and vaccinations, but kind of curious your thoughts there? And then my rough math is that your SG&amp;A per store, if I exclude the COVID cost is actually below where it was two years ago. Are you just -- are there things you\u2019re doing to run the store leaner? Are the costs you\u2019ve taken out, do you think are sustainable once we kind of normalize, just kind of curious how you talk about the cost structure on a per store basis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Great question. In terms of the COVID costs, we would -- right now we\u2019d expect them to be coming down in the second quarter slightly. And -- but I think, as Ernie said, we\u2019re going to evaluate that based on the environment and that we would be expecting them to be coming down substantially in the third quarter and fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In third quarter and fourth quarter, and to your point Ike, as the world more normalizes. What we\u2019ve been trying to do is keep associate and customer safety still. I guess, we\u2019ve looked at some of our -- and we\u2019ve talked about this, we have the greeters at the front of our stores, which have -- it\u2019s created a cost, but it\u2019s also created a customer service improvement perception and the safety, which is why we do believe that some of those extra costs have allowed us to play offense to actually drive our sales ironically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so we are going to ease our way off and not just do a pendulum swing quick move, because we believe it\u2019s been helping our topline. However, we know we need to moderate on that, and we will do it just like Scott said and we\u2019re going to take a hard look especially as you get to the third quarter and fourth quarter. So, hopefully, that -- I just want to give you some color on why we aren\u2019t going to necessarily move off it as fast because it\u2019s been a topline driver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of your question on SG&amp;A, I\u2019d actually have to get back to you in terms of, we\u2019re up about 4% on a per store basis versus 2020, but it\u2019s -- this quarter, it\u2019s a little difficult to have to segregate that out because you don\u2019t -- you have still have a fair number of expenses in Europe and Canada without the typical type of sales that you might expect and then we had the outside sales in Marmaxx and HomeGoods. So, overall, we were up about 4% versus fiscal 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ike Boruchow</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Binetti. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Binetti</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. Thanks for all the detail and taking my question here. I guess, Scott, just a simple question to try and help me boil all this down. Can you help us think what the SG&amp;A dollars are for the year and what you think COVID costs are for the year in the budget? And then with all the noise and you laid out the closures, I think, as we take the inputs you gave us, you probably excluding the closures would have been about $2 billion higher on sales versus first quarter fiscal 2020 and then when we add back your $0.21 to $0.24 that you pointed to, which was, I think, only for the closures, you\u2019d be at about a 9.9% to 10.4% margin in the quarter, compared to the 10.1% in first quarter two years ago? So with that as a starting point, I know you\u2019ve been asked to go through margins in a bunch of different ways. But with that as a starting point from here, it sounds like the incremental puts and takes all get sequentially better going forward except for freight, which you said you now got visibility that it\u2019ll be tough. But as you look at 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, you see the COVID costs coming down, international reopening, some of the AUR tailwinds, some of the mix moving back towards apparel. Am I thinking about that right, that if we kind of reorient to the first quarter last year that way that we should see sequential improvement in the underlying margin going forward through the model?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, a lot of this will depend -- I think, again, we\u2019re still evaluating the COVID costs. So not -- again, not giving up the cost save other than we expect them to moderate both in dollars and as a percent sales impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think Ernie reiterated on, one, a lot of it is still will depend on the merchandise margin in terms of what the -- what our mark-on and markdown will be and the level of sales. So, again, if we have outsized sales and we\u2019re able to buy better, the real wildcard is freight costs and how high they\u2019re going to be in the back half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But we didn\u2019t say that a lot of the other cost wins are going to be at least for now, the wage and the distribution costs we\u2019re cycling, opening up of both a lot of our facilities and we did a lot -- we opened six 3PLs or just additional, what we\u2019ll call processing space last year that we\u2019re going to go against in the back half and including Lordstown, a HomeGoods distribution center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I don\u2019t think our supply chain/wage are going to be levering at this point based on what we know and the wildcards really being merchandise margin and freight with COVID going down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think the biggest benefit to us getting better in our overall margins will be how far does COVID get down and what\u2019s our level of sales and if those stay high then we would expect to go to a higher level of pre-tax margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Sole. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Sole</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you so much. Ernie, I think, in one of your answers to the questions, you mentioned something about sales upside, and I think in the press release, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing consumers begin to resume more normal activities. Can you just talk about whether the strength in the quarter that you\u2019ve seen to date, how much do you think is still a tailwind from stimulus and how much is maybe just reopening consumers really just getting excited about going out and spend other things? And what the implication is for sales upside in Q2 and Q3 as you look out and the potential for sales growth rates remaining, to your point, unusually high?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So, obviously, when we looked at the first quarter and it\u2019s tough to measure we can\u2019t get at all that data specifically, we do believe the stimulus checks, et cetera, were part of it and clearly a pent-up demand issue, right, from people not having shopped and then we have the -- something we talked about, I think, it was in last call, you do have that revenge shopping aspect that I think comes out where people are passionate and want to get out there and we are entertaining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, pieces of that, but you have the store closure thing we talked about, which is going on all around us. So, we believe that, I would say, a chunk of our has not been just the stimulus and the -- to the best of our knowledge we wouldn\u2019t be entering the second quarter with a similar trend, which is why we specifically when we did the release, we put that last bullet point there, which is, I guess, is a little bit more specific than we normally would on how we start a quarter and why we wanted to say that we are entering it similarly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, you understand that the overall stimulus check thing isn\u2019t the only thing playing and it has to be some of those other issues in our business model store closures. By the way, I do believe our business model now resonates more than it even did pre-COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think consumers, if ever they have even more so now with all the stress of what\u2019s happened in the last year, they appreciate the treasure hunt entertainment, me time as I mentioned in the script , \u201cme time\u201d, they, I think our model and the fact that we talked about earlier on the call, we\u2019ve delivered a lot of exciting merchandise, which plays right into this time period. I think that\u2019s the vast majority of why we\u2019re getting the sales. And to point that\u2019s why I think there\u2019s sales upside as we look out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. I\u2019d\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know what I mean it\u2019s not just from the different stimulus government packages that have taken place, where we wouldn\u2019t be seeing what seems to be a pretty consistent trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think it goes back to what Ernie said, just a couple questions ago where, for the third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter our home sales were disproportionately benefiting us or the biggest piece of helping us out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the home sales now have continued to be strong and what\u2019s driving it as the apparel sales have gone up from the fourth quarter and as we\u2019ve moved and continued to be strong -- to be a big benefit, as we\u2019ve moved through up until as we speak today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the stimulus, as Ernie said was, is best we can term was more of a March, April factor, it probably waning as best we can determine. But now it has to do with the wardrobe people -- they didn\u2019t buy a lot of apparel last year in the first and second quarter and that\u2019s I think contributing to our strength right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So Jay to add one other thing in terms of market share gain as I look out here. Really through the balance of the year, is one of the advantages we continue to have in this home business. We learned to even improve on it is the way we learn to some of the merchants, a lot of merchants lunch or work virtually in a very effective manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our home division has a, as I mentioned, we have over 500 plus buyers in our home division that have collaborated just beyond even what we did before, as well as we have satellite offices for not just home that are overseas, that are now buying more merchandise for us than they did before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when you -- I feel we can continue to actually now drive and even more eclectic mix of home, which has the advantage that the consumer can buy it that day, if it\u2019s a piece of furniture they can try it and buy it. I mean, think, about all the delivery issues that have taken place or so that\u2019s all an added plus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, in addition to the apparel thing, Scott, was talking about, as well as some other that are hot categories in the industry, such as the beauty business. We have -- I give that team a lot of credit. We\u2019ve really been doing a nice job. They collaborate strongly across division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And again, some of the learnings that have taken place, I think, we\u2019re going to have a slight bit of advantage over what we did pre-COVID and the way we\u2019re able to flex and leverage all the different division\u2019s merchant knowledge. So I know long way, but that\u2019s a whole other piece that is making us feel even better about the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. And one thing we said when we\u2019re generally running well is the -- both at HomeGoods and Marmaxx, the consistency of the sales regionally, the consistency of the sales based on household income as best we can determine, consistency, in terms of the age of our stores -- our stores whether it\u2019s at HomeGoods and Marmaxx that are over 10 years and depending -- even going up as is all the 20 years and 30 years are doing significant comps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, it\u2019s that broad base sales that we\u2019re doing and then the good news is, at HomeGoods almost all our stores and Marmaxx, the 90%-plus, where our stores are in the suburban, ex-urban and rural areas. That\u2019s where our stores are located and so their strong strength across all of those three areas and the one area that\u2019s not doing as well would be the urban stores, but we just don\u2019t have that many of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jay Sole</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it.

And our last question comes from John Kernan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Kernan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Many congrats on managing through the quarter and congrats on the topline momentum. Scott\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Kernan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">\u2026 has the guidance for freight and supply chain costs gotten worse since you gave the fourth quarter out -- the outlook in the fourth quarter? I think it was 50 basis points to 60 basis points of pressure off count fiscal 2020 year, has that gotten worse? And then when we think about the leverage point in the model and the COVID costs continue to come out of SG&amp;A. What do you think is the comp leverage point? Is it four to five in the model? How do we think about getting back to that 10.6% operating margin from fiscal 2020?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. We had -- again, we have two -- we\u2019ve been saying this for the last that more than ever in cover too many puts and takes to get at this point what the breakeven in terms of getting back to the margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect our margins to get better as we move into the back half and we would expect them to get, significantly better next year to be -- we\u2019ll have to see what level our sales get to in the back half and then what, how some of these costs on freight and supply chain and wage pressure to determine what level of margin we\u2019re going to actually settle in at. But other than we expect both the back half, but certainly next year to be going up significantly in our pre-tax margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of freight. Yes, in terms of just even versus three months ago, we would expect -- we\u2019re not finalized at this point. But we certainly expect freight costs to persist and would be higher than what we would have anticipated three months ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Kernan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. So worse than the 60 basis points to 70 basis points of pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Goldenberg</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We should have given. I don\u2019t remember, giving the basis points, but we would be worse. It would just be worse than what we would have thought.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Kernan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you look John around the industry, it\u2019s just the freight rates continue to escalate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Kernan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understood.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ernie Herrman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah.
