Sir, the floor is yours.</span></p> <p><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong><span></span></p> <p><span>All right, thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the Analog Devices third quarter FY\u201916 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules, and our investor toolkit, which includes additional information that we believe will be useful for investors, you could find that at investor.analog.com. As usual, I\u2019m joined by ADI\u2019s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI\u2019s CFO, Dave Zinsner.</span></p> <p><span>So, before we start, let\u2019s get through some disclosures. Please note the information we\u2019re about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we have reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today\u2019s earnings release, which we\u2019ve posted at investor.analog.com.</span></span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And so with that let\u2019s get started. So revenue in the third quarter totaled $870 million and exceeded our revised guidance. Revenue increased 12% sequentially and increased 1% from the prior year. Our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure in the aggregate were slightly down sequentially but grew 4% over the prior year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Now let\u2019s talk about our results by end market. The highly diverse industrial market represented 43% of revenue in the third quarter. All industrial sub sectors were stable to up sequentially in line with expectations, but the timing of customer orders in the aerospace and defense vertical led to a weaker than anticipated performance in this sector in the quarter. The automotive market at 15% of revenue decreased 2% sequentially in the seasonally slower July quarter, but importantly returned to year-over-year growth increasing 3%. We believe the headwinds from the passive safety market have largely abated, and we\u2019re in fact very excited about our prospects for automotive revenue growth going forward.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Turning now to the communications infrastructure market, at 20% of revenue sales to our hundreds of communications infrastructure customers were stable sequentially and grew 23% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireless infrastructure decreased while wireline infrastructure applications revenue increased, as customers continued to build out metro and inter-data center network infrastructure for 100 gig and 100 gig plus optical networking.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Turning now to the consumer market, the consumer market typically drives significant ROI and free cash flow for ADI, and this market represented 21% of total sales in the quarter, increasing 131% sequentially. This strong sequential performance was due to better than anticipated portable consumer application revenue.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. With the exception of revenue and other expense, Dave\u2019s comments on our third quarter P&amp;L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $28 million for the quarter.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>When comparing our third quarter performance to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their comparable GAAP measures are included on Schedule E in today\u2019s earnings release.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So with that, Dave, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thanks, Ali, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was a very good quarter for ADI, with revenue increasing to $870 million and diluted earnings per share growing to $0.82, with both results exceeding our revised guidance.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Gross margin of 66% increased 20 basis points from the prior quarter as cost savings and lower spend in the fabs offset lower utilization rates and mix.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Inventory on a dollars basis decreased $7 million sequentially, and on a days basis decreased 16 days to 122 days. We\u2019re now expecting days of inventory to decline further in the fourth quarter and to be the range of 110 days to 115 days, in line with our model. Inventory and distribution channel on a dollars basis was modestly higher than in the prior quarter, and on a weeks basis remained at seven weeks, consistent with the prior quarter.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Operating expenses increased 2% sequentially, lagging well behind the 12% sequential increase in revenue as we continued to manage our expenses very tightly and gain operating leverage in our financial model. As a result, operating profit before tax of $296 million, increased 24% sequentially, and as a percent of sales operating profit before tax expanded 330 basis points to 34.1%. Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Given our recently announced acquisition of Linear Tech and related financing costs, we expect that our net interest expense will be approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter and remain at that quarterly run rate until we close the transaction. Our third quarter tax rate was approximately 10%, as we adjusted our full year tax rate down slightly to 12%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage, with diluted earnings per share of $0.82, increasing 28% sequentially on a 12% increase in revenue. Diluted EPS increased 6% over the prior year. At the end of the third quarter, our cash and short-term investment balance was $3.8 billion, with $860 million available domestically. We had approximately $1.8 billion in debt outstanding, which resulted in a net cash position of $2 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Our business strategy and consistent financial execution enabled strong free cash flow generation, which supports investments in our business and the return of cash to shareholders. Excluding a one-time item, over the past 12 months ADI has generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow, effectively converting each dollar of revenue into $0.32 of free cash flow, at the very high end of our free cash flow model range.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>In the third quarter alone, free cash flow margins expanded 600 basis points as compared to the prior year. In terms of cash returns to shareholders, over the past 12 months we have returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, which represents a 90% free cash flow payout.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>I want to now take a minute to talk about our capital allocation philosophy in light of the recently announced Linear Tech acquisition. As we mentioned when we announced the deal, the combined company\u2019s pro forma free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis ending April 2016, would have increased from $1 billion to $1.7 billion. After the deal closes, we plan to use our combined cash generation to rapidly pay down the debt associated with the transaction.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>As a result, we anticipate our net debt to EBITDA to go from 3.8 times at deal close to approximately two times net debt to EBITDA within three years of the transaction closing, which translates into an approximate $1 billion per year expected debt paydown schedule. In order to facilitate this rapid deleveraging, we have suspended our share repurchase program. That said, the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation philosophy, and we intend to maintain our dividend policy.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So in summary, this was a solid quarter on several fronts. We executed well in our business, and the diversity of our customers, applications, and markets, coupled with the sustainability of our innovation, enabled both revenue and diluted earnings per share to exceed our revised guidance. We\u2019re also very excited about the acquisition of Linear Tech, which we announced during the quarter, and I\u2019ll invite Vince to come on and say a few words in a minute.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the fourth quarter, which, with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes special items that are outlined in today\u2019s release. We\u2019re planning for another quarter of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. In the B2B markets of industrial, automotive, and communications infrastructure we are planning for aggregate demand to remain stable sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis to increase in the low-to-mid-single digits.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>In the consumer market, strong customer demand and increasing dollar content in portable applications, leads us to plan for continued sequential growth in this market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>In total, we are planning for revenue in the fourth quarter to grow sequentially, and be in the range of $910 million to $970 million. We expect factory utilization in the fourth quarter to be similar to its third quarter level as we manage our days of inventory, and so we are planning for gross margins in the fourth quarter to decrease approximately 50 basis points to 65.5% on the expected mix of business. We are planning for operating expenses in the fourth quarter to increase slightly sequentially, but to significantly lag our expected sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, and for operating margins to expand from their third-quarter levels. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Now before we move on to Q&amp;A, I\u2019d like to invite Vince to say a few words about the recently announced Linear Tech combination. Vince?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Great, thanks, Dave. As you know late last month we announced an agreement to acquire Linear Technology Corporation. This is a transformative acquisition that brings together the two best franchises in the analog industry, and once we combine our highly complementary portfolios, will make us a market leader across all major analog product categories. Following last month\u2019s announcement, I\u2019ve personally heard from many customers, from employees, and shareholders and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Our customers are excited to gain access to a comprehensive portfolio of the best brands in high-performance analog, the industry\u2019s best design engineers and FAE support, and a best-in-class supply chain all under one roof and with our continued commitment to the long-term support of our customers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Our employees as well are very excited by the opportunities created by combining our two complementary suites of high-performance analog products and technologies. Beyond that, both companies have long admired the technical expertise and acumen of the other, and our teams are looking forward to the collaboration and innovation possibilities when combining two of the best engineering teams on the planet.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>ADI and Linear are two amazing companies with very storied histories and vibrant cultures, and we plan to take the best of both companies to create something much greater than the some of the parts. We have many ties that bind us. We both believe that innovation and a passion for our customer\u2019s success drives superior business results, and we share an intense focus on operational excellence across quality, reliability, supply chain, and of course financial returns.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>As a result of this combination, our financial profile is expected to be among the best in the industry with strong margins and free cash flow, which we expect will increase over time as we realize the financial synergies and cross-selling opportunities inherent in this transaction. And as Dave mentioned, ADI\u2019s anticipated free cash flow generation is expected to increase significantly from current levels. We believe that this combination is good for all of our stakeholders. For customers it will create a true innovation and support partner that is unmatched in the industry. For employees it will create a tremendous opportunity for professional growth and the ability to help redefine an industry. And for shareholders this acquisition will further diversify our end market exposure and strengthen our business and financial profile. Notably, we expect this transaction to be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow, and anticipate non-GAAP EPS accretion of 10% right out of the gates. There is no other team of people out there who could accomplish what we believe Analog and Linear will accomplish together. And I\u2019m very excited to get started on the next phase of our journey together.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And so with that, we\u2019ll now start taking your questions.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>All right, great. Thanks, Vince. Just for callers on the line, just a quick reminder, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, I ask that you please requeue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness so that all callers get to ask at least one of their questions. So we plan to run the call until 11. And so I think that\u2019s plenty of time to get to everyone\u2019s questions.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So with that, operator, let\u2019s start the Q&amp;A session. Folks on the line can ask questions of either myself, Vince or Dave.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Question-and-Answer Session</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Ambrish Srivastava</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Hi. Thank you very much. I had a quick clarification and then my question. Clarification, Dave, you mentioned on the dividend policy, you have been raising dividend consistently for as long as I can remember. You did mean to imply that you would be raising dividend consistently like you have in the past? And then my question on autos, good to see the headwind from MEMS kind of abating. What are the areas that you are excited about as you alluded to that you should expect to see growth in that segment? Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay, I\u2019ll take the dividend question and I\u2019ll let Vince comment on the areas of automotive that we\u2019re excited about. On the dividend policy, as you know our model is to grow our dividend over time at a rate of 5% to 10%, and that continues to be our model.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Ambrish Srivastava</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay, thank you for that.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes. So okay on the automotive side, we play in three I would say premier spaces where innovation really matters. We play in powertrain and there for example we have new sensor technology. We have an ongoing stream of growth in the battery management area. And we have new modalities such as AMR, for example, managing or measuring very, very accurately sensing measuring torque, for example, which is an important modality in the car.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Also, our audio infotainment solutions are becoming more and more adopted across many, many platforms across the OEMs in the global market. For example, recently we saw that \u2013 you probably saw Ford announced our \u2013 we\u2019ve talked to you before about this A2B bus, a very, very efficient high integrity bus that\u2019s being used in the car to move media, audio media. Ford just announced with our brand the inclusion of that technology in two of their particular car models.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>We\u2019ve talked before as well about the growth of ADAS. We have a very strong position on 24 gigahertz radar solutions, microwave to bits, and we are starting to move with some very attractive solutions as well in the 77-gigahertz radar area. So I think we\u2019ve a good spread of technologies across the various car platforms using our underlying strength in sensing, measuring, and interpreting in both the precision signal processing area as well as the very, very high speed signal processing area.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Great. Thanks, Vince, and thanks, Ambrish, for the question. I think, Ambrish, you do highlight a good point which is if you actually look at our automotive business, excluding the passive safety area. We\u2019ve actually grown that business in the high-single digits year-over-year in the quarter. And I think that really speaks to the additional content that we\u2019re getting into vehicles now, as Vince mentioned. And that we are really excited about going forward as well. So thanks for the question, and we\u2019ll get to the next caller please.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Tore Svanberg</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, thank you, great numbers. So my question is on the consumer business. So up 130% sequentially. Could you just talk about the dynamics there, how we should think about that business here in the back half of the year? Clearly a very volatile business but yes, if there\u2019s anything you can add on the actual trends in the second half, that\u2019d be great. Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So Tore you mean trends in terms of how is going to do next quarter you mean?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Tore Svanberg</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Well, just obviously 130% is not the actual growth of that business.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Right.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Tore Svanberg</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Obviously think about the volatility?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, I would say in the fourth quarter it certainly going to be up again. That\u2019s going to be the driver of the sequential growth. Probably in the high 20s, low 30s percent virtually. Then the next quarter, last year we declined about 60%, I think, sequentially. But that was, partially it\u2019s due to seasonality and then the other part of it that, there was a build of inventory last year in the fourth quarter and we had that kind of consumption of that inventory in the channel that affected demand for us.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>This year I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side. So I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter but only seasonally. I don\u2019t think we would have this kind of ramp down due to overbuild in the inventory side of things in the supply chain. So it's probably going to be roughly half the rate of what we saw last year sequentially.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>I think the way to look at this market overall, Tore, we take a long-term view to the consumer market like we do to all our markets in which we participate. We're picking out \u2013 with our customers we're picking the hardest problems to solve, we\u2019re pointing our technology at these problems, and we look for areas where we can get sustainability from generation to generation. So we take a long-term view and then the market will do what the market does in terms of generation. But I think in the areas that we're playing, we're executing well, and we've got some very, very exciting technologies in the pipeline as well for the future here.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Tore Svanberg</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>That\u2019s s great color. Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes. Great, thanks, Tore, that's was a great question. And then I just pointed as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks that business for ADI drives very strong ROI, very strong free cash flow business for the company; and if you note that certainly consumer grew a 131% or so, sequentially the operating margins for the company also expended \u2013 for the entire company expanded well over 300 basis points as a result, so great business to be and if you pick your spots. All right, we\u2019ll get to our next caller please.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Tristan Gerra</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Good morning. Just quick follow-up on the consumer question. You talked about some content increase, can you quantify this a little bit?

Next caller please.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Craig Hettenbach</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, thank you. As you work toward the Linear Tech deal, can you give us an update on just the Hittite integration kind of how it\u2019s going versus initial expectation a couple of years ago? And then also just from a cross-selling perspective how that\u2019s performed in the opportunities that you have?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay. So I\u2019ll talk about it from an operational standpoint and then Vince can talk big picture about how it\u2019s gone. Just operationally I would say we're pretty much fully integrated. We had expectations to get synergies that would drive the kind of accretion up into the kind of high-teens and we've actually been successful with that, in fact we're actually a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be from an expense perspective. From a revenue pipeline perspective, we have seen a lot of activity in terms of design ins and in some case design wins where we have been either able to take product that Hittite sold and bring them into our customer base.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>We\u2019re actually vise versa, for example in the case of the military business, they've actually been able to bring ADI parts into their customer base. And that's going quite well. I would say that\u2019s exceeding our expectations. I wouldn't say that it shown up significantly on the revenue line just yet nor that we expect it to. This is \u2013 these are markets that have long design level, but from everything we can tell just looking at how the activity has transpired from the time we close till where we are today, we think we are ahead of where we thought we would be. I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, that\u2019s good color, Dave. I think we're approaching the LTC combination very much as we did with Hittite. We \u2013 I think with both Hittite and LTC, we share the same values essentially, we're very innovation centered, we very, very high standards in terms of how we execute in supply chain quality and financial returns. And that's not negotiable, that's what we strive for in these combinations. Obviously the cultures are different, but I view the cultural diversity as an opportunity to improve both companies.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>You know there are \u2013 when you get world-class companies who've been doing things very, very well as they were independently, you\u2019ve got to listen very carefully and understand what each side has been doing and do your best to combine the entities to create something greater than the some of the parts we did that with Hittite and that's the approach we're taking as well with LTC.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And when I look at the combination of Hittite with ADI, for example, with our customers in communication infrastructure, broad-based communications activity, in the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense areas, it's really exciting to see how we are now solving big problems from end-to-end. We\u2019ve got the unique capabilities. I think we are probably the only high performance microwave to big supplier out there that can run the gambit of technologies and solve big footprint radio problems for our customers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So I think obviously with LTC, we get the real strength that they bring in the power area and some of the mix signal areas in the little niches. So my sense is we will take the very same approaches that we did with Hittite, we've learned a lot as well through the process. And we will \u2013 as I said, listen very, very carefully to making sure that we understand the best practices that we use them across technology, product development, supply chain quality and customer support, of course.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Craig Hettenbach</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Got it. Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi Group.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Chris Danely</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Hey, thanks guys. So if we incorporate your guidance for the individual product segments for the fiscal Q4 for fiscal 2016, I think comm industrial and auto are all essentially flat. So what sort of growth would we expected for those three segments? And you can just do relative if you want for fiscal 2017 and then how much would consumer would up \u2013 would be expect to be up for fiscal 2017?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Difficult to say at this point how all the stuff is going to transpire. We actually haven't done our plan or annual operating plan for 2017 yet, which is due to happen in the next couple of months. I would say that our expectation is that the industrial market grows normally and kind of in the mid-single digits kind of GDP plus a little. So I think that's kind of how we're building it, whether that happens in 2017 probably has more to do with how the macro does than anything, but I think it's a good rule of thumb to think about the growing in those kind of rates.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Automotive I think over time should be back into the levels that Ali talked about with the sub segments which is to grow in the high-single digits, it's been way down a bit obviously by this passive safety business kind of coming off, but that\u2019s kind of running its course. It seems to be the driver for automotive stay flat; it\u2019s still going to be a little bit of a headwind although a smaller headwind into next year. But I think automotive has a chance to start to move, I think it grew a few percent or will have grown a few percent this year, probably grows mid-single digits next year and probably grows up to the high-single digits the following year given all of the exciting opportunities we have that Vince talked about.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>In the comm space if anybody guess I think over time we think that our technology which is ahead of competitors will allow us to drive share gains in that market. And so even if the market itself, the CapEx environment of comm infrastructure market is kind of really low single-digit CapEx increases year-over-year, we think we will grow faster than that because of our position in that marketplace.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And then the consumer market, obviously it was down or should be down most likely year-over-year this year as we won't have the same inventory build we had last year which kind of hit us this year. But I think next year as an opportunity to have a pretty decent year because this year was actually way down by the fact that they were digesting inventory in the first half of the year. Next year that won\u2019t be the case, on top of that we will get the full year effect of the dollar content improvements that we got at the end of this year. So we're cautiously optimistic about the consumer business having a decent year next year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Chris Danely</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Great. Thanks a lot, Dave.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Sure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question is Craig Ellis with B. Riley.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Craig Ellis</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, thanks for taking the question. Dave, I was hoping you could just comment on the ends of the outlook range on revenues. Is the gap between the low end and the high end just allowing for still uncertain macro or is it just related to violence is in any of the segments for different types of build plan assumptions? And any color on what would swing things to the low end or high end would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Good question, Craig. A part of it is the fact that consumer tends to have a little bit of uncertainty built in. Come in with quite a bit of backlog but sometimes that backlog can shift around towards the end of the quarter a little bit and that can affect the quarter number even though it doesn\u2019t affect kind of the full build plan over time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>The other piece was you just have to build a little bit of cushion in for kind of a macro uncertainty that might hit us at some point. We don\u2019t expect that which is why kind of the middle of the range is a pretty decent increase. But we did build in some cushion just in case something kind of surprised us. But I would tell you that we come in, in a very good position from a backlog perspective. And so although we give a wide range, we feel pretty good about them hitting the middle part of that range. And if things go better than that, we could hit the higher end of the range.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>All right, great. Thanks, next question.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Amit Daryanani</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thanks, good morning, guys. Just a question on the industrial side. Sounds like part of the year-over-year decline was driven by this aerospace and defense orders getting pushed out, are the timing getting pushed out [indiscernible]. Can you just talk about what sort of revenue did you end up missing, in July quarter because of that? And is it logical to assume that you picked this backup in the October quarter and you could see a better growth in the industrial segment in that case?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, so the industrial weakness was really, as Ali actually mentioned, it was really specific to aerospace and defense that\u2019s programmatic sometimes in certain particular quarters they may not take as much as we have forecasted just by the timing of the programs. We do expect that to resume in the fourth quarter, come back in the fourth quarter. And that was really the most significant impact. We didn\u2019t really expect industrial to have significant improvement sequentially. So it\u2019s not all together surprising that we were down $10 million. But it was in that kind of range that where the miss occurred.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>On the automotive side, I would say we kind of hit where we thought we would. We thought we would be down around 3%, I think we\u2019re down sequentially down 2%. So we did actually marginally better than we expected in the automotive space. So that\u2019s going, I would say better than expected.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes. And let me just give you a little color on the industrial segment if I can, I mean really everything within the industrial space performed as we had expected, everything was stable to slightly up sequentially. Let me give you a little more color then. In North America we had a good quarter in factory automation. We believe that\u2019s driven by stabilization in the oil and gas space. In China, renewable energy did particularly well. And as Dave mentioned the aerospace and defense area hit a bit of an air pocket this quarter. But I think if you look it on a trailing 12-month basis that business has actually done very, very well for ADI.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And really the acquisition of Hittite has really, as Vince mentioned earlier, reinvigorated that business for us. We\u2019ve got a guy who is running that business he\u2019s doing an amazing job. What I think is a pretty expensive portfolio in that area. So we think A&amp;D is actually a growth market for us going forward. And there \u2013 in there the customers are really looking at these old mechanical systems that are expensive and they are looking to replace them with higher performance cheaper silicon solutions and that really increases our content meaningfully in those systems overtime.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So I think looking at any of these markets in a quarter, particularly in lumpy markets can be fraught with peril. I think if you take a longer-term view, I think these markets are doing pretty nicely for ADI. So well appreciate the question and next question.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess in the third quarter then you mentioning about $10 million offset from the aero, but you had originally guided the B2B business up in the mid-to-upper single digits.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>$10 million differential still wouldn\u2019t quite get you there. So I\u2019m wondering what other areas in the quarter were potentially weaker than you thought. And I was also hoping if you could give us a little more color on the segment basis for what you expect for the next quarter beyond just the aggregate platform.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Right. Well the other area that was little less than planned was the communications market, it declined about 1%, I think sequentially. We expected that business to be up this quarter.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>In mid-single digits</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>I would say that was customer specific.

That was the other area that surprised us. And then your other part of your question Stacy is how I expect the end markets to play out in the fourth quarter. I would think that we mentioned B2B was likely to be flat. I think the combination of industrial and auto is likely to be up a bit and I think communications might be marginally weaker.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Stacy Rasgon</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Excellent, next caller.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Blayne Curtis</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, you got interest income up throughout \u2013 until the close of the deal. Could you just talk about what debt you're adding and at what interest rate? And does that come off the $7.3 billion that you are planning on raising to acquire Linear?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, it\u2019s really just the \u2013 so when we executed the agreement with Linear Tech \u2013 Linear, we had to enter into a underwriting commitment with set of banks to provide, so that the funding was essentially guaranteed. We haven\u2019t drawn any of the money, but banks don't agree to do that without you agreeing to pay them something. So the step up from what was about $12 million a quarter up to what is going to be around $20 million give or take is really that cost of them providing that commitment, even though we haven\u2019t borrowed anything.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>That then goes away once we enter into the agreement with or rather close the deal with Linear Tech. And then there\u2019ll be a new financing cost obviously which is actually the drawn down amount, which as I indicated was going to be around 3% pretax on what was sort out being $11 billion but quickly paydown to about $7.5 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Blayne Curtis</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Perfect, thanks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thanks, Blayne.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Ross Seymore</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Hi, guys. Just want to ask a question on the communications area. That in past calls you\u2019ve been pretty bullish about the expectations there. I know you talked about the wireless being weak in both the quarter and it seems like even in the guide you are talking comms being a little bit weaker. Can you talk about any confidence or what level of confidence you have in that communication segment growing going forward?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So we look at the comms infrastructure market in general, it\u2019s a very important market for ADI. And as always we take a long-term view to how we invest, how we pick our spots and how we invest there. So we\u2019re solving radio problems for our customers, I believe with a level of completeness that is quite unique. And with the addition of Hittite to our portfolio we\u2019re very well-positioned in microwave to bits. And of course with the addition of the linear portfolio we\u2019re able to attach the high-performance power products which will enable us to even offer more complete solutions to our customers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So I think the way to look at this market whatever happens with the short-term gyrations the challenges that our customers are facing are really immense. The problems are getting harder and harder from generation to generation. They are trying to solve the ongoing problem with spectral efficiency, information integrity, power efficiency and those problems will persist. And we\u2019re in a better position than ever to solve these problems.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So the markets are going to gyrate, its very, very hard to predict its quite a lumpy business as we always say, its hard predict quarter-to-quarter what\u2019s going to happen. But we view the whole comms infrastructure area as, really the electricity of the modern economy and the things that are under our control, how we innovate, how we engage with our customers. We\u2019re doing better there than ever, we continue to make improvements and I believe we\u2019re poised to take share. So whatever the market is we\u2019re poised to take share as the years move on here. So I think that\u2019s the way to view communications infrastructure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>All right, Ross. Thank you, good question. The next caller.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Harlan Sur</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So within your broad-based industrial business, can you just talk about the geographical demand trends you saw in Q3, I know you touched upon some specific product drivers in certain geographies? But maybe just touch upon sort of the broad geographical trends, particularly China since I think your industrial business in China has been a strong driver over the last couple of quarters.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And then maybe touch upon what\u2019s implied within the fourth quarter industrial guidance again from a geographical perspective. Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Sure. Good question Harlan, let me take that one. Okay so by region I\u2019d say North America and Europe were a little bit weaker sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, even though factory automation was quite strong in North America, our A&amp;D business tends to be more focused in North America. And so as a result of that being weak, North America ended up being a weaker region for us in the industrial space. China was very strong again as you mentioned it is a key area for us in the industrial space. That was strong on instrumentation, applications, smart city and energy type applications. And as I mentioned earlier North America factory automation was pretty strong on stable oil and gas.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>As we look forward to the fourth quarter, it's actually an interesting question that you post because generally speaking the fourth quarter for industrial tends to be down in the mid single-digits. This time we\u2019re expecting industrial to be pretty stable to the third quarter level and there's a few reasons for that why we're feeling I guess relatively bullish on that market in the next quarter. The aerospace and defense sector we expect to come back a little bit in the following quarter. And frankly if you look at the orders in distribution, they are currently pretty strong and I think if you compare that to some of the outlooks painted by some of the larger distributors out there, their book-to-bills are trending at parity or above parity so that would support the strong flows we\u2019re seeing in distribution.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So as a result I think when you package up all of those disparate points we come up with a view the next quarter, the industrial market should be pretty stable to its third quarter levels here, so hopefully that answers the question and will get to our next caller.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Cody Acree</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Hey, thanks guys for taking my questions. With the Linear acquisition what are your long-term thoughts on your capacity needs and how that might impact margins?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>What we'll have four fabs on a combined basis and so we'll have plenty of capacity for the future demand of the business. We've had utilization down this quarter expected to be down next quarter, probably would be down again in the first \u2013 at this level in the first quarter again. And then it steps up a bit, their utilization is actually pretty good. So I think that for the foreseeable future, I think we feel pretty good about what our capacity looks like.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, I think job number one when you think about fabs and foundry. So the job number one is to make sure, that across the huge breadth of SKUs that we've got that are very, very important to particularly our industrial and B2B customers. Job number one is to make sure we have no supply chain interruptions whatsoever. Both LTC and ADI have, we got very, very high scores for being able to supply a huge diversity of products. Over very, very long periods of time and that's a tremendous value to our customers. So job number one is to make sure that we don't diminish that value in any way. And as Dave said, we manage utilization on a dynamic basis to make sure that we met supply and demand and that will continue to be the way.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes.

Can you give us some idea in the longer run how 5G might affect your content opportunity and comps infrastructure. Is there any additional opportunity or are the systems essentially the same?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Well, apparently the demand for spectral efficiency is going to increase several orders of magnitude. And one of the methods that they're going to use to get there obviously the bandwidth has got to increase but we\u2019re going to be moving well into the microwave area. So the complexity of the problem is going to significantly increase in terms of all the things that we've been talking about, in terms of spectral efficiency, power management, power efficiency, obviously cost per bit and so and so forth. So with each successive generation, there has been more pressure on the technology to deliver ever increasing levels of, as our customers with a productivity, innovation productivity. So our belief, David, is that we're looking at orders of magnitude of complexity increase, which will continue to put pressure on our technology. But that's in our wheelhouse. That's what we like. We like hard problems to solve. That's what we build our business on.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>David Wong</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Great.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thanks, David. Thank you next question.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>John Pitzer</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes. Good morning guys. Thanks for let me ask the question. Dave, I wanted to go back to the consumer business. If I look at a year-over-year compare, July quarter consumer was down about 10, the midpoint of your guidance is down close to 20% year-over-year and notwithstanding sort of the inventory issues last year, I would have stopped the July quarter would have been a more difficult compare quarter because my understanding was that July last year benefited from builds beginning early in the quarter throughout the quarter. And this year the July quarter really only benefited from the month of July builds for handsets. And so I'm kind of hoping you can kind of help circle, or square the circle there for me as to why year-over-year growth would be so much worse in the October quarter than the July quarter in the consumer business?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes. I mean simply put, John, we just had an inventory build that was pretty significant in the fourth quarter. And we do not expect hopefully to have had happen this time around. It will be more closely aligned with demand. I would say that we do have a range and as you get to the higher end of the range that would suggest a lower \u2013 I guess a lower year-over-year decline, yes I guess would be the way to describe it. So that's obviously a possibility but not what we've built into the plan or the midpoint of the forecast.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>John Pitzer</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And Dave did the July quarter only benefit from builds in the month of July or did builds happen earlier in July quarter than we thought or than you initially thought on the last conference call?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>No, it was definitely more of a July ramp in the third quarter. I would say that probably on a weekly basis, was probably at a higher level than it was last year on a direct compare of the months of July for this year and last year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>John Pitzer</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Sure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span>Operator</span></strong><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>William Stein</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick question around the Linear acquisition. First can you remind us of the timing, expected timing to close? And Dave, can you also sort of relate your early experiences coming to ADI and then also your experiences working to help integrate Hittite and maybe string a narrative as to the types of things we should expect to hear around integration when that begins.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay, I\u2019ll let Ali talk about the timing piece.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay, all right sounds good. So, yes, I realize that question is top of mind regarding time, but we\u2019re not going to comment on the regulatory approval process at this stage. You see the conditions to the closing the transaction including required regulatory filings, they are all going to be in the Form S-4 registration statement and the proxy statement that ADI and Linear will be falling in connection with the merger in the upcoming weeks. So that takes care of the timing, Dave.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Good lawyered up comment, Ali.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay, so on the\u2026</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>William Stein</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>I'm a good reader\u2026</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>On the integration side, obviously this is going to be different. It's bigger. It's on a different coast so it's not quite as \u2013 it's not in our backyard so we have that aspect of things. But I would say fundamentally it's going to be similar. What I think we do is, we buy really good companies and really good companies don't need to be fixed. And what we try to do is take the best aspects of each company and leverage them in the combined company to make something better than the some of the parts. So that's really what we intend to do. We're just in the initial planning stages as we speak. We\u2019ll probably have a more formalized plan as we work with our compatriots over there at Linear Tech to help to form a good integration plan together.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And I think that will take the better part of the rest of our fiscal year to really kind of come to conclusion on. And then once we do have I think a more clear plan will definitely communicate that to investors and to analysts. But at the moment, I think just our fundamental premises take the best of both companies and make a better company is really how it's going to, the main ethos of the integration.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>I think its going to go well. I think we did a great job at Hittite doing those same things and every integration is different but I think the elements of that process are pretty much going to be the way, we approach at this time. And so I suspect it's going to be a really great combination, just the early reads from every customer we've heard from, our employees, as we've been able to talk, clearly about the Linear Tech, we haven't gotten to every Linear Tech employee yet, but the ones we have talked to I think they got the excitement of what this could mean and so I think it\u2019s going be a tremendous combination.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>William Stein</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thank you.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Sure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thank you.

Thanks a lot guys. Vince, something you could maybe give a high level strategy comment, ADI obviously been very strong over the years in analog to digital converters, good amplifier portfolios with Linear adding, as you mentioned, fantastic power. Since you've got pretty much the soup to nuts great stuff on Analog, as we think about increasing IoT applications out there which traditionally hasn\u2019t been a big market for you guys, but if you think about that starting to invest more in digital makes sense may be ramping up investing DSP. I was just curious of your high level thoughts on where you go after you got the complete Analog portfolio here.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, great question. Good question, Steve. So, yes, we view the IoT, it is the great kind of latest marketing buzz in the world of semiconductors today. But we view IoT has really an extension of the things we already do, so there's a need for precise sensing, precise signal conditioning and conversion at ultra low power levels. And our customers are asking us for, to be able to take some of the bits we generate and develop information to interpret with the bits and give them information which we do in areas for example like reliable healthcare monitoring.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So I think the way to view it is we've got a platform of technologies that we apply to industrial applications, take industrial automation for example. So we've got the conversion technology, signal conditioning amplification, we got processing both on the DSP side. We've fixed function processing that was developed. We're quite a large user of ARM technologies for example a lot of our products now use \u2013 MCUs, very, very low power MCUs, which we traded for our applications. With the RF technologies that we can bring to bear for the connectivity and obviously power management is the core part of the overall solution as well.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So the underlying foundation of silicon technologies will be supplemented over time with more algorithmic technology and lyric for example that we acquired several years ago is a key player in enabling us to bring out algorithmic technology to bear. We're looking at how we make each \u2013 anything that gets connected need security, so as connectivity in the IoT sector is synonymous, it needs security, so that something that we're actually experimenting with. We're looking at possibilities to acquire some technology there as well.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>So that's \u2013 what I've described to you is we've got a very, very broad base of technologies that are enabling ADI in our traditional markets, these more connected are IoT markets, where sensing, measuring and interpreting is very, very important. And we're looking for token technologies and organic developments to move to ADI further up the stack for the example into the interpretation using algorithmic technology as well as security and communications.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Steve Smigie</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>All right.

This is Shankar on behalf of Vivek. A lot of good question asked about the segments but I just want to ask about the OpEx side of things. You guys mentioned you're having a tight OpEx control right now in Q3 and Q4 just guided to flat go up. But given Linear deal, are you going to be focused on keeping the OpEx at current levels till the deal close? Could you just talk about the trends from Q4 to middle of next year and then how you think about the business long-term?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Okay. So I think when history is written on 2016, we will have been roughly flat year-over-year in OpEx. So I think I'd concur with you that\u2019s a pretty good OpEx control. I think our goal is really to be largely flat next year at the ADI level. And what we'll do is in certain cases reprioritize our investments into areas that we're more confident around the growth levels and shift things around as appropriate and not seek to add a lot of resources particularly as we're going to get a whole bunch of resources hopefully by the middle of next year in the form of Linear Tech in place. So that's kind of the goal \u2013 it likely means that OpEx normally comes down in the first quarter just because the revenue comes down and then it pops back up in the second quarter if revenue is kind of seasonal, but kind of roughly in these kinds of zip codes, plus or minus $10 million from where we are today.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Needless to say we're operating as two independent businesses till we close. So we're all the time, we're very opportunity-rich as a company and we're all the time looking to pick the best opportunities, make sure they're properly funded, and we're always looking for talents. So within the boundaries of an OpEx model that is spending 18% or 19% in R&amp;D that's what we intend to do and scale it with revenue growth over time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"question\"><strong><span>Shankar Iyer</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Got it.

I would tell you as we enter sort of the back half of the year for ADI the consumer business has some positive seasonality. And so it actually performed quite nicely on a sequential basis and it was about stable to the prior year.

Hi, thanks a lot. I believe at one point you gave a full year CapEx target of $140 million to $150 million, you're running below that. Is that because of the Linear deal perhaps getting accessed to some equipment and factory outputs and maybe there's some spending you won't need here?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>No, we're just generally sent a budget that we're going to spend at 4% of revenue in \u2013 I think coming into year we thought \u2013 we didn't suspect this air pocket we'd run into on the consumer side and so we had a higher expectation on CapEx, but given that the revenue was a bit lower, we lowered the CapEx to this so we could maintain the 4%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, and so the new numbers somewhere in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the year or so.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thanks, Ian.

Thanks for taking for my question. Just given some of the color earlier on some of the growth in your wired infrastructure business because of the 100 gig optical. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on whether that's primarily driven by hyper scale data center customers or if there are some teleco carrier CapEx that\u2019s driving that as well? And related to that is looking forward is set pretty much running in line with demand or is there some big element of capacity build ahead or build out for us \u2013 for consumption around this year? Thanks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Vincent Roche</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, good question. It's driven by demand. I think there's a very, very good balance between what we're seeing in terms of demand and supply. There's obviously a huge amount of activity in the intra data center connectivity, and we're participating in that with our customers, also long haul and kind of metro build outs, and I think there's a good balance between the three, but it seems that the data center is hotter at this point in time and looks like it will be a wave for several years to come. So I think it's a good mix and very good balance between demand and supply here.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>All right, Stephen, thanks.

Muse</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Yes, good morning, thank you for squeezing me in. I guess a quick question around the Linear merger; curious what kind of conversations if any you've had in terms of locking up talent there.

And I expect that to be what it will \u2013 that will maintain its pace for many, many years to come. People remain with these companies because we do exciting things. We solve big, big hard problems. We've got very strong cultures. And I believe that just as it was so with Hittite and ADI, it is our goal to make sure that we win the hearts and minds of all of our engineers, who really create the value for both companies, and I'm very confident about that based on the conversations I've so far had with the LTC leadership and I see that as being a tremendous value and strength of both companies.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Dave Zinsner</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>And I would say that from an OpEx management perspective we run in this \u2013 into this every time we integrate a company there are always slight differences in terms of how the compensation works and I think we're pretty good at figuring out a way that we can do it that works for employees and keep them energized and engaged and simultaneously doesn't have an impact on our total OpEx and our ability to manage our OpEx appropriately. So we haven't worked out the particulars of that and that will also be done over the coming months. But I feel pretty confident that we'll be able to address employees concerns and shareholders concerns and come up with something that's optimal.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span class=\"answer\"><strong><span>Ali Husain</span></strong></span><span></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><span>Thanks C.J.
