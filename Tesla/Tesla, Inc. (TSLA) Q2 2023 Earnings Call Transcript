My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations. And I\u2019m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives.</p> <p>Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 pm Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.</p> <p>During the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&amp;A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?</p> <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Martin. So, just a Q2 recap. In Q2 we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries, and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the bestselling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So, it was the number one vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This is, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, we managed to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year. Although, we expect that Q3 production will be<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> a little bit down because we\u2019ve got summer shutdowns to -- for a lot of factory upgrades. So, just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the long-term, autonomy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling next level. And our sort of future robotaxi products -- dedicated robotaxi products we think have like quasi-infinite demand. The way we\u2019re going to manufacture robotaxi is, is also itself a revolution. So, it\u2019s revolutionary design made in a revolutionary way. It\u2019ll be by far the highest units per hour of any vehicle production ever. So, very excited about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural net with data from millions of vehicles. The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again. The more training data you have, the better the results. And, I mean, there are times where we see basically -- in a neural net, basically it\u2019s sort of at 1 million training examples, it barely works; at 2 million, it slightly works; at 3 million, it\u2019s like wow, okay, we\u2019re seeing something, but then you get like 10 million training examples, it\u2019s like -- it becomes incredible. So, there\u2019s just no substitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all of the companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order of magnitude. So, I think we might have 90% of all -- or a very big number. So, the success in AI endeavors is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources. And we have outstanding capabilities in all three arenas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I really just don\u2019t know how anyone could do what we\u2019re doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have the training data. So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training. It is designed to -- it\u2019s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training. So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is just enormous. So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear. But there\u2019s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a 100 exaflops by the end of next year. So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD beta. That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very quickly. It\u2019ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles. And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver, so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware 3, 4, but it\u2019s really dedicated. It\u2019s a high efficiency inference computer that\u2019s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla\u2019s clearly at the cutting edge of AI development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin. I\u2019m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truck that we\u2019re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So, it\u2019s sort of biggest on the outside, but it\u2019s even bigger on the inside. So it\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter. So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really maximize the utility of the volume. And we can\u2019t wait to start delivering it later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it\u2019s now called the North American Charging Standard. We\u2019re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general. So, that\u2019s the goal there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we\u2019re not license -- in that case not licensing, we\u2019re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So, we\u2019re not trying to keep this to ourselves. We\u2019re more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we\u2019re incredibly excited about what\u2019s to come. Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter. And then lastly, I\u2019d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact you\u2019re making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Martin Viecha</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Zachary Kirkhorn</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our energy and services and other businesses. Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach. First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&amp;D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&amp;D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter. We recognized \u2013 we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with Megapack. As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon\u2019s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near term. Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook. Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>A - Martin Viecha </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much, Zach. And let\u2019s go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD we\u2019ve already answered. So, let\u2019s go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of 4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. First, I\u2019ll just start with a little bit of a production update. So, in Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here in Texas. So, congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Here in Texas, we\u2019re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We\u2019re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla\u2019s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We can\u2019t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update. Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target \u2013 vehicle target margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we\u2019ll tour today, actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla\u2019s dispatch next year. In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it\u2019s a relatively small contributor to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It\u2019s important to remember that these large projects \u2013 these large capital projects have lifetimes of 20 years of recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 million Powerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower our median customer\u2019s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expands market access. And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access that utilities, market operators and regulators permit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For Powerwall that\u2019s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, we provided previous guidance that we expect these to be for the course of this year in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that boundary as we guided previously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we\u2019ve mentioned this before, that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner, Panasonic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we\u2019ve discussed previously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the last call, because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before it actually is realized in our financials. And also just as a reminder, we\u2019re not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another \u2013 a bunch of other companies to put in place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it\u2019s about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there\u2019s two things to keep in mind there. The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it\u2019s important to adjust for that. And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased. And so, that\u2019s something to consider as you model out the impact on \u2013 from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I do want to ask Karn if there\u2019s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Karn Budhiraj</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. As you mentioned, Zach, we\u2019ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite. And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact. We\u2019re taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing and certainly [Indiscernible] to kind of extend some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade. So it\u2019s a playbook that we\u2019ll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question on FSD. Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. This is a question we get asked a lot. So, we\u2019re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a onetime amnesty. So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames. So yes, I hope this makes people happy. This is a onetime thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Demand is so far off the hook, you can\u2019t even see the hook. So, that\u2019s really not an issue. I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot. It doesn\u2019t look like -- it doesn\u2019t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain and internal production. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect -- I hope it\u2019s smooth. We\u2019re certainly better at production ramps that -- we\u2019ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps. But first order approximation, there\u2019s like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck. And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the 10,000. So, it\u2019s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we\u2019ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question is critics of Gigacasting contended that process makes vehicles harder and more costly to repair, essentially pushing costs on to the customer. Can you share some details about the initial repair experience with Gigacast vehicles?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That must be why everyone\u2019s copying us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lars Moravy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Elon. This is Lars. I mean, that\u2019s like simply not true. There\u2019s a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and multiple joining methods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and structural adhesives have to be chiseled out. Dried adhesive has to be removed, stains, cut, blah, blah, blah.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a crazy patch of a quilt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lars Moravy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And so putting that back together means time and money. Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the Model Y, to do that versus like what we replaced it with from Model 3, it\u2019s 10 times cheaper and 3 times faster to do it with the cast rail. Design team works with our collision repair team since we\u2019re a closed loop on this with insurance, and we design specific parts that make it easier and faster to repair. And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops. We expect that we\u2019ll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time. And we already make this available to all body shops or our Tesla-approved body shop training.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lars Moravy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Crucial. I don\u2019t think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have, so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts, and we actually do that all the time, so -- because the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway. So we can actually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings. But the cast --basically cast rear body or front body is lighter, cheaper, better noise vibration, harshness, much easier to manufacture. It\u2019s better in every way. And that\u2019s why so many other car companies are copying us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Lars Moravy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Probably.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, they certainly put out a lot of press releases about it. I think it\u2019s basically going to be how all cars are made in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Next question, how many Optimus bots have been made? And when will they be able to start performing useful tasks?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">10 million. Yes. I think we\u2019re around 5 or 6 bots. I think -- there\u2019s -- we were -- look, 10, I guess. Depends on what -- how many are working and what phase. But it\u2019s sort of -- yes, there\u2019s more every month. There\u2019s a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for humanoid robot at any price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly not compelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. There\u2019s not a humanoid robot that can do something -- the things that human could do. So, we\u2019ve actually had to design our own actuators that integrate the motor or the power electronics, the controller, the sensors. And really, every one of them is custom designed. And then, of course, we\u2019ll be using the same inference hardware as the car. But we are, in designing these actuators, designing them for volume production. So, they\u2019re not just lighter, tighter and more capable than any other actuators wherever that exists in the world, but it\u2019s also actually manufacturable. So, we should be able to make them in volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The first Optimus that is -- that will have all of the Tesla designed actuators, sort of production candidate actuators integrated and walking should be around November-ish. And then, we\u2019ll start ramping up after that. In terms of when we\u2019ll be able to do some useful things, like we\u2019ll first be trying this out in our own factories and just proving out its utility, but I think we\u2019ll be able to have it do something useful in our factories sometime next year. I would be -- yes, I\u2019m pretty confident of that. So yes, it\u2019s going well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I should say another cool thing about Optimus is that there\u2019s -- just in the U.S. alone, there are 2 million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team. And by combining a Neuralink implant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arm or leg or arms and legs amputated, we believe we can give basically a cyber body that is incredibly capable, $6 million man in real life, before don\u2019t want to cost $6 million. $60,000 man. This sounds impressive, but it will actually -- so that actually could be a really -- I think, would be incredible to potentially help people around the world and give them a robot arm or like that is as good, maybe long term better than a biological one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question is, how has the order intake trended relatively to production levels during Q2? And how has it trended in the quarter-to-date period? Conceptually, how does Tesla decide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or at other sales incentives to increase demand?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I guess, demand has roughly tracked production. So -- which is what we aim for is -- we look at -- it\u2019s something that we have that really -- I think no other carmaker has -- is that we have real-time demand and real-time production, like so seven days a week. I get an e-mail -- order generated e-mail, chose output from all factories and orders globally. So it\u2019s like a real-time finger on the pulse of earth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Buying a new car is a big decision for vast majority of people. So, any time there\u2019s economic uncertainty, people generally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens. And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car. And this is -- at least up until recently, it was, I believe, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. So, we had to do something about that. If somebody\u2019s got a crystal ball for the global economy, I really appreciate it, if I could borrow that crystal ball.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">DM us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, exactly, DM me. It should be not on Twitter. So, I mean, one day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart and the next day, everything is fine. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019d be totally fine. I wish I did. So, I mean that\u2019s why I say like I was on Twitter, I posted like just really advising because I care a lot about the sort of small shareholders, especially ones that have stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you, guys. And so, we can\u2019t control these macro shocks or the thematic depressive nature of the stock market. So, that\u2019s why I recommend against margin loans in times that are turbulent. If times are not that turbulent, actually margin loan can be a smart move within reason. But we\u2019re in, I would call it, turbulent times. Like I have very high confidence in the long-term value of Tesla. Like I see it -- I really see a path to a 10x -- call it a 5x increase in the value of the company, maybe a 10x. And -- but where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations and the mood of the markets, one cannot predict. And so, the old adage of buy and hold is right. For an investment advice, I\u2019d say like identifying a company as products you love. See if they -- does it seem like they\u2019ll continue to make good products or great products? Buy that stock and hold it. That\u2019s it. You\u2019ll win.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally great goods and services. They don\u2019t exist for any other reason. They shouldn\u2019t. So, that\u2019s why you should buy stock of a company that makes good products and has a great future pipeline. It\u2019s common sense, actually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then generally, if you see -- if you provide your confidence about what that company\u2019s products or services are, when the market panics, buy; and when the market is overly exuberant, you can sell. I\u2019m not recommending you to Tesla, but yes, buy low, sell high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Warren Buffett actually, I think has a saying -- I\u2019m paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like imagine living in your house and some crazy manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices at you, and it\u2019s a different price every day. But the house is still the same house. So, this is a stock market. Credit that to Warren Buffett.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Let\u2019s go to the next question. With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts? And if so, when?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Where\u2019s that crystal ball, again? If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture. Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly. I\u2019d recommend looking at ARK Invest. I think their analysis is very good. It\u2019s the best. And generally, Fintwit or the finance, Smart Finance people on Twitter, follow their accounts. They\u2019re great. So that\u2019s in my opinion where you\u2019ll get the best info. So, I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment. And don\u2019t sweat when things go up and down. In fact, if the market panics, buy; if the market is a little too exuberant, sell at the time. But just generally, like -- I feel -- I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll deliver over long term, but can\u2019t control short term. So -- and the autonomy is really where it\u2019s at. I mean, Zachary?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I fully agree with you. I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we generating enough money to continue to invest. And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense. It\u2019s intense in terms of investment; it\u2019s intense in terms of potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Frankly, I think it\u2019s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology. That is super hard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And vertical integration. It\u2019s not even just like new products, but also...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. We actually make our share...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest. That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction. Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest? Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and with -- a set of that we\u2019ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest the cash. This is what we\u2019re focused on. And so, there\u2019s a set of this that we control. We have a pipeline of cost reductions. We are getting tailwinds in the commodity space right now, as Karn mentioned, that\u2019s helpful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Variability around average selling prices goes back to Elon\u2019s point. We don\u2019t control interest rates. We don\u2019t control macro consumer sentiment. But we have an obligation to be responsive to that to ensure that we\u2019re matching supply and demand and keeping things balanced. And so, this is how we\u2019re managing the next handful of quarters. Soon enough, these quarters will be behind us. They won\u2019t be part of the present value of future cash flows of the business. And so, we want to make sure we keep that view and make sure that the long term business is exactly the way that we want it to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you very much. Now let\u2019s go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dan Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to start first with a question about your efforts in AI and Dojo. It\u2019s pretty clear it sounds like you\u2019re accelerating your focus. Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what the process is of refining a product? Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense of when the payout starts to -- when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is, what should we expect on the OpEx front as a result of this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sorry. Are you saying how much are we going to spend on Dojo or\u2026?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dan Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">R&amp;D on Dojo?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dan Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, we\u2019re not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditures. So -- but I mean, I think we will be spending something north of $1 billion over the next year on -- through the next year, it\u2019s well over $1 billion in Dojo. And yes, so I mean we\u2019ve got a truly staggering amount of video data to do training on. And this is another thing -- in order to copy us, you also need to spend billions of dollars on training compute. I mean, it\u2019s like -- and it\u2019s also hard to -- you need the data and you need the training computer. It\u2019s like -- think, well, things needed to actually achieve this at scale toward generalized solution for autonomy, it\u2019s -- this is one of the highest problems ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. I would say if they\u2019re so great, why can\u2019t they make a self-driving car? Because it\u2019s harder. That\u2019s why. So -- but I do think -- I think there\u2019s some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we\u2019ve got to process, it\u2019s got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So that\u2019s what Dojo is designed to do is optimize for video training. It\u2019s not optimized for LLMs. It\u2019s optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, so -- whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that\u2019s it. I mean -- but like I said, we\u2019re also -- we have some -- we\u2019re using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We\u2019ll continue to -- we\u2019ll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They\u2019ve done an incredible job.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And frankly, I don\u2019t know if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can\u2019t. So they\u2019ve got so many customers. They\u2019ve been kind enough to nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we\u2019re not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe 100 times better than human.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right now, I believe there\u2019s something on the order of 1 million automotive deaths per year. And then if you say permanent serious injuries, I think it\u2019s probably closer to 10 million per year. And -- so it matters if you\u2019re twice as good as human, 10 times -- like 10 times better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and 1 million severe permanent injuries. So, it\u2019s like, okay, we would rather be 100 times better. So there\u2019s really -- it\u2019s a march of 9s, and we want to achieve as perfect safety as possible. And that\u2019s truly mind-boggling amounts of video and computer needed for that. And then, I do think there\u2019s other applications for Dojo, but we just desperately need it for video training.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just to add to what Elon mentioned. So, the numbers that he mentioned are between R&amp;D spend and capital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so, we provide a three-year outlook on our capital expense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we\u2019ll continue to update our guidance in the Q.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I want to say, the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training. That\u2019s -- if we had more training compute, we would get it done faster. So that\u2019s it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And it\u2019s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dan Levy</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there\u2019s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you\u2019re sticking with your near term, your volume target of 50% CAGR. As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution. There\u2019s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not about getting more share. It\u2019s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today. Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week. If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that\u2019s 10 hours a week-ish. If you\u2019ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others. Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house. The value is just tremendous.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think it\u2019s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Let\u2019s go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Emmanuel Rosner</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you\u2019re improving FSD incrementally. What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reason I\u2019ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we\u2019ll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up. And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing. But then because it\u2019s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we\u2019ll be better than human by the end of this year. That\u2019s not to say we\u2019re approved by regulators. And I\u2019m saying that would be in the U.S. because we\u2019ve got to focus on one market first. But I think we\u2019ll be better than human by the end of this year. I\u2019ve been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the price of FSD -- so the great thing is the price of FSD is actually very low, it\u2019s not high. When you go back to what I said earlier, the value of the car increases dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 is actually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- and we -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription, although most people don\u2019t know that. So, I\u2019d recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don\u2019t have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I think yes, yes -- obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price for FSD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">William Stein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019d like to ask about -- to stick on this AI topic. We\u2019ve read with great interest the developments in Dojo today, and you\u2019ve spoken about FSD, but you\u2019ve also -- Elon, you started this x.ai company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI features and products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is the focus. So can you talk about how x.ai might overlap, might perhaps compete with Tesla or in other ways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think it\u2019ll actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world\u2019s best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So, it was like -- that\u2019s actually how it got started. I was interviewing a few people and they\u2019re like, no, we want to do a startup. I was like, and that\u2019s well -- I couldn\u2019t convince them to join Tesla. So -- so it\u2019s like, okay, well, better to start up that I run than go work somewhere else. That\u2019s kind of the genesis of xAI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And xAI is focused on sort of AGI. Yes. So it\u2019s -- like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings to Tesla. Also some of the best -- for the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interesting problem. So if you take, say, a material science group, really what convinced Charlie Colman to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at -- in both -- where we think is the best material science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla and SpaceX. He wasn\u2019t willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he\u2019s willing to do it if it is Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent in the world if that\u2019s the kind of thing you need to do. And that actually has been very beneficial to Tesla.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">William Stein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I could squeeze one more mundane question in. I wonder if you think you can hit the 1.8 million unit number with current pricing, or do you anticipate needing to continue to lower prices because it seems like they\u2019ve stabilized. The trends have stabilized in the last maybe 1.5 months. Should we expect sort of continued decreases or more stabilization for the rest of the year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. We have sort of -- we started the referral program, which I think will be quite effective. As Zach was saying earlier, we don\u2019t control the macroeconomic conditions. So, if interest rates continue to rise, that reduces the affordability of cars. And for a lot of people, they\u2019re really -- they\u2019re just really breaking even every month. In fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are, in fact, not breaking even every month. Credit card debt is looking scary. So, we just don\u2019t control the market conditions. If market condition is stable, I think prices will be stable. If they\u2019re not stable, then we would have lower prices. Yes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Let\u2019s go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Rusch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you\u2019re building out Dojo and implementing what truly is going to be a highly complex set of software, can you speak to the maturity of the operating system and how much outsourced software you\u2019re expecting to use in that system?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is a custom software stack, so. But it is designed such that you can run at a high level, PyTorch and JAX. But then we have to customize it to actually run on a custom silicon. So, the software stack is a combination of open source software and then Tesla software all the way to the bare silicon, which is the case for the inference computer in the car.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Colin Rusch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks so much. That\u2019s super helpful. And then can you speak to how you\u2019re managing some of the geopolitical risks relative to your capacity expansion? Obviously, as you guys continue to grow at this rate, you\u2019re going to be putting some folks out of business. And there\u2019s going to be some impacts around regional economy. So, I just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that in terms of some of your CapEx plans and how you\u2019re managing some of those relationships with different countries and regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, this is a period of unusual geopolitical risk. So, I think we\u2019re -- the best we can do is have factories in many parts of the world such that if things get difficult in one part of the world, we can still keep things going in the rest of the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Delaney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an update on when you think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehicle level? And what are the key puts and takes to get there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There\u2019s a series of costs that we manage, the series of costs which we don\u2019t control. And so particularly on the commodity side, where labor costs go, et cetera, it\u2019s just hard to say.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year. And now -- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we\u2019re seeing what seems to be deflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn\u2019t pressure. But we\u2019re seeing commodity prices dropping as was mentioned, as Karn mentioned a moment ago. I mean, I don\u2019t know, what do you think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Karn Budhiraj</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Definitely. There\u2019s that. And then there\u2019s also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That\u2019s the other thing we\u2019re seeing. As we\u2019re becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, the economies of scale come into play. There\u2019s equipment depreciation that comes into play, equipment that was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago. That used to be a part of the piece price. That\u2019s completely amortized. So, we\u2019ll see situation where piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to get better at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Of course, the commodities spiked up and down. Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I\u2019m totally agreeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And they\u2019re recovering now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Karn Budhiraj</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Cobalt -- the way it used to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And we\u2019re still early in the ramp -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost down curve of Austin and Berlin. And so, it takes time to work the cost out it. First, it\u2019s a focus on ramp -- ramp, it brings cost down...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And quality costs\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And then once that stabilizes, we can divert bandwidth to cost reduction. And so Austin and Berlin saw quite a decent amount of cost reduction on a fundamental basis from Q1 to Q2. We\u2019ll continue to do that work that will be helpful. And so we\u2019re just going to keep chipping away at it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Packaging is a big element to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, logistics\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Logistics is normalizing, which is great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Indiscernible] utilization, something that the team has been very focused on. So, every bit of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, and it\u2019s hard...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Logistics is underappreciated. Yes, so sold saying goes like valves and with tactics as one with logistics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And we\u2019ve made tremendous improvements in cost in all fronts on expired costs. We have done pre-pandemic expired cost levels now, and our goal is to go further down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. So when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, the way that we look at internally, normalized for the impacts of mix shift with Austin and Berlin being a higher percentage of our mix, normalized for S and X being a higher percentage of our mix in Q2 versus Q1, the sequential cost reduction, it might be the largest we\u2019ve had in a while. So, I think it\u2019s great work on behalf of the Tesla team, and we just got to keep it up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, it\u2019s a game of pennies. It\u2019s a Game of Thrones with pennies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Martin Viecha</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mark, do you have a follow-up question? I think you\u2019re muted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mark Delaney</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thank you very much for all the details on that. Maybe you could put a finer point on the downtime impact that you spoke about in your prepared comments in terms of production impact and then also to what extent there\u2019s a margin impact from those factory upgrades that you\u2019re planning this quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Zachary Kirkhorn</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. The downtime -- we don\u2019t know exactly the number of cars impacted because kind of the way that we go into downtime windows for upgrades is we set aside a period of time, but then the team is challenged to go as quickly as possible so that we can get the factories up and running again and minimize that. It\u2019s not profound reduction. Hopefully, it\u2019s small.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Elon Musk</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019re getting too much into the weeds here. I mean, like we\u2019re asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer. So, let\u2019s move on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Martin Viecha</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today. So, we\u2019ll speak to you all in the next three months. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.</p>", "twitContent": "$TSLA - Tesla, Inc.
