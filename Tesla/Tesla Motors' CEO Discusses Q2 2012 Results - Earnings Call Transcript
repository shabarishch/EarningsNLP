[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Evanson, head of investor relations. Sir, you may begin.</p> <p><strong>Jeff Evanson</strong></p> <p>Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the Tesla Motors second quarter 2012 financial results Q&amp;A conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chairman, CEO, and chief product architect, and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla\u2019s chief financial officer.</p> <p>We announced our financial results for the second quarter shortly after 1 p.m. Pacific time today. The shareholder letter, financial results, and webcast of this Q&amp;A are all available at the company\u2019s investor relations website at ir.teslamotors.com.</p> <p>Today\u2019s call is for your questions. We will conduct the Q&amp;A session live, so please press *1 now if you would like to ask a question. During the course of this call, we may discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Such statements are predictions based on management\u2019s current expectations. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Such forward-looking statements represent our views as of today, and should not be relied upon after today. We also disclaim any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Now, operator, could we please have our first question? </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Our first question<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> comes from John Lovallo from Merrill Lynch. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few questions for you here. Starting with developmental services revenue, was that $5 million in the quarter all Daimler revenue? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, it is all Daimler revenue. You\u2019re right about that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And would you say that that $5 million would be a good run rate over the next six quarters? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s going to vary by quarter, because our overall program with Daimler is based on delivery of certain milestones, and there are different revenues associated with it. We have indicated that it\u2019s going to be total close to $30 million and it will be spread over the next six quarters roughly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of model S deliveries in the quarter, did you guys disclose how many were actually delivered? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We delivered in the quarter 10 model S. We produced a few more, and our focus was primarily providing those for our marketing activities, so that we could have more ride and drive events, the Get Amped tour that we kicked off. So we really wanted to make sure we had a lot going on for our test drives. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if I could probably preempt a question that if you weren\u2019t going to ask it, somebody probably would. We\u2019ve made a total of 40 production vehicles so far. And the production is ramping quite well actually, so it actually steps up in a sort of geometric or exponential fashion. It\u2019s not linear. So we\u2019ll see quite a dramatic increase in the production rate in the coming months. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the power train units for Toyota, how many units were actually produced this quarter? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We produced roughly 100 units in this quarter. And it\u2019s a combination of battery packs and drive units, but it was in that ballpark. It\u2019s, again, a start of the ramp in terms of our production, as we\u2019ve indicated. And we\u2019ll continue to see some growth there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Lovallo - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How many roadster vehicles actually remain to be sold throughout the remainder of the year? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have about 130-140 vehicles left to sell, and we expect to have those sold out by the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Dan Galves from Deutsche Bank </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Galves \u2013 Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the ramp - and congratulations on launching the vehicle on time and the great reviews it\u2019s been getting - wondering if you could talk about what are the key challenges to come in terms of making this exponential jump in production rate at some point in the quarter, whether you\u2019re making last minute tweaks in the vehicle, or supplier issues, or the process at Fremont. If you could just kind of take us through what the challenges are ahead in that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First of all, it\u2019s worth learning that it is actually normal in the auto industry for there to be an exponential growth in production. So this is not unusual. Ours is maybe going over a slightly longer potential than is normally the case for gasoline cars, because in our case we\u2019ve got probably something like 97-98% of the components of the Model S are new. They\u2019re not in any other vehicle. And you can only make cars as fast as your slowest component. And we want to make very sure that every car that comes off the line is as close to perfect as possible. In fact, I\u2019m personally inspecting every car whenever I can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it makes sense to take that approach and ensure that when customers receive a car it is as close to flawless as possible, and only grow the production ramp to the degree we\u2019re able to maintain an exceptional quality standard rather than to sort of rush into things and then have a great deal of customer unhappiness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And when we looked at our cash flow forecasts, whether we did a bunch more deliveries in the third quarter or basically if we moved several hundred deliveries from third quarter, one way or the other, it doesn\u2019t change our cash low point. And we are optimizing for our cash low point, from a cash flow standpoint. And then on the other side, making sure that our customers are ecstatic when they get their cars. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so I actually changed the production ramp to slow it down at the beginning and then ramp it up faster toward the end. And I think it\u2019s the right decision. Time will tell, but I think it\u2019s the sensible decision. It certainly what I would wish somebody did if I was a shareholder in the company, and I am. [laughter] </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Galves \u2013 Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that makes sense. And just to follow up on your comments on the cash flow, it looks like liquidity went down by $120 million approximately in the quarter. You have $265 million of liquidity available. It seems like the cash low point - I guess I don\u2019t understand what you mean by the cash low point doesn\u2019t change. It would seem like the longer it takes until you get to the higher production rate, the lower your cash balances would go. So if there\u2019s any way to kind of gauge whether the cash burn will slow in the third quarter and if you have a targeted year end level that you could provide to us, that would be helpful. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Dan, I think if this is a managed slowdown, then you can manage cash, and that\u2019s what we have done. We\u2019ve deliberately, up front, planned to do 500 units. The worst thing you can do is plan for 1,000 and then deliver 500. That\u2019s when you have the excess cash burn. So this is a planned approach, which helps us manage our cash. And as we\u2019ve indicated in the shareholder letter, our expectation based on our plans is that we will achieve pretty close to free cash flow breakeven in Q4. And in Q3, we will see a burn roughly along the same lines as Q2, maybe slightly higher. But considering all of that, and given our cash resources, we feel pretty comfortable that we have sufficient liquidity to get to profitability next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you move several hundred cars from one quarter to the next, it actually does not change our cash low point. That\u2019s actually driven more by working capital requirements at the end of the year, when we\u2019re producing almost a couple thousand cars a month. So why try to push a product on customers that is not as perfect as possible if it doesn\u2019t actually yield anything tangible? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Dan Galves \u2013 Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It seems like, different than most auto makers, you recognize revenue when the vehicle is delivered to the customer, not when it\u2019s shipped off the factory to a dealer. So I guess what I\u2019m getting at is you probably, if you\u2019re going to deliver 500 in the third quarter, you\u2019re probably going to produce quite a bit more than that? Is that true? And then where do you expect inventory to be once you get to close to your targeted run rate of 5,000 a quarter? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s probable that we\u2019ll produce more than 500, but it\u2019s always a little tricky to - essentially, if you imagine the production ramp is this quite sharp S curve, and as you pick an arbitrary point on a steep portion of that S curve, you can actually see quite significant movement of units. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly where things will be on that steep portion of the S curve. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s relevant, because you get to the flat portion, but at the high portion of the S curve, at that point it\u2019s much more predictable, and that\u2019s sort of a point we feel really confident about getting to in the fourth quarter. And I think it\u2019s the more relevant thing. Like, if you were to present value the cash flows, and move the stuff around, it actually doesn\u2019t change the effect of the market cap of the company if one is doing the analysis correctly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think it\u2019s probable we\u2019ll do that, but it\u2019s not certain. But one way or the other, it\u2019s not going to make much of a difference. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Dan, to your specific question, although we recognize the revenue when the customer gets the car, the gap is not much. At least in the beginning. A lot of our customers are in California. Deliveries happen immediately. And even if it is long distance, it\u2019s just a matter of a couple more days, or three days. It\u2019s not that dramatically different.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And one thing I wanted to reemphasize, if people recall, one of the things that I\u2019ve been really emphatic about is that in 2013 we\u2019ll produce at least 20,000 units, and that our gross margin will exceed 25%. And I also said that we\u2019d start deliveries no later than July. And those are the three things that I said I was highly confident that we would do. There are other things that are sort of nice-to-haves, and you\u2019d like to do, and maybe this will happen, but those are the important ones. And it\u2019s worth noting that we started deliveries in June, so we\u2019re ahead of July. And I think we\u2019re going to exceed 20,000 units next year and exceed 25% gross margin. And those are the things that I think you should really hold me and Tesla to. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s the flat portion of that S curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s the thing that really matters, yes. Absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Ben Schuman from Pacific Crest Securities. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Schuman \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Elon, you talked about changing the ramp a little bit. Can you specifically address what is driving that in terms of the quality control factors that you\u2019re focusing on with that revised timeline? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I can talk a little bit about it, although it\u2019s easy to get lost in the weeds. Because it\u2019s not as though there\u2019s any one big thing. It\u2019s like a couple hundred little knick-nacky things. One example is the supplier who\u2019s doing the chrome plating of the door handles just couldn\u2019t meet our quality standards. There were little tiny pits in the plating that were just unacceptable to us. So we had to switch that to a different plating supplier. Things like the banana leaf interior trim, when I was shown a sample of that, it looked good, but when I saw it on the car, it did not look good, so I canned it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re not going to deliver an option that doesn\u2019t look good, and unfortunately that was not clear until we saw it in a car, which was late in the game. So there\u2019s some sort of things like that. We have to do last-minute maneuvering. But decisions are made absolutely with respect to ensuring that the product is the best possible product. That\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming at. Great companies are just built around great products or services, and so we have to be super-focused on ensuring that we have a product that is not slightly better, but substantially better. And I think we have that actually. The reviews, that\u2019s the response we\u2019re getting. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Schuman \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you address how cancellations are trending now that more and more of those finalize your order emails are going out? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think overall we\u2019re finding that cancellations as a percentage of our reservations is holding fairly steady the last few months. So clearly customers have to make that decision, but we\u2019re not seeing anything which raises any red flags in our minds. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Quite frankly, the thing that I get bugged about is not cancellations, it\u2019s people who want their car sooner. A day does not go by when I don\u2019t get several requests from quite senior people, or celebrities, saying isn\u2019t there some way they could move up on the list. It\u2019s not the cancellations that are a concern. We do not have a demand problem. We obviously do not have a demand problem. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One of the biggest reasons people do not put down a reservation payment for a Model S is because you have to wait a year almost, or 10-11 months. And if you need a car, you need a car. So we actually need to focus our energies heavily on the production ramp and maintaining quality, and achieving gross margin. Those are really our issues. It\u2019s not demand generation. George is doing such an awesome job, I don\u2019t even have to worry about that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Schuman \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve seen some concept cars from other manufacturers, high performance EVs, things like that, but nothing really close to production that compares to the Model S in terms of performance characteristics, things like that. Who do you think from a competitive standpoint is closest to Tesla, especially on the power train side of things, and how far behind are they? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the next best power trains are the ones that we provide to our partners. Then, after that, then you\u2019re at the Leaf, I suppose, which obviously has some range issues and is not sort of a fun car to drive. I actually think that Nissan should double down on their electric vehicle investment and just need to improve the product. It\u2019s not where it needs to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the way to think of the Model S is really not from the standpoint of how does it compare to other electric cars. That\u2019s not really why people are buying our car. They\u2019re buying our car because it\u2019s the best car. When you look at the characteristics of the vehicle, whether it\u2019s aesthetics, safety, handling, performance, the user interface and the functionality and the technology in the car, fit and finish. All those things I mentioned, against which you would evaluate the car\u2019s product, including taking all those characteristics and integrating them into a Gestalt and saying does this, as an integrated system, work? Because sometimes you have a mixture of ingredients that don\u2019t come together into a good product. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Really, people are buying our car because they think it\u2019s better than buying any other car in that price range. They\u2019re selecting against cars in that price range, not electric cars. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m going to go back to the point about the Model S S curve ramp from Q3 to Q4. So you\u2019re at 10 cars a week now. I guess you\u2019ll be averaging just over 40 a week in Q3. And then to ramp to an average of 375 a week in Q4 to kind of make the 5,000 full year number. So I totally take on board your point about the shape of the S curve, and it\u2019s more like a switch than a ramp, if I\u2019m not mistaken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But in order to make sense of this, I think, that vertical portion of the S curve would have to happen not only pretty quickly but really very early in the fourth quarter. Or else you\u2019d be implying an exit rate that would be way, way over 375 a week, which would be implying, I guess - maybe this is what you\u2019re implying - that you\u2019d be doing way over a full-year clip of 20,000 a year. So is there any other way you can kind of give us an idea - and if you can\u2019t, I understand - what your exit rate might be in the third quarter, or your entry rate in the fourth? Or am I right to be thinking that in order to do your 5,000, that geometric switch has to be pretty damn early in Q4? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think you\u2019re essentially right about counts. We will be at a higher production rate than 20,000 a year at the end of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Would that, then, level off? Is that something that would be sustained in like a horizontal portion of that curve? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That depends on how demand is looking. If demand is looking good, why level off? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I agree 100%. So that is part of the implication, is that it makes the 20,000 next year - with that \u201cat least,\u201d you\u2019re emphasizing that with what you\u2019re implying. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yep. When I say \u201cat least\u201d I mean higher. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, you don\u2019t mean 20,001. Understood. And then my last question is given the enormous interest in the Model S, and also the very strong interest in the Model X, and what looks like the opportunity to launch the Gen III - at least according to some comments Franz made - maybe as early as 2015, earlier than many expected, this might accelerate some of your capital needs to give these products their full resources. So you throw in some uncertain economic conditions and can you see the rationale for potentially raising a bit more equity capital as sort of an insurance policy to make sure all this hard work and great work and momentum isn\u2019t necessarily put at too much risk due to events outside of the company\u2019s control? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. Actually, I think that there is arguably some merit to raising incremental funding just to protect against an unforeseen event. I do want to emphasize that our cash flow projections require no funding raise at all. If we do not raise any funding, we can reach cash flow positive with decent margin. That\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t some merit in raising a little bit funding maybe, just to increase the cushion. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re debating internally, and something that we may do. But I do want to emphasize it\u2019s not something we have to do. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. So it\u2019s a cushion, it would be for risk management, and more opportunistic, to kind of fuel even greater growth opportunity. Is that how you\u2019d pitch it? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, exactly. And in order for us to not raise any funding, we would probably spend at a suboptimal rate on future programs. I believe we\u2019d want to spend at the optimal rate. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Would you say that it would be more the early feedback and opportunity on the Model X that would potentially drive that opportunity? Or is it the timing and opportunity on the Gen III? Or is it a bit of both, or all of the above? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, the only two things we\u2019re considering are raising zero money or a small amount. There\u2019s not some third option. Then if we raised a small amount of money, it would be probably half of it for cushion value and then half of it for future projects which would be the Model X and the Gen III. We\u2019ve got to come up with a better name than Gen III by the way. [laughter] </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Carter Driscoll from Capstone Investments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do you imagine you will disclose the ramp - maybe, say, throughout the third quarter - so we can get comfortable that you\u2019re going to be at that 375 pace in the fourth quarter? How do you expect to communicate with the Street that you\u2019re progressing along the lines that you\u2019re hoping for? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019ll continue to have investor visits here. And clearly, as deliveries progress, you will get a sense of it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There will be cars on the road. That will be a huge clue. [laughter] </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ll definitely make sure over time we are communicating how things are progressing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think actually people could track it by figuring out what serial number car has just been delivered. And there you go. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you talk about your fast charging initiative and any developments there? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re finishing up some construction activity on that. It\u2019s looking like probably a September event, but that\u2019s contingent on finishing some construction and getting all the permits and whatnot for the [super] chargers. But I\u2019m really excited about that announcement. I think it\u2019s way cooler than anyone realizes. I think it\u2019s going to have a profound effect on how the public sees electric vehicles. There\u2019s going to be a few surprises there. Almost no one knows the full story. There will be some cool things there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Could you talk about the warranty? There\u2019s been a lot of discussion. I myself have had discussions with some of your sales people. And I don\u2019t think people fully understand the warranty side for battery versus the vehicle itself. Could you just remind everyone what the battery and the vehicle warranty contains right now? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. For the battery warranty, it essentially merges language that Nissan was using, and I think maybe the Volt is also using similar language. Which is to say that the battery is warrantied for eight years, and the amount of miles you can really put on it. Actually, depending on which version - it\u2019s unlimited for the 300-mile range version. Unless you torture yourself, you won\u2019t be able to put enough miles on that to matter. So for the 160-mile version, you\u2019d really have to be doing a lot of traveling within the city to do 100,000 miles in eight years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of where the pack energy level will be at that point, it\u2019s going to vary depending on what sort environment the pack is experiencing and what sort of driver the person has been, in much the same way as an engine, after eight years, is going to depend on whether someone was driving it hard or not, and what sort of environment it saw. It will still be a very usable pack. And we\u2019re expecting the packs actually have a useful life that\u2019s somewhere around double the warranty level. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">People will probably want to replace it sooner than that, but these really last for a long time. Even our first generation pack on the Roadster, one customer in Europe just passed the 200,000 km mark, and he\u2019s not someone who drives the car slowly. In fact, he passed the 200,000 km mark in a race. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That kind of leads to my next question. It\u2019s the relationship you have with Wells. And because of what you just stated, you believe the battery pack\u2019s going to last twice what it\u2019s currently warrantied for, I\u2019m assuming that the residual value of that price point, given there just aren\u2019t a whole lot of comparable vehicles to be able to set what the residual value is going to be, and therefore the leasing terms. But you feel comfortable that\u2019s not a sticking point, as you suddenly saw people wanting to lease the vehicle, even though you don\u2019t expect that to be the case for probably 12-18 months at the minimum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right. We don\u2019t need to lease a single car until maybe the second half of next year at the soonest. We could just be all sales. But we have had many discussions about residual value. The thing that supports residual value is just to make sure that the depreciation of the battery pack essentially matches that of the rest of the car. And if you had a gasoline car, after 10 years, it\u2019s on the order of 10-15% of its original value. So it\u2019s depreciated down to almost nothing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do you expect that to be comparable? Or do you expect residual value to be higher? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I actually think it will be higher. Because the other thing is once you put a new pack into the car, it will actually be better than new from a range standpoint. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Because you continue to recognize the savings versus fueling your car with gas for the next 10 years, or whatever. So you get huge benefits of that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gasoline\u2019s probably not getting cheaper in the long run. I mean, the price of gasoline is an upward sloping sine wave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I agree with that. Have you guys actually booked any warranty expense in anticipation of having to replace any of the batteries? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, with each car there\u2019s a warranty reserve. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re booking a warranty reserve for each of the cars, and that\u2019s related to the entire vehicle, not just to the battery. And just to clarify your other point, with Wells Fargo, we\u2019re not offering lease financing. It\u2019s traditional retail financing. So residual values or leasing is not really an issue in our present offering with Wells Fargo. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With Athlon it is. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Athlon is offering their own lease program in Europe for corporate clients. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we did sign our first Model S leasing deal in Europe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Have you seen the mix of reservations change as 2012 has unfolded? Are you still seeing a similar rate of the signature series versus the other range models? Or has that stayed fairly consistent? Can you talk about your expectations about how that may change over time as well? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s fortunate that the signature series has been sold out for several months now. Not only is the signature series is sold out, we have a long waiting list for people to get on [unintelligible], and arguments about what place they are on the wait list. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[You were sold out in year two.]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re sold out in the EU on the signature series as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So basically, all the reservations that we are getting now are for general production and our customers, when they make a reservation, are basically just getting into the queue for a car. They\u2019re not locking in which battery pack size they\u2019re getting. So that we will find out over time when they start to lock in their specific order. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is tending to be on the higher end than we expected, I think. That could change. It\u2019s hard to say, as you can see, whether it\u2019s general production, whether people are going to go to cars with fewer options. But certainly the trend has been that they\u2019re picking more options than we expected. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Carter Driscoll \u2013 Capstone Investments</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was just trying to get at, you know, given that you have a fairly significant amount of your cash in reservation payments, just trying to understand how that mix has potentially shifted over time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just touching on the production ramp a bit more, Elon, just want to clarify, in the past you had said really that 20,000 production line is really focused on sort of one shift operating at one point in time. What type of flexibility do you have to either add additional personnel, overtime, or anything along those lines, in order to meet your production targets? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s almost entirely on one shift. There are a few areas where we had some cap intensive equipment, where it\u2019s on two shifts. But that\u2019s easily addressed to expand volume. I think in principle we could comfortably have a production rate next year that\u2019s 50% greater than 20,000. I hesitate to predict when in the year we\u2019d be sort of confidently maintaining that at a steady pace. Look at it this way, at the end of next year, I think that there\u2019s a pretty good likelihood that we\u2019re at least at the 30,000 unit a year run rate at the end of next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think maybe more generally we have flexibility. And the flexibility allows us to do a lot of things. That\u2019s overtime, add a second shift. We can do a lot. So I think whatever the targets, it will be what they are, and depending on demand, we have that flexibility. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s not totally willy nilly. You do need to hire a second shift. You need to get them trained, and you need to make sure you maintain the quality on the second shift. You don\u2019t want to have cars that are made on the second shift that are worse than cars made on the first shift. So it doesn\u2019t require a significant capital injection - minuscule capital injection to increase the rate, which is great. So there\u2019s certainly upside to opportunity there. But I don\u2019t want to trivialize how easy it is to find good people and get them trained and make sure everything\u2019s good and you don\u2019t have, like, the B team on the second shift. That\u2019s very important. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then if we\u2019re thinking about the demands on your cash for the near term. I was wondering when do you expect to start paying back the DOE loan? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We start paying that back in December of this year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re required to pay it back in December. We\u2019ll start paying it back no later than December. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then there\u2019s quarterly payments thereafter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in terms of the demands on your cash, that\u2019s factored into your expectations for where you will end fourth quarter cash in terms of a relatively okay position? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly, if I may, we\u2019ve certainly seen a number of new stores open up in terms of building retail points for you folks as well as building brand awareness. How should we think about the trajectory for opex over the course of perhaps this year and the duration of 2013? What\u2019s the plan at this point? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think as we indicated in the shareholder letter, certainly R&amp;D expense will drop as a lot of those costs move into cost of goods sold. And on the SG&amp;A side, as we open stores, and there is an acceleration there, we will see a moderate increase in our sales expenses. I would say in the 10-15% range or so, as we are adding more stores. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The stores are really kicking butt. George, is there any color you\u2019d like to add to the stores? We just opened the Third Street Promenade store on Santa Monica Boulevard, if people are in the L.A. area and want to get a sense for the latest in Tesla store technology. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think our goal with the stores the rest of this year is to try to address some new markets. One of the markets that we really haven\u2019t solidified up until now is that Northeast corridor. And our goal is to open several new stores in that corridor in order to hit one of the most densely populated areas of the country and try to do it in sort of an accelerated way. Because we think there\u2019s lots and lots of potential up there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what\u2019s really nice is we already have an embedded number of people there. I mean, the beauty of our model is that we already know where the first 12,000 cars are going. We know where customers who are interested in us live. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we can use that data to open up stores, because if there\u2019s certain people there who are already, with very little effort, already reserving our car. Think what happens if we actually do put some effort in there. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing this year is we\u2019re hitting the hottest spots where we have really strong demand already in order to leverage that and that word of mouth from customer to customer. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the people who have already gotten their car, they\u2019re like kids in a candy store with their car. They can\u2019t wait to drive it. They can\u2019t wait to take people to dinner. They can\u2019t wait to take people out. So when we put more stores in and amongst where those people are and they have a place to gather and share stories and stuff. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with the store growth this year. We\u2019re focusing on places where we know there\u2019s existing demand in order to leverage it more. A lot in the Northeast. We\u2019re going to open another one down in Miami Beach. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And the traffic through the stores has been incredible. I think you probably saw in the shareholder letter that year to date we\u2019ve had over a million people go through the newly designed stores in North America. I mean, that\u2019s an incredible number. And they keep bringing more people, more friends and stuff like that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the stores are really performing well, and I think by going after the Northeast corridor, we will subsequently make a difference by year end. I have a goal this year that in the month of December we could have a million people go through our stores in one month. It\u2019s that crazy of a number. So that\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re shooting for. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Tesla is not a demand constrained company. [laughter] We\u2019re production constrained. So that must be our focus. But not at the expense of quality. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just had, unfortunately, a couple more questions on the ramp. I was wondering whether we could get just a little bit more color on sort of how that process is going to work. It sounds like from what you\u2019ve said already so far that one of the things you\u2019re sort of hitting to get to the next stage is really having to lock down decisions on certain components. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not really decisions. It\u2019s ensuring internal production quality and supplier quality. But we\u2019re not changing the product for change\u2019s sake. If there\u2019s a change, it\u2019s because we had to redesign to improve manufacturability in a few cases here and there. But we\u2019re not iterating on the product, the physical product. Of course, from a software standpoint, we will continue to provide updates, because in terms of [zoning] company that does wireless updating of the car\u2019s software and firmware. Customers get their car, and they\u2019ll find that new functionality and improvements have been uploaded overnight while the car was in their garage. So that will continue, but we are really on lockdown on any physical changes that aren\u2019t absolutely required. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I understand that the software piece can be sort of continuous, but it sounds like there are still some components that are being made with pre-production tooling by some of your suppliers, and I guess the process of getting those finalized and with the right fit and finish is what helps you kind of accelerate. Maybe you can just give a little bit of color. Is there kind of a percentage in terms of components of the car, where there\u2019s still some improvement to be made and a benchmark on that you might be able to sort of think about as a guidepost for when that acceleration will take place? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are several thousand parts in the car. Probably 97-98% of them are fine. There\u2019s a couple percent that needs to be addressed. But you cannot ship a car that is 98% complete, or where there\u2019s sort of 2% of the components are not of consistently high quality. So there\u2019s probably a couple dozen suppliers where we have some challenges, where we\u2019ve got to fix the supplier, bring it internal or get a different supplier. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">These are not big things. That\u2019s very important. Honestly, sometimes the most ridiculously silly things. Like it could be a piece of carpet or a bit of interior trim that doesn\u2019t have a flush condition or like there\u2019s a piece of bright molding on the dashboard which doesn\u2019t exactly follow where it has an intersection with another piece of bright molding. That intersection doesn\u2019t have the right press. So there are these little things that are extremely annoying. [laughter] But we just can\u2019t be delivering cars that don\u2019t have an outstanding fit and finish. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Of those sort of couple dozen parts, almost all of them are like interior soft trim issues. So it\u2019s not like there\u2019s some important fundamental technology thing. Like our battery pack and power train is in great shape. Chassis is in great shape, and body and paint. Obviously we want to keep refining it and make sure that the gaps and fits are as close to perfection as physics will allow, but obviously the vexing things are a bunch of seemingly trivial interior components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Perhaps though it\u2019s just because we assumed those things wouldn\u2019t be problematic, and they were more problematic than we realized. We\u2019ve since beefed up our interior trim engineering group considerably, and [unintelligible] in the future. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the shareholder letter, you also said that you\u2019d received all the dies. Maybe we can talk a little bit about that. Is everything pretty much approved now? And are you essentially at the stage where you\u2019re stamping all the components in house at the right specs? Or is there still some importing of components while you kind of fine tune some of these remaining dies? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re able to stamp everything in house at this point. We\u2019re still tweaking some of the gaps and how well things shut. We really want to set a new industry benchmark for the accuracy of body fit. We don\u2019t want to be second to anyone in this regard. And actually we\u2019re going to keep iterating on that to the limit of what is physically possible. And most people won\u2019t even notice these changes unless they have a very discerning eye. So stamping\u2019s not a problem. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe this is a flaw in my character, but I tend to be pretty perfectionist about these things, and the goal is that we want the car to be so accurate you could use it as a yardstick. You can use it as a calibration device. That\u2019s how I want the car to be. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo - Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going back to the capital raise question, Bloomberg is already reporting that you guys might do a small capital raise. Can you talk about price sensitivity since the stock\u2019s trading near where your last secondary was done, and you\u2019ve created significant value since then in the company? And also around timing, a lot of the questions here are focused on the ramp, so would you do a capital raise after that ramp was proved out? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s best we don\u2019t comment on any of these. I think as Elon said, we\u2019ll just opportunistically pursue at the right time, and I think that\u2019s probably the best way. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I\u2019d like to exclude the very near future. We will not be raising money in the very near future. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo - Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And can you give me any color on what that means? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. [laughter] I might get some color from the SEC if I gave you that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo - Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[laughter] Can you give us an update on the leasing program here in the United States? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think as Elon alluded to, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll look into next year. We\u2019re continuing to evaluate that, and I think at this point our focus is on the key priorities of production. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I can maybe just give my views on leasing long term, which is I\u2019m a huge proponent of leasing, particularly for electric vehicles. As is the case with solar, with SolarCity, leasing has proven to be extremely effective as a way to encourage solar adoption. And it sort of seems like it shouldn\u2019t be that effective, because if you told someone, hey, this system is going to pay you back in five years, and they said, oh, five years, that sounds like a long time. Like, do you know how long your savings account\u2019s going to take to pay you back? You\u2019ll be dead. [laughter] </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so people seem able to do the math on that. It\u2019s like, excluding compounding, a 20% return if it pays back in five years, and with certainty. Where do you get something like that? And yet amazingly, SolarCity had trouble getting people to act. So we\u2019re basically going to go to people that understand, people who are sophisticated in finance, and are looking for yield, and say, okay, let\u2019s go talk to people who really understand yield and take that problem away from the consumers so they don\u2019t have to think about it, and they can just look at it like their electricity cost went down. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Why is that relevant to Tesla? Because the cost of operation on the Model S is much less than the cost of operation of any other premium sedan, by far. It\u2019s going to feel like you have a car for free. And particularly in places like Europe. It\u2019s, like, $9-10 a gallon in Europe. You can spend a couple hundred dollars filling up your gas tank. Or you can spend some negligible amount recharging your car.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it really amounts to a huge effective discount on the cost of operation of the car relative to other premium sedans. But the best way to make that apparent is through a lease. So we\u2019re going to be very big on leasing in the future. We just haven\u2019t needed to do that because there\u2019s enough demand for the car where we just tell people you\u2019ve got to buy the whole thing. You can\u2019t have leasing. [laughter] If we have sufficient demand to do that, then we should turn our attention to the key thing, which is production, and then next year we\u2019ll get to leasing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we do have data from the Roadster that I think is helpful to leasing companies. And by the way, the Roadster\u2019s got really good residual value. I think it\u2019s significantly better than a Porsche, actually. Maybe it depends on which Porsche you consider, but it\u2019s certainly got much better residual value than the Porsche I bought about five years ago. [laughter] Thing\u2019s worth like a peanut. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ben Kallo - Robert W. Baird</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And my last one, on deliveries. Deepak, you mentioned that there isn\u2019t much risk around timing, around production, deliveries. Maybe if you could just expand upon that, how people are ready to accept their cars. And then also, is it safe for me to infer from your comments about the quality issues and getting to your target quality that you\u2019re not currently delivering? And then when do you expect to actually start delivering vehicles? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My comment earlier was especially in the early part, there\u2019s a bigger percentage of deliveries in California, which significantly reduces the gap between production and delivery. And as we go further out, there is going to be a few days, but it\u2019s not dramatically different from the traditional OEM model. That was my point. So hopefully that\u2019s clear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in terms of deliveries, we are making deliveries. We are also making a lot of cars for marketing and sales, even in Q3, so that we continue and show as many cars to our potential customers and folks who have made reservations that are locking in their cars. So it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re not making deliveries. We\u2019re just going slow on the ramp to sort out the issues before we go up the S curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jeff Evanson </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I just want to make a quick comment on timing here. We have about five minutes left for the scheduled call. We\u2019ll add another five minutes on top of that. So analysts, if you could please keep your questions short and management your answers brief, we\u2019ll get through as many as we can. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Sanjay Shrestha from Lazard Capital Markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you talk about how are reservations converting into the final order for you guys? And obviously, reservation numbers have been good, but what would you say is the final order number at this point in time? Do you have 500? 5,000? How should we think about that? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How many people have locked in their options? Is that what you mean? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Exactly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have 12,200 net reservations. George is saying we\u2019ve had about 1,000 people lock in. But we only asked them to lock in\u2026 </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few months. We haven\u2019t gone to all the folks. We\u2019ve only gone to a small percentage of people. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have invited the signature reservation holders in the U.S. only to configure. And then we went out about 10 days ago, give or take, to our first group of general production people, sending out the email saying it\u2019s time to build your Model S. And then this week we\u2019ll go out to the next tranche of general production U.S. And then we\u2019ll proceed from there to Canada signature, then Canada general production. So just to be clear here, we haven\u2019t gone out to 12,000 people and said, configure your car. We\u2019re doing it in sequential order based upon when they made their reservation. And as of today, we\u2019ll be about 1,000 fully configured cars that people have finalized their options and everything on. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Sanjay Shrestha - Lazard Capital Markets</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you\u2019re more than covering what you plan to ship in Q3. And then Q4 you think about that as you go. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, by far, yeah. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">By far. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Andrea James from Dougherty &amp; Company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just quickly on the ramp, obviously Elon when you chose to slow production in Q3 you had to make a decision to ramp even faster to make up for it in Q4. What preserved the previous step function? So what went into that decision, and why not push some of the 5,000 for this year into next year and build in some more contingency time? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I never made a hard commitment that we were to do 5,000 units this year. There was effectively a soft implication that we would do 5,000 units this year. The hard one was like the 20,000 next year and 25% gross margin and to start deliveries no later than July. Those are the three hard ones. The others stayed relatively soft. But I still want to aspire to meet something even if it\u2019s a softer commitment. And it\u2019s going to mean that we\u2019ll have to work pretty hard over Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year\u2019s and all that, but we want to try to do it for our investors. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then I hate to go here, but there\u2019s commentary on blogs and message boards. You have people with low reservation numbers saying, I\u2019m not told I\u2019m going to get my car until October or Q1. And I guess just what do you make of that commentary? I imagine some people on your team are looking at it as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sometimes things can go a little awry on message boards. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the message boards. I think sometimes people can get the wrong information and they can sort of panic or assume the worst or something like that. George? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I monitor them. I watch them on a regular basis. I watch them on a daily basis. And I saw one the other day where somebody came out and specifically said, I have it on good authority that there are 200 founders series cars and everybody\u2019s going to be pushed back. And it\u2019s a blatant, factual inaccuracy. And so I went and I shut it down. Those kind of things happen all the time. I try to not contribute to the message boards much at all, but sometimes things just run awry. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Early on, we had gone out with a more firm date, whenever people would configure their cars early on, in early April and May configuring their cars. And our system kicked out a date. There was sort of a projection. And then we sort of left it there as a placeholder. And some of those people have thought that was a firm date. And it never really was. And so we\u2019re correcting that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I watch the boards all the time. You can\u2019t go by what\u2019s on the boards. You just can\u2019t go by what\u2019s on the boards. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think just sort of judge things by what serial number of cars are being delivered and that will give some sense of how we\u2019re tracking to actual deliveries. And you\u2019ll see that number rise quite dramatically. And then I think we\u2019ll see some of this activity on the boards just die down. Because in the absence of information, you can get rampant speculation that\u2019s just not based on anything.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[unintelligible] say anything about short selling. [laughter] </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Restrain yourself. [laughter]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we are one of the most short-selled stocks on the stock market, and there\u2019s certainly people with means, motive, and opportunity to say things that are negative and untrue. I\u2019m not saying that there are, but there\u2019s means, motive, and opportunity to do so. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s helpful, thank you. One final, what leads you to say you\u2019ll have 20,000 reservations by the end of this year? And George, you have talked about it a little bit, but I was just wondering what gets you there? <sub></sub></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t think we ever said we will have 20,000 reservations by the end of the year. We might have that. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s out of the question. Inclusive of deliveries, I think that\u2019s likely that we would have a cumulative, essentially, 20,000 sales. There\u2019s a pretty good chance of that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What does 2013 sold out mean then? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I actually think that 2013 is likely to be production constrained again. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be demand constrained. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you\u2019re saying that over the course of 2013 you\u2019ll have more reservations, or more demand, than you can produce cars? That\u2019s what you mean when you say it will be sold out? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think there will be more orders for cars than we are reasonably able to produce at high quality next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will not have inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will not have inventory, yes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Andrea James \u2013 Dougherty &amp; Company</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so you\u2019re not saying, though, that you\u2019ll get to the end of 2012 and you\u2019ll be sold out on 2013? You\u2019re just saying over the course of 2013 you expect to be sold out. Is that kind of what you meant by that? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the way to look at this is that we never plan to have inventory. And what will happen is demand - we have a plan in place with stores and marketing etc. to get up to a demand rate by month that will always stay ahead of production, and we can adjust production depending on where demand goes. And what will happen is we don\u2019t expect to have 20,000 reservations on an ongoing basis, because that\u2019s way too far out. Our goal is to have three to four months of active reservations at any given point in time ahead of production, whatever the production rate is. So the idea is to get a run rate of reservations that\u2019s three to four months ahead of whatever the production rate is so that we never have the expense of inventory, we never have any of those things. We just have a run rate of three to four months of ongoing reservations. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s fundamental to our retail model. And so that model continues. And we always expect that pipeline to be there ahead. We don\u2019t want it to be too long, because that\u2019s a detractor from more reservations. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right, as we get closer to being able to deliver cars faster, our reservation demand will be stronger, because it will be more predictable, and people will be able to say, okay, I have a lease that\u2019s coming up in three or four months, now\u2019s the time to reserve. And another thing that happens is refunds at that point go almost to nothing because someone will reserve a car, and literally go right into the configuration process within the next 30 days. They\u2019ll configure their car, and then we\u2019ll deliver it in another couple of months. And so that\u2019s the business model. And that\u2019s why it works so perfectly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Michael Lew from Needham. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With regard to the ongoing nationwide tour, how much incremental demand has that generated? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The tour is going really well, and what\u2019s happened is, I think our end of June and July demand has increased for a couple of reasons. One is the news that we\u2019re delivering cars. One is because of the incredible reviews that we\u2019ve gotten on the cars. And I think the third is that we\u2019re putting a lot of people behind the wheel for the first time, and they\u2019re getting out of the car and saying incredible things. They\u2019re then going home and telling their friends, and coming back and getting their friends involved. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re seeing incremental demand because of the tour, but I want to keep a focus on the fact that the tour is really designed for our reservation holders that currently have reservations. We haven\u2019t actually gone out and started having lots of test drives, lots available for new customers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So again, that\u2019s another opportunity for us in another month or so when we actually take the test drive cars we have, and the ones we\u2019re building now, and we go out and we say, okay, now we\u2019ve gone out, we\u2019ve done 5,000-6,000 test drives of reservation holders, and then we start actually giving people who don\u2019t have reservations test drives for the first time. And that\u2019s part of the kick that we will get on new reservations. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, this is actually an important point that George has just made. All these test drives, almost all of them are just for existing customers. Essentially, we could generate more sales if we wanted to. We could grow the rate faster. But there\u2019s not much point in growing the rate faster if it\u2019s nine or ten months before you get the car. There\u2019s just not much point really in trying to add additional orders. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we have an incredibly loyal base. We have an incredibly loyal customer base. And if you look at the people who have already received their cars, and you look at the videos they\u2019re putting together and posting, and the people they\u2019re talking to, we are getting incremental reservations already from the cars we have out there from the people who are driving them and going to dinner, or going to a show, or whatever, with other people who are then calling us and saying, I need to have one like Steve. I want a car like Steve\u2019s. I want a car like Nancy\u2019s. And so we\u2019re getting incremental from having the cars we have out there already. When that starts escalating and we start doing new test drives with people who don\u2019t have reservations, that\u2019s\u2026 </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Essentially, we\u2019re seeing demand acceleration without trying. If we really tried harder it would be more than this. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You don\u2019t have the visibility into where all of our cars are. Here\u2019s something to think about on the demand side. We had the Get Amped test drive tour, which has the marketing cars out there that are doing test drives. We don\u2019t have a Model S at all in Europe or Asia. We don\u2019t have a component tour, we don\u2019t have anything at all in either one of those major markets, and we\u2019re sold out in signature in EU. And so we\u2019re not doing anything outside of North America. And yet we\u2019ve got the backlog we have now. So as we go into the end of Q3 and into Q4, we\u2019re going to start transitioning those markets to Model S, and at that point trying in Europe and Asia for the first time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think a reasonable definition of trying would mean you\u2019ve got at least one car in the market. [laughter] It\u2019s a little surprising to me that I see articles out there questioning whether there\u2019s demand for the Model S. There may be demand issues with other electric vehicles. There\u2019s certainly not a demand issue with Model S. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Michael Lew \u2013 Needham</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And so if I understand correctly, there will be a slight pause and then possibly another tour, let\u2019s say going into the Northeast markets, since you had mentioned that\u2019s on tap, and possibly the Midwest? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Absolutely. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Get Amped tour? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, just in terms of markets that have not been tapped. We\u2019ve barely touched the greater New York area. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we are opening more stores this year, this fall. In fact, one of our next stores will be in the New York metropolitan area, and then we\u2019ll come back with another two. And then we\u2019ll go further north from there into the Massachusetts area and down into the DC area. We think that market holds lots and lots and lots of potential because we already have the number of reservations we have there without a lot of presence. When we have presence, my retail history tells me that there is lots and lots of untapped potential there that we are going to begin tapping starting in September. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually I think a lot of people on the call are probably from the greater New York area, so maybe it would be worth just listing the stores that we\u2019ve opened in the greater New York area, and the ones that will be opening in the next few months. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. For those of you in the New York area, you\u2019re probably aware we have the store on 25th Street. It\u2019s been there for a while. And then we opened up into Westchester, up in Westchester County. And it\u2019s doing very, very well. Very, very nicely. And you know, we see where all the reservations are coming from through each store. And it\u2019s actually increased the reservation flow in the West 25th Street store. So having two stores in the market has helped. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For those of you in North Jersey, we\u2019ll be opening up in Garden State Plaza and Short Hills Mall. And then for you in Long Island, we\u2019ll be looking to open up in Roosevelt Field. So going from one store on West 25th Street to having two in Northern Jersey, one in Westchester County, and one in Long Island, it\u2019s a pretty good capture of the New York metropolitan area with those particular centers surrounding the city. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And our store in Chelsea, we got that lease because it was the only lease we could afford back in the day, and it\u2019s still basically a version 1.5 of store technology. If you want to see the latest in store technology - and I\u2019m not using that word facetiously; there really is store technology - you want to go to the Westchester or the stores that are opening up in New Jersey or Long Island. That will show you the latest and greatest in the retail experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But it just gives you some sense. I count the store in Chelsea as like a half store. And we had a half store until a few months ago in the entire greater New York area. A half store. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And like I said, what\u2019s happened is when we opened up the Westchester, we got that additional awareness and a little bit of publicity and media. We now have two full stores. Because we took the half store and made it into a full store with reservations. And not from a technology standpoint, but from a productivity standpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jeff Evanson </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, I think we\u2019ll take one more question, operator, please. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next question comes from Jesse Pichel from Jeffries. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Deepak, for modeling purposes, what is the targeted cash cycle days conversion we should be thinking about at full ramp? Can we assume sub-20? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m not sure what your question is exactly. Are you referring to our inventory turns? Or working capital needs? I\u2019m not exactly sure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If we take days inventory, days receivable, and days payable, and basically add them up, how quickly can you turn it into cash. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the way we look at it is that fundamentally we have zero receivables. We deliver the car within a few days of production and we get full payment. But our supplier payment terms are on average about 45 days. So we tend to deliver and receive money before we have to pay to our suppliers. So I think from your point of view, more focus is working capital usage, and our needs for working capital don\u2019t increase as we ramp up production. It actually helps us from a cash flow perspective. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The asked question is a good one, because if a business needs to raise equity or something to build working capital as it grows, the effective return on investment for an investor is much lower than if it\u2019s the other way around. In our case, it is the other way around. The faster we grow the business, the more cash we have available. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s what I thought, and why I kind of questioned the Bloomberg article. Are you breaking out X reservations in the quarter? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, we\u2019re putting zero attention on X reservations. It\u2019s not really a metric we want to call people\u2019s attention to. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ll turn our attention to next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do you think some of the reservations for S and X are U.S. delivery from European or Asian clients? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Deepak Ahuja</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Definitely we have reservations. As George mentioned, our Model S reservations include European signature series, where we are sold out. We have reservations from all over the world for both S and X. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But I think also some people who just can\u2019t wait and they\u2019ve ordered a U.S. car and they\u2019re just going to ship it to Europe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, that\u2019s what I was kind of wondering, if the launch in Europe and Asia is really going to increase the reservations that much, or if they are already reserving today. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh yeah, it will increase it massively. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>George Blankenship</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your question is appropriate in that do I think there are five people, ten people who have bought U.S. cars that are going to take them to Europe? Yes. But we have hundreds of reservations in EU, and we\u2019re getting more and more every month. And so that\u2019s going to impact not at all. There will be no impact. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jesse Pichel \u2013 Jefferies </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess it not quite as exotic as picking up your Mercedes from Stuttgart, but I guess you can give them a burger and send them on their way. But you made an interesting comment, Elon, about battery pack replacements allowing the car a better range versus today. You said this before. When can we expect the next battery chemistry improvement, and what\u2019s your roadmap for that? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Elon Musk</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s probably with the Gen III that we\u2019ll see a change in the fundamental chemistry, as we did with Roadster. With Roadster we went from a cobalt cathode to a nickel-cobalt aluminum cathode, and effectively a few percentage increase - roughly [50%] increase in both gravimetric and volumetric [energy density]. And then also a drop in cost, because of the much lower cobalt content. I can\u2019t comment on the specifics of some of the technologies that I\u2019m aware of, because of confidentiality agreements, but I can say I\u2019m highly optimistic about seeing substantial reductions in cost per kilowatt hour in the three to four year timeframe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jeff Evanson </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks everyone. I apologize we didn\u2019t get to everybody today, but this is going to conclude our call. We look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks, either at test drive events. We\u2019ll also be at several conferences, including in New York on August 7 for Needham\u2019s Advanced Industrial Technologies Conference, or on April 13 in Vail at Pacific Crest\u2019s Global Technology Leadership Forum, or on the 14th in New York, again, at the JP Morgan Auto Conference. Thank you everyone.
