Despite significant uncertainty early in the year for large Ag markets, fundamentals improved throughout the fourth quarter driving growth prospects for 2021. Meanwhile, markets for our Construction &amp; Forestry division also improved in the fourth quarter leading to a solid finish to the year and modest levels of recovery projected for fiscal year 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our year end results for 2020 beginning on slide 3. For the full year, net sales and revenue were down 9% to $35.54 billion while net sales for Equipment Operations were down 10% to $31.272 billion. Net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $2.751 billion or $8.69 per diluted share. Net income for the year was negatively affected by impairment charges, losses on business disposals, and employee separation costs of $458 million after-tax. For the same period in 2019, the similar charges were $82 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 4 shows the results for the fourth quarter. Net sales and revenue were down 2% to $9.731 billion while net sales for the Equipment Operation were down 1% to $8.659 billion. Net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company for the quarter was $757 million or $2.39 per diluted share. Fourth quarter net income was negatively affected by impairment charges and employee separation costs of $211 million after-tax compared to $74 million for the same period in 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to a review of our individual businesses starting with Agriculture &amp; Turf on slide 5, net sales were up 8% compared to the fourth quarter last year primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by the unfavorable effects of currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 5 points, while currency translation was negative by 1 point. Operating profit was $860 million resulting in a 13.9% operating margin for the division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The year-over-year increase was driven by price realization and lower R&amp;D expenses and reduced SG&amp;A, improved shipment volumes and mix, and lower warranty expenses. The items were partially offset by impairments and employee separation expenses which totaled $164 million in the quarter. Please note that the $153 million shown on the waterfall is net of $11 million in separation costs from 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For the full year, the Ag &amp; Turf division incurred $286 million in nonrecurring charges including employee separation expenses, impairments, and a loss on a sale. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before reviewing our industry outlook, we\u2019ll first provide commentary on the regional dynamics impacting Ag markets and Deere operations around the globe, starting on slide 6.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the US, farmer sentiment showed improvement over the quarter as the combination of government support and improved commodity prices boosted farm income prospects for the year. Meanwhile, concerns over market access temporarily subsided with exports to China rebounding compared to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Stocks to use and carryout estimates for corn and soybeans are now forecast at multiyear lows due to diminished production on account of some regionally dry weather and the derecho storm in August as well as increased export activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The improvement in fundamentals and farmer sentiment is reflected in the progress of our early order programs. At this time, we\u2019ve concluded all three phases of our planter and sprayer programs, while our combine program recently finished Phase 2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sales for planters are up 10% compared to last year, with sprayers and combines up even further. Meanwhile, our large Ag tractor order book has strengthened over the last quarter with orders up nicely compared to the previous year. Lastly, retail activity picked up in the fourth quarter leaving new and used inventory positions at multiyear lows. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shifting to South America, record soybean production, higher commodity prices, and favorable exchange rates continue to drive positive producer margins in Brazil this year. As a result, activity accelerated in the fourth quarter and far exceeded our forecast, making a very strong finish to 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For fiscal year 2021, the order book is quite strong, reflecting the positive fundamentals with order coverage now extending well into the first half of the year. Similar to North America, the strong finish to the year in Brazil depleted equipment inventory levels below historic averages, keeping momentum for new equipment demand healthy as we begin the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Europe, healthy prices for small grains such as wheat have boosted sentiment for arable farmers and spurred demand in the back half of 2020. Overall, arable margins should see modest gains this year, though results vary throughout some regions experiencing lower production due to dry conditions. Meanwhile, dairy and livestock producers may experience some pressure in fiscal year 2021 from soft dairy margins and growing concerns with respect to African swine fever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, Deere\u2019s operations in Europe have benefited from a more focused strategy and demonstrated an uptick in large Ag market share as well as much improved profitability for the region. Looking ahead, the tractor order book is up relative to last year, providing solid visibility into 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Asia Pacific, key markets like India and Australia rebounded nicely from the early pandemic lockdowns and are expected to resume growth in fiscal year 2021. Meanwhile, operations in other markets are benefiting from some of the disciplined portfolio actions we\u2019ve taken to date.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that context, let\u2019s turn to our 2021 Ag &amp; Turf industry outlook on slide 7. In the US and Canada, we expect Ag industry sales to be up between 5% to 10% for the year. The increase year-over-year reflects improved fundamentals in the Ag sector as well as the historically low inventory levels at the start of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to Europe, the industry outlook is forecast to be flat to up 5% with strength in arable offsetting some weakness in dairy and livestock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In South America, we expect an industry sales increase of about 5% with solid visibility into the first half of the year, especially in Brazil. Industry sales in Asia are forecast to be down slightly, though key markets for Deere are performing slightly better. Lastly, sales of turf and utility equipment are expected to be flat to up 5% following a solid year in 2020. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to our Ag &amp; Turf forecast on slide 8, fiscal year 2021 sales of worldwide Ag &amp; Turf equipment are forecast to be up between 10% and 15%. The incremental increase relative to the industry guidance reflects plans to recover inventory levels in small Ag, which ended the year at historical lows for inventory to sales ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The forecast also includes expectations of 3 points of positive price realization as well as a currency tailwind of about 1 point. For the division\u2019s operating margin, our full year forecast is ranged between 15.5% and 16.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s focus on Construction &amp; Forestry on slide 9. For the quarter, net sales of $2.461 billion were down 16% primarily due to lower shipment volumes partially offset by price realization. Operating profit moved lower year-over-year to $196 million due to lower sales volumes and mix, impairments, and employee separation expenses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The decrease in profit was partially offset by price realization and lower R&amp;D expenses and reduced SG&amp;A, lower warranty expenses, and improved production costs. The total costs for impairments and employee separation charges were $76 million for the quarter, while the full year costs were $184 million. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s turn to our 2021 Construction&amp; Forestry industry outlook on slide 10. Construction Equipment industry sales in the US and Canada are now forecast to be down about 5% with continued uncertainty expected in the oil &amp; gas and non-residential sectors. Meanwhile, compact construction equipment industry sales are expected to increase about 5% as the housing market fundamentals continue to be positive through 2021. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to Global Forestry, we now expect the industry to be flat to up 5% as the recovery in lumber demand, particularly in North America, should lead to increased production throughout the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to the C&amp;F division outlook on slide 11, Deere\u2019s Construction &amp; Forestry 2021 net sales are forecast to be up between 5% and 10% compared to last year. Our net sales guidance for the year includes expectations of about 1 point of positive price realization and a currency tailwind of about 1 point. We expect the division\u2019s operating margin to be ranged between 9% to 10% for the year benefiting from price, volume, and non-reoccurring expenses from 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let\u2019s move now to our Financial Services operations on slide 12. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company in the fourth quarter was $186 million benefiting from lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values and favorable financing spreads partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses and employee separation expenses. For fiscal year 2021, the net income forecast is $630 million which contemplates a tax rate between 24% to 26%. The provision for credit losses forecast for 2021 is 27 basis points. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before moving on to the 2021 company outlook, I\u2019d like to welcome our Chief Technology Officer, Jahmy Hindman, to the call. Jahmy recently assumed the CTO position and played a pivotal role in shaping our smart industrial strategy and vision for Deere\u2019s technology stack. Jahmy?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jahmy Hindman</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Brent. As noted, I recently assumed the newly-created Chief Technology Officer position and I spent the last few months finalizing our organizational design and refining our technology strategy to best enable the smart industrial operating model. I\u2019ve been with Deere for over 20 years in a variety of engineering roles in both the Ag &amp; Turf and Construction &amp; Forestry divisions, and most recently led engineering for the global tractor product family.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Most simply put, the Chief Technology Office is responsible for delivering Deere\u2019s technology stack. Think of our tech stack as a full set of components required to deliver technology solutions to our customers. For nearly 25 years, Deere has invested in core technologies and capabilities that can be leveraged across the enterprise. These core competencies are primarily focused around machine guidance, digital connectivity, machine intelligence, and more recently, autonomy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Historically, Deere operated within multiple disparate business units that were spread out throughout the enterprise to pursue innovations in these core technologies. As part of our redesign, we\u2019ve consolidated these units under the CTO organization. This drives a higher degree of focus and unlocks significant efficiencies for our R&amp;D investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our approach to precision technology as shown on slide 13 is distinct within the industry, as we\u2019ve maintained end-to-end development responsibility for our tech stack, developing unique solutions from the embedded hardware and software in our equipment, to the digital platforms our customers utilize. While we\u2019ve pursued a vertically integrated path for our core capabilities, we have chosen to partner with others for noncore technologies, things like graphical processing units and cameras. Additionally, we\u2019ve opened up our digital platform to include over 185 API partners. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over time, our philosophy has remained consistent, as depicted on slide 14. We seek to develop or acquire core technologies that add value and are unique to the jobs that our customers do, while outsourcing noncore technologies when partners can bring scale or offer faster speed to market. In any case, we maintain the development responsibility for the final solution to ensure seamless integration into our equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This approach has served us well, and traces its genesis back to our acquisition of NavCom in 1999. At that time, we decided to own certain technology competencies starting with satellite guidance. The acquisition delivered a foundational element to our tech stack and it enabled us to lead the industry in innovation from the early days of AutoTrac to turn automation and now AutoPath, which is our latest solution for path planning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Furthermore, by owning this technology, we\u2019ve been able to scale guidance innovation throughout our entire large Ag fleet. We followed similar blueprints with other core technologies from our acquisition of Phoenix International in 1999 to the organic development of the John Deere Operations Center beginning in 2012. Our acquisition of Blue River Technology in 2017 reflects our view that machine learning and computer vision are essential competencies required for the next generation of machine intelligence and automation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similar to other core technologies, we see wide applicability of Blue River\u2019s competencies across our large Ag product portfolio and also intend to leverage the vision systems for obstacle detection in our Construction &amp; Forestry division. Essentially this technology can be applied to optimize machine use and job outcomes anywhere a human operator controls or adjusts machine settings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ultimately, we believe that a complete tech stack delivers the most value for our customers when it\u2019s paired with the underlying equipment and a dealer network that can support it. This seamless integration is key to achieving the highest levels of productivity and sustainability and is a requirement for innovations like plant-level management and autonomy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Furthermore, our comprehensive system delivers the ability for equipment to become smarter throughout the course of a production system. While many industry players offer point solutions for a given technology or a specific production step, we offer customers a system advantage where the combined equipment and the information from the technology stack passes insights to each proceeding and subsequent step in the production system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, our sprayers leverage the guidance lines from planting for more efficiency and accuracy resulting in less crop damage, while our tillage operations are informed by the previous year\u2019s harvest data. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 15 highlights the comprehensive systems we are building. The first component of our Precision Ag system is the most important and can\u2019t be overlooked. Our Precision Ag strategy begins with the underlying equipment that executes the job in the field. While our industry is attracting new players from non-traditional disciplines such as software or robotics, these technologies must ultimately be paired with Ag equipment to accomplish the tasks in the field.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, Deere\u2019s primary advantage comes from a product offering that spans each step in the production system paired with the industry largest installed base and coupled with complementary technology applied to each product within that production system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The last component required to deliver Precision solutions is a dealer network that can fill, service, and support the latest technologies. Increasingly, the last mile is becoming one of the most critical enablers for precision adoption and our channel has been leading the industry in terms of modernizing their capabilities and their staff.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In short, our Precision strategy is very much a system of Ag equipment combined with core technologies and a dealer support network working in concert together to make farming more productive and more sustainable. While we are immensely proud of the success we\u2019ve achieved so far, we are even more enthusiastic about the runway of opportunity that\u2019s ahead of us. Throughout our Precision journey, we\u2019ve experienced several inflection points where technology advancements unlock new possibilities and extend our runway beyond our prior ambitions. Innovations and connectivity, advanced onboard computing, and artificial intelligence have reset the realm of possibilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, we see many years of runway for each of our existing core technologies individually. Furthermore, the opportunity set extends much further as we begin stacking these core capabilities to create new functionality in our future product roadmaps. Over the course of the year, we look forward to providing further details regarding the opportunity set in front of us and will also provide further color on some of the exciting product releases coming to market in the near-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before turning the call back over, I\u2019d like to offer a few comments on the acquisition of Harvest Profit, a software platform that\u2019s focused on farmer profitability. We are striving to make our customers the most profitable and sustainable in their industry. We can\u2019t accomplish that without being able to help customers measure profitability. Harvest Profit gives us a significant boost in ensuring we help customers make more profitable and sustainable decisions in the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, with the Precision Ag opportunity set growing substantially over the next decade, we see significant value in our ability to ascribe value of our precision tools to our customers and this acquisition provides us a path to attribute that value, thus furthering the adoption of technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ryan Campbell for yearend guidance and closing thoughts. Ryan?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ryan Campbell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Jahmy. Slide 16 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate, and operating cash flow. For fiscal year 2021, our full year outlook for net income is forecast to be between $3.6 billion to $4 billion. It\u2019s important to note that constraints in the supply base and labor force availability due to COVID-19 remain key risks to our fiscal year 2021 guide. The guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be 26% to 28%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, cash flow from the Equipment Operations is expected to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion and contemplates a $700 million voluntary contribution to our OPEB plan. Before we respond to your questions, I\u2019d like to offer some perspective on 2020, the prospects ahead of us, and a few thoughts on our portfolio and capital allocation strategy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look back on 2020, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the exceptional efforts taken by our employees, suppliers, and dealer channel this year. Employees across our company logged extra hours and adapted to an ever-changing environment to create safe working conditions and ensure the supply of parts and equipment to our customers so that they could continue their essential work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similarly, our dealers quickly adjusted to the pandemic and played a critical role keeping our customers\u2019 businesses operating. This year served as a reminder of just how impressive our dealer group is, and we are grateful for the tremendous performance they put forth. And as a result of the effort put forth by employees, suppliers, and dealers, we posted one of the strongest fourth quarter performances in company history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding costs associated with employee separations and impairments, our Construction &amp; Forestry division achieved 11% margins, the highest fourth quarter since 2014. Similarly, Ag &amp; Turf fourth quarter margins excluding special items were approximately 16.5%, which is the highest fourth quarter in the division\u2019s history, eclipsing results from 2013 despite around $1 billion less in net sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While encouraged by our recent results, we are even more excited by the opportunity ahead of us. In the midst of addressing a global pandemic, we also instituted a new strategy for the company over the year. In doing so, we accomplished three primary objectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One, we\u2019ve reorganized the company around production systems to mirror the way our customers do business. Two, we\u2019ve taken significant strides towards optimizing our cost structure. And three, we\u2019ve adapted our investment priorities to ensure a greater degree of focus on the products and solutions that are most differentiated and unlock the highest value to our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A more focused R&amp;D investment strategy is essential to realizing the value of the technology stack that Jahmy just described. While we spent decades investing in the core competencies to comprise our current technology stack, we see significant runway ahead to build on what we have done and advance technology for our next generation of solutions, and our new strategy plays a vital role in unlocking the necessary capital to achieve the potential we believe is possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">2020 has been a year of change at Deere, and that has included some activity with respect to our portfolio. In some cases, we\u2019ve made decisions to exit businesses or reduce footprint to serve markets more efficiently, while in other areas, we\u2019ve added to our capabilities such as our recent purchases of Unimil and Harvest Profit. As we contemplate 2021, we expect to continue our portfolio evaluation which may result in additional activity throughout the duration of the year. As such, we intend to provide regular updates on subsequent earnings calls as we take actions in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, while we\u2019ve made efforts to better focus the internal investments we are making, please know that our overall priorities related to our cash resources remain the same. We remain committed to our A-rating and will continue to fund our operations at levels that support our strategic initiatives. Next, we\u2019ll pay a dividend within our targeted income range, and with other priorities secured, we will return capital through our share repurchase program. We resumed the program in the fourth quarter and will continue to execute on our capital priorities in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Josh Jepsen</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Ryan. Now we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&amp;A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the procedures. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we\u2019d ask that you please rejoin the queue. Robin?</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about Ag &amp; Turf incremental margins from here? Obviously, you got to really strong margins much earlier in the cycle than most of us expected. How should we think about operating leverage from here assuming we do get a multiyear Ag &amp; Turf recovery? Can you still, off of these higher-levels, deliver 30%-plus incremental margins as we think about what a multiyear recovery could look like?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, thanks, Jerry. As it relates to the margins and thinking about this next year, 2021, 15.5% to 16.5% absolute margins, we do expect that we can do the roughly 30% to 35% from an incremental basis in kind of the underlying operations. I think when you think about this year, a few things to consider as far as potential or not potential headwinds in the forecast would be incentive comp has moved up and is a bit higher in 2021 from a company-wide perspective, that\u2019s about $160 million headwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then we are seeing a little bit higher overhead costs. Some of that\u2019s related to volume, but certainly still have some of that related to just overall caution as it relates to COVID and the impacts as we\u2019re seeing spread in contagion in a lot of our key geographies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ryan Campbell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, Jerry, it\u2019s Ryan. I think the way to think about it, we structurally improved the profitability of the Equipment Operations including Ag &amp; Turf, but we intend over the long run to still operate with that flexibility that gives us the ability to perform on an incremental basis in the 30% to 35% range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess my question if we just, if you assume the high end of your guide on the sales and on the margin front, it implies your margins are already almost hitting the 15% mid-cycle margin target that you guys have laid out. So I\u2019m just, what\u2019s embedded in your view of the cycle in your 2021 guidance? And I guess the longer-term question is are we further along than we thought we would be? Do we need to revisit that target? I\u2019m just wondering if the market under appreciates the margin story for Deere longer-term. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you think about where we\u2019re at in the cycle, Ag &amp; Turf this year, we\u2019re projecting to be pretty close to mid-cycle. That said, mix is still not normal. We think large Ag in North America is around 90% of mid-cycle, small Ag overall a little bit above mid-cycle, so relatively close but not there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s, I think what we\u2019ve seen is significant progress on the margin front. As Ryan mentioned, feel like we\u2019ve structurally improved our ability to perform and execute and drive that margin level, so we\u2019re continuing to work on that, and as implied with our guidance this next year, expect being above that 15% target for Ag &amp; Turf in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But in total for the company, is the 15% too low now, I guess I\u2019m asking? Because we\u2019re getting there on a combined basis and we\u2019re not even at mid-cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, Jamie, the goal was for 2022 kind of at mid-cycle. We\u2019ll continue to execute and deliver on that, and then 2022, we\u2019ll take a step back and reflect on what we want to drive into the future particularly focusing on making the investments that really can change the game for our customers and create value for them. So hang with us and wait until we execute and deliver in 2022, but we\u2019ve got a long runway of things that we can do to make our customers better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And thank you. Our next question is Steven Fisher with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Fisher</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning. Just curious to ask you about how you\u2019re factoring in raw materials costs for fiscal 2021. We\u2019re seeing some steel price increases, but I notice your COGS percent assumed is lower in the forecast, so just curious what you kind of \u2013 how you\u2019ve thought about that in front half versus back half. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Steve, when we look at material, we\u2019ve had a tailwind in 2020 from a material point of view, in particular, on steel. That\u2019s after we saw increases in 2018 and into 2019, so it has been favorable at this point. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look forward into 2021, our contracts, we tend to cover a quarter, a little bit more in terms of the lag time between price movements and when we see those come through, so we have some coverage there. So to your point, to the extent you see some of that inflation, probably more impactful later in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That said, as we kind of step back and look at material overall, are seeing some of those trends in terms of prices moving up but we\u2019re also pretty confident in some cost reduction projects and things we have going on that we think about material kind of coming in relatively stable year-over-year. Thanks, Steve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Volkmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m wondering if we can spend a moment on the pricing question? You guys obviously had very good pricing especially in A&amp;T in the fourth quarter, and I guess the outlook is pretty good as well. Can you just kind of describe what you\u2019re seeing there and why it\u2019s as positive as it?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Pricing, Steve, you\u2019re right, was better than expected in the fourth quarter. I think maybe backing up, what hasn\u2019t changed is our philosophy on pricing. You continue to focus on value and the upside that we can create for our customers. I think when you look specifically at what we saw in the fourth quarter for Ag &amp; Turf, there were a few things that drove that level of pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One, and we noted, Brent kind of mentioned this in his comments, we had tighter inventory positions kind of across most of our geographies and models in particular on small tractors and turf that drove less spend as a result of tighter levels of inventory. That\u2019s one component.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The other piece, and we talked a little bit about this last quarter, we saw more of it this quarter, was the cost for low rate programs, so buying down interest rates to offer low rate programs to our customers, which are pretty prevalent in small tractors and turf. That cost was lower as a result of just lower interest rates in the market. So that was impactful. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly, we saw pricing overseas. We had continued strength in a number of overseas markets that benefited price in the quarter. So we ended the year strong, obviously, and are forecasting about three points next year, so continue to manage that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think part of that too, you think about as we go into the year with tighter inventories, we think that lends itself to a little bit lighter incentive spending as we work to recover some of that inventory in 2021. Thanks, Steve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Go ahead and jump to our next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ann Duignan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. I just wanted to ask you about your comment that you\u2019re only up about 90% of mid-cycle in large Ag going into fiscal 2021. That seems a little inconceivable to me given that farmers are sitting there with $50 billion in excess government payments this year on top of $24 billion that they received last year, and so the notion that they\u2019re not spending now given the fundamentals and given the extra money they have and with government payments expected to revert to normal going forward, why wouldn\u2019t 2021 represent the new peak, not 90% of normal?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so maybe as we think about that, a little bit of a journey. Last year, 2020 we were around 80% of mid-cycle for large Ag in North America, so we\u2019re seeing that step up to about 90%, so we are seeing that. Maybe taking a few of those pieces of your comments there as it relates to what\u2019s going on, government support obviously has been very strong. I think from a customer perspective, the preference would be access to markets over aid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think that\u2019s underlying and as we\u2019ve seen some of the export markets open up, I think you\u2019re seeing more sentiment improve. But the aid has in large part in our view been used to pay down debt and really manage and shore up our balance sheets, so I think that\u2019s been a positive. And underlying that also, you\u2019re seeing strong land values in the Midwest seeing some upward movement in land values, so I think underpinning there a really strong balance sheet for farmers, particularly as we exit the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fundamentals have moved and they\u2019ve moved really over the last six weeks, so it\u2019s been pretty recent on the back of kind of revisions down of ending inventories of commodities, China purchases, and then obviously the aid that you mentioned. All of those, we\u2019ve seen impact sentiment, so those things have been positive. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think as it relates to looking forward, we don\u2019t expect aid to recur, but we do believe higher commodity prices are going to benefit cash receipts as we go forward, so we don\u2019t expect a huge downward movement in cash receipts for principal crops in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Saying all of that, I think we step back and say we are seeing demand pick up. We\u2019re seeing that in early order programs and the large tractor order book that Brent mentioned, so I think we\u2019re really kind of at an inflection point right now where we\u2019re seeing demand move. We would say there\u2019s still a long runway of replacement demand as you look at the age of the fleet and those sorts of things, so we think we\u2019re a ways off mid-cycle let alone peak. Thanks, Ann. We\u2019ll go ahead and jump to our next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Robert Wertheimer with Melius Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robert Wertheimer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks. Just, I mean, obviously, you\u2019ve had a very dynamic year with a lot going on. I wonder if you have any updated thoughts on either the buckets of margin as you think the end of the year structural goal and there\u2019s a mention you\u2019re pretty far advanced on that path. And maybe if not that, I mean, do you see the same sort of long-term potential rising up in construction margins? There\u2019s a little bit less strength there I guess versus Ag and then just maybe a little bit less potential on the tech side, I\u2019m not sure. So just your thoughts on margin buckets and/or construction structural margin. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, Rob, I think overall bucket-wise, not a lot of change as we think about the path to 15%. Certainly cost we\u2019ve done a lot of work on the cost side as it relates to structure as well as we\u2019ve begun work on footprint and those sorts of things, so we feel good about the progress there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Aftermarket continues to be something we\u2019re focused on. That\u2019s not something that changes immediately, but we like the organizational structure and the priorities that we\u2019ve laid out there for the team and making good initial progress. And then Precision Ag as Jahmy outlined continues to be an opportunity for us and I think as we continue to develop technology, I think we see more and more opportunity to leverage and that\u2019s really where Jahmy\u2019s new org steps in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to construction, certainly I think continuing to operate efficiently there. We\u2019ve tried to be really disciplined on price, and you\u2019ve seen that over the course of 2020 which has aided margins. The road building side of the business we think is going to be a substantial contributor as we think about the overall delivering 15% margin. And this year, the road building side worked through a really choppy year and performed very, very well and proved out part of the hypothesis there that they are going to be less cyclical and that was certainly the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">They ended the year down about 8% compared to construction which was down much more significantly. Maybe the last thing on the construction side where we do think we have an opportunity to drive margin and differentiation is on technology, so maybe I\u2019ll ask Jahmy to talk a little bit about how we think we can leverage technology in C&amp;F and road building.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, thanks, Rob, for the question. I do think if you look at Precision generally, many of the technologies that we\u2019re developing on the Ag side have applicability at the component level within our construction and road building products as well, and the benefits of Precision extend to that business also, this need to be more precise with equipment, reduce the amount of time the equipment spends on a job site to do the job, those sorts of things all factor into our ability to take technology that we\u2019re developing within the enterprise and apply it to the construction and road building products as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Chad Dillard with Bernstein. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chad Dillard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Can you talk about your Precision Ag take rates and early order program, how are rates for ExactEmerge and Apply, how they compare versus last year, and have you started to offer spray as a part of the early order program and give some color on take rates there? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then just lastly, just maybe you could talk about the roadmap for Precision Ag beyond corn and soybean ecosystem and will it require new technology beyond the current offering? Just that. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ryan Campbell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I\u2019ll start there. I mean, from an early order program, we saw take rates kind of in line with what we talked about a quarter ago. So in the low 40s on ExactEmerge, high 40s, near 50 on ExactApply, and then combines are actually in the 70s. So those specific solutions now, we\u2019ve got a few years under our belt. We\u2019re seeing continued strong adoption there which has been positive and I think just clearly demonstrating the value of what those can do when you think about executing the job those customers are performing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe from a sprayer perspective, Jahmy, do you want to talk a little bit about just what we\u2019re seeing from a technology perspective having it out in the field?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so we\u2019ve had machines with customers over the last prototype machines over the last 12 months and especially this summer learned a lot. We will have machines with customers next summer as well and the feedback has largely been outstanding. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">People gravitate to the value proposition. They get it, they understand it, and it\u2019s easily demonstrable. And I\u2019ll maybe take a different direction past see and spray and just talk on the question about how applicable is technology outside of corn and soy from a production system perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re really doing is we\u2019re giving machines vision and intelligence, and that extends well past the sort of a multi-dimensional runway. It extends well past corn and soy into other Ag production systems. It also extends past the Ag production systems into several of our Construction &amp; Forestry and roadbuilding segments, and so there\u2019s a lot of opportunity out there just with making machines more capable from a vision and intelligence perspective, and then there\u2019s another dimension of that that\u2019s the data thread that that creates that links all of these steps within a production system together. So really exciting stuff to come and definitely applicable outside of corn and soy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ryan Campbell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe one last thing to add-on to that, Chad, is we\u2019re also seeing opportunity on geographic growth from a Precision Ag perspective. We see really strong upward movement and engaged acres globally but in particular, in South America and in Europe. So as we think about you got this opportunity on a geographic basis across Ag &amp; Turf and C&amp;F and then essentially every job that customers are doing. Thanks, Chad. We\u2019ll go ahead and go to our next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is Joel Tiss with BMO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joel Tiss</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, guys. I just wondered if you can talk a little more deeply about C&amp;F from like a structural standpoint and the ability to get the 15% operating margins? And maybe also just the touching on the ability to get paid for putting Precision software into the machines. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I think that on the margin side, we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019ve seen I think the division perform pretty resiliently through a year in which sales were down pretty significantly. And we North American Construction Equipment we took out about 30% of field inventory, so pretty significant action this year to put us in position to build in line with retail next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I think the actions we\u2019re taking overall as a company as it relates to cost structure are beneficial here. Jahmy\u2019s organization from a CTO perspective pulling the technology together to be able to leverage across we think that\u2019s a big opportunity, and that he just mentioned a few examples of where we think we can do that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The roadbuilding side continues to be one where we see the opportunity to continue to grow there and grow margin as we execute both integration plans and everything else there. So I think we feel like we\u2019ve got a runway there to improve and continuing to focus on markets and products where we can differentiate to deliver margin performance. Thanks, Joel. We\u2019ll go ahead and jump to our next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Raso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. With the A&amp;T sales midpoint guide, the 12.5%, but 4% of that you note is price and currency, that\u2019s only about obviously 8.5% implied volume, so if my math is right, the way you destock small Ag this year in 2020, the small Ag business alone just returning back in line with retail with their production almost accounts for almost all that 8.5% volume growth. So I just want to make sure, if those numbers are correct, are you indeed implying large Ag sales in 2021 are really not growing much at all, and if so, given the order book commentary, the inventory commentary, why is that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so when you think about the kind of the sales and linking that up with the outlooks, I mean, the biggest components of that are from a large Ag perspective in North America we expect to build in line with retail. Small Ag roughly we expect to be flat in North America. To your point, we will produce above retail on small tractors, and we expect to build some inventory we\u2019re coming off historic lows. Last year I think we ended at 55% inventory to sales. This year we ended at 20%, so we will see some recovery there. But again, we expect that market to be relatively flat but we will build some inventory there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In South America, Brazil in particular, we will probably recover. We expect to recover a little bit of inventory that got depleted in 4Q as the market turned pretty strongly in the fourth quarter. So you\u2019re right. I mean, I think when you combine price and FX with kind of North America being up some, South America being up some, and then over production to recover, replenish inventory on small tractors, that\u2019s kind of the math to get to those numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Raso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A clarification, you said large Ag in North America in line with retail. Is that not up in an up retail forecast, meaning did you not destock at all in 2020 to where you\u2019ll actually produce lower than retail is up? I don\u2019t understand the flat coming off a year of some destock and you think retail is up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, we produced in line with large Ag in 2020 and we intend to do the same in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Raso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So up a little bit. Okay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks, David. We\u2019ll go ahead and jump to our next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Your next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Nicole DeBlase</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey there. Just wanted to make sure you could hear me. So I guess maybe looking at the October retail sales trends, I think in all the categories ex-four-wheel drive tractors, it looks like Deere came in a bit below the industry. Could you just maybe explain a bit about what\u2019s going on there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I think either -- a few things at play there. Given our order fulfillment model, focus on inventory management, and obviously some of this demand is lumpy throughout the year, we will at times lose a little bit of short-term market share at inflection points, and I think that\u2019s some of what we saw this year particularly as we got towards the end of the year where we were tighter on inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And as we work through 2020 with the uncertainty kind of broad ranged across agriculture and even on the small tractor and turf side, we were tried to pretty diligently manage those inventories and we were lighter at the end of the year when we saw the inflection. Historically what we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve been able to recover that as we build that back up, so I think that\u2019s our expectation that you see us recover that as we go forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ryan Campbell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Josh said, sometimes an inflection point given our order fulfillment strategy, we may, on the margin, miss a few tractor or combine shares, but history would tell us that we recover that back very quickly. And over the long run, we\u2019re heads down focused on creating sustainable market share growth through creating differentiated value for our customers, so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is Larry De Maria with William Blair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry De Maria</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Appreciate the tech stack discussion. We don\u2019t see on there as obviously Deere prescribed agronomy, but obviously agronomy has been everywhere, but you bought a software company and you\u2019re developing and have bought some AI capabilities. It seems logical with the roadmap that maybe being in a position to recommend seed since you have a data and are getting down to the individual plant level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m just kind of curious as this roadmap plays out can you get into the prescription seed recommendation game, because it seems like it\u2019s going that way? Or alternatively, maybe it\u2019s more about making sure you can attribute value to Deere so you can gain greater pricing and greater wallet share from customers. So just trying to think and see how this plays out over the next few years and as you maybe come into more conflict with seed companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Ryan Campbell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, thanks for the question, I\u2019ll take it. I think the way to think about that right now is we\u2019re really focused on creating the data and collecting the data that any individual grower needs in order to make decisions exactly like the one that you\u2019re talking about, what seed hybrid they might plant in any given year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And at some point in the future, I think we\u2019ll have the growers have enough information because of the data they\u2019ve collected over the previous production system steps over the previous years to optimize that seed choice, but in the end, that\u2019s their choice to make. They have a responsibility or they have a relationship with their trusted advisors whoever that might be and their agronomic community and they are the ones that end up making that decision as they see it as best for their farm in any given year, given their operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Adam Uhlman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, guys. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Ryan, I was wondering if you could provide us a little bit more color on the guidance for the year in terms of how you see the cadence playing out maybe first half to second half in terms of sales and margin, any important moving pieces that we should keep in mind? And then can you confirm if there\u2019s any material restructuring charges left in the guidance for this year? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, this is Josh. I\u2019ll start. As you think about cadence of the year, I don\u2019t think we expect to see much abnormal from a seasonality perspective, so I think we\u2019d expect both divisions to kind of play out relatively normally, nothing major kind of that would disrupt that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think as it relates to one-time charges those sorts of things, the employee separation actions, we don\u2019t have or expect anything in 2021 in the guide. We\u2019ve got that all in 2020. To the extent we continue to work on portfolio optimization, those sorts of things, we could see charges there, but as we would execute on those, we will provide updates then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, as Josh said, nothing unique in next year\u2019s cadence and then we don\u2019t have forecasted charges in the guide for next year. We are still assessing kind of operations and footprint globally. As we make those decisions, we\u2019ll obviously identify any costs associated with those during our quarterly calls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Mig Dobre with Baird. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mig Dobre</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to Construction &amp; Forestry, the margin discussion there, and recognizing that you had a lot of sort of discrete costs that impacted you in fiscal 2020 that now are clearly going away. It seems as if I\u2019m doing the math right here, that the incremental margin that you\u2019re guiding to is somewhere in the low- to mid-20s here, so I guess my question is this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, where are we in terms of roadbuilding\u2019s margin and is the path to 13%, 14% operating margin for that business still there, and how do you see that? And sort of what\u2019s being embedded here in terms of incremental margin longer-term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, I think for incrementals on the business in 2021, we\u2019re in that range of 20% to 25% which is traditionally where we\u2019d expect to be. As you think about roadbuilding, we had a really, really strong quarter in roadbuilding in 4Q, and as we look forward, we think that continues to improve, even ex-items where we were this year, we expect next year with top line moving up call it roughly 10%, we think that margin steps up again. So I think we feel really good about the performance there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And maybe just to reiterate a comment I made earlier, as we think about the 15% and how do we get there, we think the roadbuilding piece is a substantial contributor to that margin story as we go forward. Thanks, Mig. We\u2019ll go ahead and go to the next question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Courtney Yakavonis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Good morning, guys. Just wondering maybe following on the roadbuilding discussion I think on C&amp;F you gave us an outlook for North America construction and compact and forestry, but can you maybe just share with us what your thoughts on the outlook for roadbuilding was and was there substantial underproduction? How did those inventory levels kind of finish this year and what we should be thinking for next year? And also, as it relates to North America versus China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so, we expect it\u2019s a little bit hard on the industry, so we tend to talk about roadbuilding more than just what we expect from our business there and we think that\u2019s up about 10% next year after being down about 8% in 2020, so seeing some nice recovery there in that business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Inventory-wise, I think we feel like we\u2019re in good shape. I think over the course of 2019 and a little bit of 2020, we took some more targeted actions on some of the different brands to adjust inventory as we integrated order fulfillment philosophies. But now I feel like we feel like going into 2021 we\u2019re in good shape across those brands. Thanks, Courtney.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Gilardi</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, guys. Good morning. Can you clarify that the 90% of mid-cycle for large Ag is projected 2021 where you\u2019ll finish, or was that actual 2020? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then historically, how far above are you mid-cycle at the peak for Ag &amp; Turf? Some of the concern out there seems to be that 2021 is somehow peak in Ag &amp; Turf which seems very hard to contemplate when revenue growth hasn\u2019t even turned positive yet and you only have 2021 Ag &amp; Turf up 10% to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so, the 90% is our forecast as we stand now for 2021, so we think we\u2019ve moved from basically call it 80% to 90% as we look forward. Now, importantly, we\u2019ve really seen kind of activity turn in the last four to six weeks, so obviously we\u2019ve had early order programs going, but as you think about kind of underlying fundamentals for farmers, things have improved from a commodity price perspective, lower stock levels, and that\u2019s all really happened very, very recently. So I think I wouldn\u2019t overly interpret what\u2019s happened in four weeks and that that\u2019s everything that\u2019s possible there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So we\u2019re still managing it, working through with our dealers and customers where we\u2019re at. We feel like we\u2019re pretty well positioned having managed new inventories tightly. Maybe more importantly, used is in really good shape, used inventory levels are down in places we haven\u2019t been since call it before 2014. Used prices on the large Ag side are seeing upward pressure, so I think the backdrop and all those things that we\u2019ve thought would drive replacement demand and support replacement demand that have been stalled over the last year or two, we\u2019ve seen some of those things turn and be more favorable for farmers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jahmy Hindman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Josh on that, wouldn\u2019t your normal peak be 20% to 25% above mid-cycle for Ag &amp; Turf? If that\u2019s the case, historically, the trough-to-peak move would be something like a 30%-type number, not a 10% to 15% number, that\u2019s what I was trying to clarify in my question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, sorry. I forgot that part of your question. Yeah, we would consider 120%, 20% above as peak, and that\u2019s as we plan and certainly if you go back to 2013, large Ag in North America was 130%, so that was, so we\u2019ve been much higher and higher than even 120%, but that\u2019s the way we plan. So thanks, Ross. We\u2019ll go ahead and try to get one more question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Weber, RBC Capital Markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Weber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, guys. Thanks, and good morning. Happy thanksgiving. Just a question on the South American industry Ag outlook. Up 5% seems kind of conservative. It sounds like you\u2019re messaging that your order book is up materially here at the end of the year. So can you just frame that? Are you expecting something to really sort of drop off in the back half of the year in South America? Is it just uncertainty around financing programs, or any color you\u2019d talk to as to the 5% growth for South America. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yeah, so, I mean, up 5% for all South America, I think your question maybe a little more targeted on Brazil specifically. Fundamentals have been really strong. We saw fourth quarter demand was from a retail perspective was strong and strong enough that you actually saw the year swing from kind of a negative industry to positive, so that\u2019s moved quickly. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Brent mentioned our order books were ordered out through March, one thing that does, when you think about the comparison then, the strong fourth quarter is now intercom, so we\u2019ll anniversary that strong industry in 2021, so I think that\u2019s part of it. But I think overall, we\u2019re seeing dynamics there have been favorable and maybe a little bit of caution as it relates to China buying more grains from the US and what exactly does that mean for them but overall, I think very, very positive outlook on Brazil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Josh Jepsen</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, with that, I think we\u2019re at the top of the hour, so we\u2019ll wrap it up. But appreciate all of the interest. I hope everyone has a good Thanksgiving, and we\u2019ll talk soon. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And thank you.
