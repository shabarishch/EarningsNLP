Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">John Deere achieved higher production rates in the third quarter, resulting in 25% increase in net sales despite ongoing supply challenges. Financial results for the quarter included an 18% margin for the equipment operations. Ag fundamentals remain solid with our order books beginning to fill for model year \u201823 products, reflecting continued healthy demand as we look ahead. The construction and forestry markets also continue to benefit from demand, contributing to the division\u2019s strong performance in the quarter. Similarly, order books are now extending into 2023, providing visibility into the New Year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 3 shows the results for the second quarter. Net sales and revenues were up 22% to $14.1 billion while net sales for the equipment operations were up 25% to $13 billion. Net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company was $1.884 billion or $6.16 per diluted share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking at results by segment, beginning with our Production &amp; Precision Ag business on slide 4. Net sales of $6.096 billion were up 43% compared to the third quarter last year, largely due to higher production and shipment volumes. Price realization in the quarter was positive by about 15 points, whereas currency translation was negative by about 4 points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operating profit was $1.293 billion, resulting in a 21% operating margin for the segment. The year-over-year increase in operating profit was primarily due to price realization and higher shipment volumes, partially offset by higher production costs and higher SA&amp;G and R&amp;D spend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The production costs were mostly elevated material and freight. Overhead spend was also higher for the period as persistent supply challenges continued to cause production inefficiencies. Despite these challenges, factories were able to achieve higher rates of production and made progress on reducing the number of partially completed machines in inventory. Our factories are focused on finishing and shipping the remaining machines in the fourth quarter which will help our progress toward restoring productivity and efficiencies going into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The increased SA&amp;G and R&amp;D spend reflects our continued development of our technology stack and our progress on our LEAP ambitions, both of which will unlock additional value for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next Small Ag &amp; Turf on slide 5. Net sales were up 16%, totaling $3.635 billion in the third quarter due to higher shipment volumes and price realization more than offsetting negative currency translation. Price realization in the quarter was positive by 10 points while currency translation was negative by over 4 points. For the quarter, operating profit was down year-over-year at $552 million, resulting in a 15% operating margin. The decreased profit was primarily due to higher production costs, specifically materials, offset by price realization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the industry outlook on slide 6. We expect U.S. and Canada industry sales of large ag equipment to be up around 15%. While the industry continues to be constrained by supply, demand remains robust and our guidance assumes a heavier back-end loaded year for industry retail.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to the industry, we\u2019ve had our strongest results in high horsepower row crop tractors, and we plan to end the year approaching our highest market share on record. Our order books for the remainder of the current fiscal year are full, and we see signs of robust demand into 2023 with some order books already full through the first half of next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Small Ag &amp; Turf industry demand continues to be estimated generally flat this year. While we see steadiness from our hay and forage segment, consumer products such as contact utility tractors and turf equipment, are down due to supply constraints, low turf inventory and moderating demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to Europe. The industry is forecasted to be roughly flat, despite solid demand. While supply constraints and operating challenges are affecting the industry, we expect to finish the year with higher shipments and market share gains. In South America, we expect industry sales of tractors and combines to increase by about 10% to 15%. Despite the low trend crop yields due to inclement weather, customers are very profitable this year, benefiting from high commodity prices. Industry sales in Asia are still forecasted to be down moderately as India, the world\u2019s largest tractor market by unit, has moderated from record volumes achieved in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to our segment forecast on slide 7. Production &amp; Precision Ag net sales continue to be forecasted up between 25% and 30% in fiscal year \u201822. The forecast assumes nearly 14 points of positive price realization for the full year, which will allow us to be price/cost positive for the fiscal year. This is partially offset by roughly 2 points of currency headwind. For the segment\u2019s operating margin, our full year forecast is between 20% and 21%. The forecast reflects higher costs for material and freight inflation as well as the elevated overheads associated with the supply constraints that have introduced a number of factory inefficiencies this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 8 shows our forecast for the Small Ag &amp; Turf segment. We now expect fiscal year \u201822 net sales to be up in the range of 10% to 15%. This guidance includes over 9 points of positive price realization, partially offset by 3 points of unfavorable currency impact. The segment\u2019s operating margin is now forecasted between 14% and 15%. The margin guidance reflects higher material costs and lower expectations for volume as small engine availability has been especially challenging. Price/cost remains neutral for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Changing to Construction &amp; Forestry on slide 9. For the quarter, net sales of $3.269 billion were up 8% due to price realization. Operating profit increased year-over-year to $514 million, resulting in a 16% operating margin. Favorable price realization offset higher production costs during the quarter. The production costs were mainly a result of elevated material and freight as well as higher overhead spend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, let\u2019s take a look at our 2022 Construction &amp; Forestry industry outlook on slide 10. Industry sales of earthmoving equipment in North America are expected to be up approximately 10%, while the compact construction market is forecasted to be flat to down 5%. Though demand remains strong for compact construction products, the downward revision reflects extremely low levels of inventory and supply challenges constraining shipments. End markets for earthmoving are expected to remain strong as oil and gas activities remain steady, U.S. infrastructure spend begins to ramp and CapEx programs from the independent rental companies drive re-fleeting efforts. Housing starts have moderated though still remain elevated versus historical levels. Additionally, record low levels of new and used equipment will dampen any slowdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In forestry, we now expect the industry to be flat to down 5%, primarily due to supply constraining the ability to meet demand. Global road-building markets are expected to be flat to up 5%. Road building demand remains strongest in the Americas while China and Russia markets are down significantly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The C&amp;F segment is on slide 11. Deere\u2019s Construction &amp; Forestry 2022 net sales are forecasted to be up around 10%. Our net sales guidance for the year includes about 10 points of positive price realization and 3 points of negative currency impact. The segment\u2019s operating margin outlook remains at a range of 15.5% to 16.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shifting over to our Financial Services operations on slide 12. Worldwide Financial Services net income attributable to Deere &amp; Company in the third quarter was $209 million. This is a slight decrease compared to the third quarter last year due to unfavorable discrete income tax adjustments, a higher provision for credit losses and lower gains on operating lease residual values. These were partially offset by income earned on a higher average portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For fiscal year \u201822, we maintain our net income outlook at $870 million, slightly lower than fiscal year \u201821 due to a higher provision for credit losses, less favorable financing spreads and higher SA&amp;G. The higher provisions for credit losses are primarily related to Russia. The segment is expected to continue to benefit from income earned on higher average portfolio balance. Overall, Financial Services continues to deliver steady results. Credit loss provisions, lease return rates and past dues are all in good shape, reflecting the solid balance sheet for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 13 outlines our guidance for net income, our effective tax rate and operating cash flow. For fiscal year \u201822, we adjusted our outlook for net income to be between $7 billion and $7.2 billion. The full year forecast is inclusive of the impact of higher raw material prices, higher logistics costs and production inefficiencies caused by supply disruptions. Our forecasted price realization is expected to outpace both material and freight costs for the entire year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving on to tax. Our guidance incorporates an effective tax rate projected to be between 21% 23%. Lastly, cash flow from the equipment operations is now expected to be in the range of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion. The decrease reflects the adjusted income forecast and increases in working capital required through the end of the fiscal year as we expect to maintain higher production levels heading into the first quarter of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this time, let\u2019s discuss a few topics for the quarter in more detail. First, I would like to take a closer look at Production &amp; Precision Ag\u2019s third quarter results, an impressive jump in net sales, both compared to the third quarter last year as well as compared to the second quarter this year. Net sales were up 43% year-over-year and up 19% sequentially, which is not our typical seasonality. Cory, can you talk through some of the factors that enabled us to achieve that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks, Rachel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s really several contributing factors this quarter. First is higher production rates. If you look back at the first half of this year, we had a work stoppage in the first quarter and had to ramp up at several of our largest U.S. factories. We also had two new product introductions, the 9R 4wd drive tractor and the X9 combine. During the third quarter, we ramped up and we achieved our highest production line rates yet this year, across several large ag factories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, as we started to ramp up through the second quarter, we continued to experience supply challenges, resulting in higher partially completed machines in inventory. We\u2019ve procured the needed parts and made good progress in both, finishing and shipping machines, reducing the number of partially completed machines in inventory. Now we did see overall inventories build slightly again in the third quarter, but that was mostly attributable to higher levels of raw inventory as we expect to maintain higher production rates, both through the fourth quarter and into Q1 of \u201823, which is different from our typical production wind down in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s important to note, we\u2019re focused on not adding more partially completed machines to inventory. We\u2019re making progress completing that inventory and getting it delivered to our dealers and customers. We\u2019ve also been able to increase our parts inventory, which is helping us as we go into the fall to support our customers and their operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Going back to the higher production rates and even the partially completed inventory, we\u2019re seeing some modest improvement in the supply base, but overall, it\u2019s still very fragile and deliveries are still choppy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. That\u2019s right. We continue to prioritize getting equipment out to our customers. While past due deliveries from suppliers have declined a bit, they\u2019re still at elevated levels. Missing parts and late part deliveries result in rework to complete partially built machines and contribute to production inefficiencies and higher overhead costs. We\u2019re able to achieve the higher line rates despite the continued difficulties and constraints within the supply chain. We\u2019re proactively working with our supply base to obtain allocations and improve on-time deliveries of parts, looking for opportunities to dual-source or providing resources to address constraints. Again, also we can get equipment out to our dealers and customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Josh Jepsen</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This is Josh. Maybe one thing to add. As Cory mentioned, we\u2019ve been focused on producing at higher levels in order to get products to customers, which has resulted in higher costs related to supply availability, inflationary pressures, overhead inefficiencies. So, maybe for example, we\u2019ve incurred expedited freight and experienced production inefficiencies. Expedited freight comes at a premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And any time we have to touch machines or move them in our factories more than once, it comes at a cost. In that respect, 2022 has been a challenge, given the ramp in demand juxtaposed with the lost production in the first quarter and a challenging supply environment. So, we\u2019ve really been chasing production all year as a result.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Importantly, we\u2019re seeing the benefit of getting those products in the hands of our customers, reflected in market share and retail statistics. So, we feel like we\u2019re broadly outperforming the industry. As we look forward, we\u2019ll build at higher levels of production in Q4 and into 1Q \u201823, which will help with our inefficiencies while also taking actions on costs that we\u2019ve incurred over the last few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. All good points, Josh. You both now mentioned higher production rates achieved during the third quarter are expected to carry forward. It\u2019s too early to guide for fiscal year 2023 but let\u2019s spend a little more time there. Cory, can you share some insights from our customers\u2019 perspective to provide some context as we look ahead?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Overall, ag fundamentals remain really strong. Corn and soy prices have declined from a few months ago, but so of inputs like fertilizer and others. Also when you look at global stocks to use, it\u2019s tight and it\u2019s expected to decline again, continuing to support elevated crop prices. May also take a couple of seasons to recover those grain stocks to normal levels. So, while profitability may come in a bit from record \u201822 levels, our customers will still be profitable, and the environment is supportive of replacement demand, especially when you consider that farmers haven\u2019t been able to replenish their fleets as much as they wanted to this year. The age of the fleet remains above average. Additionally, dealer inventories remain at historic lows since the industry shorted demand the last couple of years due to supply constraints. These factors should help extend the duration of the replacement cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And how has that been factoring into our crop care early order book that opened in June, so sprayers and planters?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you may recall from last year, we basically filled the full year production in the first phase of the EOP. We didn\u2019t do a second or third phase like we\u2019ve done in the past. Then with the work stoppage and supply challenges, we\u2019ve delivered a portion of those orders after their seasonal use this year. So, this year\u2019s program is structured differently with two phases, both of which are on allocation. These phases are only intended to source orders for pre-seasonal use deliveries. We\u2019ll run yet another phase later for post-seasonal shipments. So, year-over-year, EOP results won\u2019t be comparable due to the different structures we\u2019re running this year versus last.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And how about tractors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re also sold ahead on tractors well into the second quarter next year. And our new and used inventories for all large tractors are sitting at multiyear lows with products like the 9R tractor going through both, the work stoppage and new product transition, the momentum for all large tractors coming out of the third quarter on production rates will carry forward through the fourth quarter and well into next year. Demand is strong and still outstripping supply in 2023. Bottom line, we fully expect to produce more large ag equipment next year than we did this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Norwood</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. And let me add that these expectations around higher production rates are reflected in our revised cash flow outlook for this year, which we lowered a little bit due to increased working capital. We don\u2019t plan to see our normal seasonal reduction in inventory. And to help offset some of the supply challenges and maintain the higher production rates through the fourth quarter and into the next year, we\u2019re carrying a little bit more raw inventory, heading out of 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Brent. That is important to note. The inventory increases are not replacing partially completed inventory but increasing raw inventory as we prepare for that continued higher production rates. This is different than what we\u2019ve seen seasonally in the past. So Cory, before we move on, what are we seeing on take rates in the model year \u201823 early order programs?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It\u2019s good across the board. Customers are seeing the value and technology and the advanced solutions that we\u2019re offering. We saw increases in take rates for ExactEmerge on our planners to nearly 60%, and ExactApply for sprayers jumped over 10 points to 65% take rate. Tech products like our premium activations for tractors and sprayers are nearing 100% adoption by our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, I\u2019d like to spend some time on the industry outlook. U.S. and Canada large ag is projected to be up about 10 -- about 15% on a unit basis. It\u2019s been a common theme across the industry. AEM retail data is choppy month-to-month and byproduct and impacted by when the products are able to get shipped so less reflective of demand right now. Our model year \u201823 order books reflect that, too. Demand has remained resilient as ag fundamentals remained positive. We\u2019ve been able to ship more product in the third quarter and are forecasting to outpace the industry for full year, indicating some market share gains in the U.S. and Canada large ag space. Cory, what about Europe?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Europe is another region where demand continues to outpace what the industry can supply. The industry has seen a lot of production challenges in Europe due to supply chain issues, geopolitical events and other disruptions as well. It\u2019s the same story of partially completed machines waiting for parts or even, in some cases, completed machines just waiting on an outbound truck. For us though, despite all of that, Europe has remained a bright spot. The team has executed really well, we\u2019ve been outperforming the industry. So, we\u2019re on track to grow high horsepower tractor, combine and SPFH share there as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what about South America?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Cory Reed</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re seeing strong profitability for our customers and strong market demand, which has outpaced industry production in 2022, particularly in Brazil, where we\u2019re releasing production monthly to maintain tight controls between inflation and pricing. And we\u2019re seeing our calendars fill up within hours of releasing them. We fully expect this strong demand cycle in Brazil will continue in 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On top of that, our precision ag engagement in the region also continues to accelerate. South America is experiencing the fastest growth in engaged acres of anywhere in the world. And technologies such as ExactEmerge are accelerating across the region. Historically, we\u2019ve had an objective to put South American profitability on par with Region 4. We\u2019re now meeting and exceeding that goal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thanks, Cory. I think that\u2019s helpful insight to how our net sales guides reconcile to the industry guides. Our net sales guide includes not only higher price but also stronger volumes and higher take rates of precision ag solutions. Brent, what about Small Ag &amp; Turf? The industry is expected to be flat compared to our net sales guide of up 10% to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Norwood</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I think we really need to parse it out a little bit. If we look at the parts of our business that are linked to the ag economy like midsized tractors versus consumer products like compact utility tractors, there\u2019s different stories going on there. First, with midsized tractors linked more to hay and forage markets, livestock and dairy margins, they\u2019ve all remained pretty steady. High protein and dairy prices have helped offset some of the higher feed and input costs that we\u2019re seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we do see continued demand for our products like the 6 Series tractors, and this is a positive contributor in terms of our mix for Small Ag &amp; Turf. On the other hand, consumer products are beginning to soften as they are more closely linked to the general economy. So, equipment inventory -- so while equipment inventories remain well below normal levels, they\u2019re starting to see a rise a little bit for small tractors. So, we\u2019re monitoring these inventory levels closely. But restocking the channel should moderate slowing in the retail demand that we\u2019re seeing, especially in Turf, which hasn\u2019t seen much of any increase in inventories just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. I touched on C&amp;S industry outlook earlier. Josh, anything to add for C&amp;S?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Josh Jepsen</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. In North America, while we\u2019re seeing indicators of housing moderate a bit, earthmoving and road building are helped by steady oil and gas, and the U.S. infrastructure beginning to ramp up. In fact, in North America, it\u2019s really been a bright spot for road building. China and Russia are down for road building, and we\u2019re beginning to see some softening in Europe, but North America is offsetting much of that. And that mix is contributing to some really good margins for road building, which are the best we\u2019ve seen since the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Rachel Bach</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Josh. Raj, before we transition to the Q&amp;A portion, any summary comments?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Raj Kalathur</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, Rachel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few thanks. First, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary efforts by our production and operations employees to ramp up factory output while finishing and shipping a portion of the partially completed inventory while continuing to manage through supply challenges. The dedication to getting products to our customers is just phenomenal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, through the third quarter, we continued to see elevated costs and production inefficiencies, but we also demonstrated higher line rates and those rates will continue through the fourth quarter and into next fiscal year to meet customer demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Next, I want to highlight the 1.2 billion [Technical Difficulty] shares we repurchased during the third quarter. It\u2019s a testament to our use of cash philosophy. We will continue to be proactive with buybacks and opportunistic with volatility in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look ahead, we plan to continue the momentum we built during the third quarter, into the fourth quarter and beyond, which continue to be dependent on supply chain performance. As Josh mentioned, we are taking steps to reduce the impact of a persistently volatile supply chain, allowing us to focus on improving production inefficiencies and managing material costs as we pivot to 2023. Demand remains strong in multiple end markets, and we continue to see strong demand for our technologies and precision solutions. Finally, through our smart industrial strategy and execution of our leap ambitions, we will continue to unlock more value for our customers, leaving our best years still to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Norwood</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, we are ready to begin the Q&amp;A portion of the call. The operator will instruct you on the polling procedure. In consideration of others and our hope to allow more of you to participate in the call, please limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you rejoin the queue. Operator?</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tim Thein</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s good discussion in terms of the line rights and the build plans in the near term for large ag. Can we maybe just think about or talk a bit about what pricing may look like, obviously, coming from a high base this year? But given what\u2019s already been announced in the spring EOP and then some of the model year tractor increases that you\u2019ve announced, maybe just share some high-level thoughts around the pricing for PPA? I know a lot goes into that equation but maybe just some framework to help us think about the pricing opportunity for \u201823. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Regarding pricing for 2023, it\u2019s still a little bit early. We don\u2019t have a formal price realization guide out there. We do have some early order programs and some rolling order books that are extending well into next year, so we do have some list prices out there. For large ag, we\u2019re seeing list price increases in the high single digits to low double digits, depending a bit on the product line. Moving to Construction &amp; Forestry, we\u2019re looking at more kind of mid- to high single digits in terms of list price increases year-over-year. As I noted, it\u2019s still early and those aren\u2019t to be confused with price realization forecasts for \u201823, but at least that\u2019s how our order books are shaping out at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Tami Zakaria with JPMorgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tami Zakaria</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, looking at the Production &amp; Precision Ag segment, it seems like you\u2019re expecting sequential sales growth, call it, in the mid-single-digit range, sequentially in the fourth quarter, but the operating profit seems to be growing around 30% sequentially to get to your full year guide. So, can you help us understand what would be driving this high incremental margin of about 50% in the segment in the fourth quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sure. Thanks, Tami, for the question. With respect to our fourth quarter implied guide, I think there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in there. We will see some of our best cost comparison a year come in the fourth quarter, I think. Up until this point, the cost comparisons relative to last year have been more difficult. We\u2019ll start to see that abate a little bit as we anniversary some of the inflation that we began to see come in, in the third and fourth quarter last year. Incrementally, price is going to get a little bit better in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s going to help as well. And we will see a slight increase in line rates, even from the third quarter. So, between price, volume and anniversarying some of the cost inflation that we saw last year, that does point to a higher margin profile for us in the fourth quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Kristen Owen with Oppenheimer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Kristen Owen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If we think about some of the longer term contracts that you\u2019ve talked about on the supply side, clearly, today, that\u2019s oriented around getting priority on components. But I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about the margin impact of those contracts on a go-forward basis. If we were to start to see supply chains normalize, how would that influence your long-term margin outlook? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding this supply chain, there\u2019s -- I mean, there are really a myriad of things that we are working on proactively to manage the supply base. Kristen, you named one of many levers that we\u2019re pulling. For some, certain critical components, we have signed some long-term contracts. I would say for other parts of the supply base, we\u2019re working on other strategies as well; dual-sourcing, also a very viable strategy for us in the short and midterm. For some of our suppliers, we\u2019re investing in additional machinery capacity. So, it\u2019s really a multipronged approach for us and requiring a lot of day-to-day management. And we do foresee that day-to-day management of supply chain continuing really for the foreseeable future. And so -- but with respect to the long-term contracts, as you noted, we\u2019re very mindful of the prices that we\u2019re committing to and the volumes that we\u2019re underwriting. And like I said, we\u2019ve really limited that to the parts of supply base that are critical and where most necessary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Kristen, this is Josh. Maybe one thing to add. I mean, those types of things are also contemplated as we think about how we\u2019re pricing for the upcoming year. So, those are definitely part of the equation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Kristen, this is Cory. The only thing I would add is if you think about the third quarter, what we\u2019ve been doing is we\u2019ve been getting the supply base to prove out that it can perform at the line rates we have, in addition, put additional material that allows us to clean up some of that unfinished inventory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we look at our production schedules going forward, that gives us higher confidence that we\u2019re going to be able to run those line levels consistently and into the first quarter. That gives us a tremendous amount of confidence in how we think about all the additional costs that go into securing, expediting, all the things that happened that result -- rework that results in a drag on margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jamie Cook</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Understanding inventory was -- and welcome back, Raj, to the earnings calls. But understanding inventories were higher more so because of raw, can you help us understand how much of the $1 billion of unfinished products we got out the door from second quarter, so what\u2019s in Q3 versus Q4? And then, your commentary on production into 2021, the first quarter being strong, it\u2019s interesting. Wondering if we should assume, obviously, production at high levels all year like from the first quarter run rate basis and whether you expect to fill a replenished channel inventory in 2023? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I\u2019ll start on the inventory question. The increase in inventory that we saw sequentially from the second quarter was really more raw, as we noted, a little less WIP and more parts inventory as well. And I think -- and that reflects our strategy to continue with kind of high line rates coming out of the fourth quarter, so it\u2019s really a sign of a positive outlook for next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to the level of -- or the number of partially completed machines that we have coming out of the second quarter, we made great progress on reducing the number of machines. Roughly about a third, we were able to work through over the third quarter, which will leave us with some inventory left for next quarter. Importantly, the number of machines that we still have held as partially completed inventory, for the most part, we\u2019re looking at machines that only need one or two parts before they\u2019re ready to ship and retail to customers. So, for the machines that needed more significant rework, those were some of the machines that we worked our way through in the third quarter, which gives us a little more confidence as we look at fourth quarter line rates and our revenue guide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. I would say -- and Brent hit it, I mean if you look, we were averaging -- those machines that were coming off, first of all, we\u2019re taking them down, taking that inventory that\u2019s unfinished down. We also are averaging, in many cases, 10 to 12 run without. So part -- significant parts that would have to be reworked, we\u2019re now down in low single digits in many of them, just one part that\u2019s waiting or just one set of tires that\u2019s waiting. So, significant progress, both in the number but also the amount of rework remaining on machines to ship. The other thing you asked about the first, you think about we actually were shut down at the front end based on what happened with our strike. And ultimately, this year, we just keep producing right through. We finish our \u201822 builds and go right into \u201823.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Dillon Cumming with Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Dillon Cumming</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Really great to hear the uptake commentary from Cory with regards to the ExactApply, ExactEmerge uptake. Just curious if you can comment on See &amp; Spray integration, whether or not you\u2019ve been able to commercialize that more fully in the EOP rollout this year? And if you have, what level of kind of volume outlook is for next year as well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to See &amp; Spray, this was our first year to commercialize it. We did so on a limited basis. 2023 will be our final year of limited production there. We want to make sure that we get it right, that we really calibrate on the right spec level and make sure that we\u2019re tooled up in the factory to go full production in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019ve actually learned quite a bit over the course of this limited production season. We\u2019ve really learned what it takes to ensure that our customers are getting the outcomes that they expect when they use the tool. We\u2019ve learned a lot about the acceptance of the per acre business model. And we\u2019ll be a little bit smarter as we head into next year and a little more dialed in with respect to the pricing and structure of our \u201823 offering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think Brent hit it well. Just to add, the big part of this was getting the product in the hands and really seeing customer value being driven by how they use the product. We can deliver all the technology. We have to see how they\u2019re going to use it to help improve the outcomes, be able to do it, do more acres, do it with less material, improve their profitability and all of that\u2019s proving out. So, we\u2019re sitting well as we go into the next limited production year, and then we\u2019ll open up and start delivering even more going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. Your may ask your question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Seth Weber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wanted to ask about Europe. I guess, I was a little surprised that you\u2019re -- it sounds like you\u2019re still seeing Europe to be kind of hanging in flattish. I think you said demand was actually still pretty good there on the ag side. I mean, can you -- just given what\u2019s going on with the drought and just geopolitical stuff, can you just give us some additional color on what you\u2019re seeing maybe by some of the countries across Europe or just what you think is sustaining Europe farmer sentiment at this point? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Thanks for the question. Regarding Europe, some of the flat retail data that you\u2019re seeing year-to-date is really a reflection of inability for the industry to get supply out there. I know there\u2019s been a lot of discrete issues with a lot of industry players this year in terms of production capabilities. We are seeing the overall market as remaining strong and steady. There is definitely differing weather patterns depending on what part of Europe we\u2019re talking about. The Central Europe is faring a little bit better than Western Europe a little bit. But overall, elevated wheat prices are largely offsetting some of the surging input prices that they\u2019ve seen. Arable margins, the outlook will remain supportive for the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we pivot into the dairy and livestock sector there, fiscal year \u201822 margins were really better than expected from elevated dairy prices. Maybe a little bit of risk there on dairy margins going into next year, but overall, we\u2019ve seen that market remain pretty steady. And again, the flat outlook for the year is really a reflection of production capabilities more so than any demand concerns that we have at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. This is Josh. I think one thing to continue to highlight there is we shifted our strategy a few years ago. We\u2019re much more focused on where we can differentiate through technology in Production &amp; Precision Ag in particular and in the markets where that really speaks to driving value to customers. And so, we\u2019re seeing a continuation, really, a third year of market share gains on high horsepower tractors. This year, we\u2019re seeing good movement in terms of share on combines. So, the work that the team is doing from a strategic point of view as well as a lot of really good work with the dealer channel and focusing there is driving a lot of positive results for us. Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Rob Wertheimer</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I had a short-term and a long-term question on R&amp;D. The cadence of R&amp;D ticked up in the quarter in the back half of the year. I\u2019m wondering what happened to just shift your view on what needed to be spent. And then, in general, I think you\u2019ve gotten pretty good efficiency in R&amp;D over the past couple of years. I\u2019m wondering if the uptick in spending is an indication at the end of the road on that or new programs or if you just have general comments. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Rob, thanks for the question. Regarding R&amp;D for the year, we saw it tick up a little bit in the guidance and that really reflects just our ability to accelerate some projects faster than we had originally anticipated. So I think that\u2019s a positive note. I think longer term, the neighborhood that we\u2019re traveling in right now on R&amp;D spend is about right, plus or minus 10% on maybe any given year. But the big step function change that we\u2019ve seen this year, I think, really puts us in the right spot to execute on our leap ambitions and other targets for production precision ag and the other divisions as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Rob, it\u2019s Josh. Brent summed it up well. I think the continued focus in these areas where we feel like we can really differentiate and accelerate development of solutions that are going to unlock value and also be leverageable across our different businesses. So, whether that\u2019s digitalization, electrification, automation and autonomy, those are the areas where we\u2019re seeing the biggest opportunities and where as we can and as we particularly bring on new talent, whether it\u2019s the acquisition or other, we\u2019re accelerating development in those spaces.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Jerry Revich</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about the guidance revision. So, nice to see pricing accelerating and with the production costs, we\u2019ve got margins coming down. So, as we look at the impact of the inefficiencies, Josh, that you spoke about, it looks like based on the revision to guidance, there\u2019s about an $800 million incremental cost headwind versus three months ago. Is that all the inefficiencies of waiting for parts and moving machines around, or how much of that is other incremental inflation as we think about what that picture looks like when things normalize? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Jerry, I think there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to the guidance in the back half of the quarter. I mean, really, what we saw in terms of the lowered guidance primarily related to increased material cost, freight and then excess overhead, which is coming from those supply disruptions that Josh noted about earlier. I mean, there\u2019s really a myriad of issues that affects that. Line rates may differ day-to-day. It makes it hard to optimize the workforce. We are doing more rework on partially completed machines, and that creates a lot of increased overhead. So, those are really the primary factors that drove the guidance change for us in the back half of the year. We\u2019re already starting to think about what the cost structure will look like as we exit the year and start making plans and build rates and schedules for the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Jerry, this is Cory. Maybe I\u2019ll just use an example for you to give you an idea of how it\u2019s impacted us. If you took two of our largest units, Harvester Works and Waterloo, and you looked at the average over three years from \u201818 to \u201820 of what they spent in premium freight alone, so this is expedited freight and air freight, they\u2019d spend combined about $25 million. We\u2019re probably going to spend almost $200 million this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, we made a conscious decision that we wanted to drive customers to get their products as close to on-time as we could. So, we went to extraordinary efforts. That extraordinary number should not be there at the same level going forward. So, our opportunity is we made the decision to spend to be able to fulfill customer demand. And it\u2019s shown up in what we\u2019ve been able to ship. It will show up in our market share. But we need to drive -- our drive is to get that back out going forward as we get to more normalized production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">David Raso</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I mean, I can ask a lot of detailed questions, but I guess just stepping back, you\u2019re implying the fourth quarter earnings are about $7.25, $7.30. And then the most interesting thing I mean you\u2019ve said is the lack of seasonality, right? Usually, the first quarter is a bit of a low quarter. It sounds like that\u2019s not the case. So, I guess just to level set everybody, just trying to think to the pros and cons. When we look at that fourth quarter, I can\u2019t just multiply it by 4 to say that\u2019s an annualized rate. But given the lack of seasonality you\u2019re talking about, there might be a better chance than normal to annualize that number. So, can you help us a little bit with the pros and cons, thinking about that fourth quarter number? Number one, is there something unique in that number that\u2019s making it that strong?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then, for \u201823, I mean, the pros and cons would be obviously the pro would be hopefully more efficient production, just given some weaker parts of the economy, a little better improvement in chip availability. But then, the cons might be just macro risk around Small Ag, maybe late in the year, Construction, we\u2019ll see. But obviously, you\u2019re speaking constructively about big ag for most of \u201823. So, can you just help level set big picture of that fourth quarter number, something unique in it, and how to think about roughly annualizing that number? Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, David. Thanks for the question. As we think about the fourth quarter, it will not follow our typical seasonal pattern, as you pointed out. We do end up year-over-year with about 20% more production days in our large ag factories in North America. So that\u2019s really going to help us as we think about achieving our guidance for the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do still have some number of partially completed machines with good line of sight to clearing many of those over the fourth quarter. And then, we are -- we do intend to take our line rates just a click higher from where we did -- what we produced in the third quarter. Now, most of the increase in line rate did happen in the third quarter, but we\u2019re going to go even a stretch higher in the fourth quarter. So, it is going to give us a very different profile coming out of the year than maybe what you\u2019ve typically expected or typically seen us do in years past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey David, it\u2019s Josh. As Brent mentioned, typical seasonality would see us come down in 4Q because we\u2019re not, for example, building and shipping combines to the extent we will this year, and then a slower ramp in 1Q. Last year clearly impacted by going through a work stoppage. So, year-over-year, we\u2019re going to see those benefits as we get into the first quarter and build at those higher rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now, that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s going to be perfectly linear, but we are entering the year at much higher production rates. And given the demand we see, that is covering a decent part of the first part of the year -- first portion of the year is helpful. And that\u2019s -- with EOP, a lot of visibility there with our other products like large tractors, but then it extends into other things, like our mid-series tractors where we\u2019ve got visibility to what we\u2019d expect to be at least a third of next year already covered up. And we\u2019re seeing strong order activity in Brazil as well. So, too early to have a full view or perspective on \u201823, but I think the takeaway is we feel really good about how we\u2019re going to exit 4Q into 1Q with strong demand and the ability to drive more efficiencies in our operation while beginning to look at our costs and take out some of those costs that Cory mentioned earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Fisher</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a bigger picture question on the ag cycle and your inventory planning. I didn\u2019t quite hear the answer as part of Jamie\u2019s question. But how are you deciding how much and when to restock dealer inventories for both, large and small ag? It seems like maybe small could be a little more complicated decision-making, giving the divergence of what you talked about between the dairy products and the consumer. So, just curious how you\u2019re thinking about the restocking and when and how much. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Steven, thanks for the question. Large ag inventory, we won\u2019t see much of any build this year. Effectively everything that we are shipping from our factories is already retail sold. In our data in the slide deck, you\u2019ll see a slight uptick in dealer inventories. That\u2019s just reflective of the higher build rates and the higher throughput that we\u2019re pushing through into the system. It\u2019s not really a reflection of any sort of restocking that\u2019s happening on the large ag side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think going into next year, maybe too early to tell where we end. But right now, we are still on allocation, which implies demand still running a little bit ahead of supply. In that scenario, we wouldn\u2019t expect to build a lot of inventory, if any, next year. So, it\u2019s still, again, a little early, but at least from where we sit today, probably limited ability to build inventory on the large ag side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The calculus in small ag is maybe a little bit different. Probably still going to be very tight with your midsized equipment that\u2019s going into the hay and forage, and dairy and livestock sectors, while some of the more consumer-driven products, turf and compact utility drivers, may see demand moderate a little bit as we go through the year. Now, that said, we\u2019re starting from pretty low inventories. So, there may be some ability to build a little bit of inventory there. But we\u2019re going to be really careful and watch demand very, very closely so that we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves in terms of inventory to sales ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Steven, this is Cory. We\u2019re sitting at all-time lows. We\u2019re in the low teens in new and used. The teens that you see show up in dealer inventory are largely pipeline that are moving through to customers. Used inventory across the board for large ag equipment is all-time low, so. And if you look at how across the board at least returns coming back, no one\u2019s sending any back. I mean, we\u2019re in a really good spot, and we\u2019re not going to really build any inventory even through \u201823.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Stephen Volkmann</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My question is about input cost because it looks like, at least from an index perspective, whether it\u2019s metals, rubber, energy in the U.S., transportation and logistics, I mean, all these costs seem to be rolling over pretty significantly. And so, I\u2019m wondering, are you starting to see that in some of this inventory build that you\u2019re doing, or if not, sort of how should we think about that sort of ultimately starting to work its way through your cost structure? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Steve, thanks for the question. Regarding input prices, I think there are a few different categories of cost at play in 2022. Some of the cost increases that we\u2019ve experienced are going to be a little more structural and higher for longer. Things like labor and energy are parts of the supply base where they\u2019re truly capacity constrained, right. The supply and demand dynamics for those parts of the supply base will likely keep prices higher going into \u201823.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That said, there are going to be some opportunities, I think, for costs to abate a little bit. There\u2019s been, in 2022, significant additional costs stemming from supply disruptions. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about that as we exit this year with higher production rates, should ease a little bit of the overhead pressure going into next year. And then, there\u2019s other parts of our supply base that are linked to raw material prices, like steel, and others in that commodity basket that have come down a little bit. And I think those are all going to be opportunities for cost reductions in \u201823 as we go through the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Chad Dillard with Bernstein.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chad Dillard</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, a couple of questions for you. First of all, in your prepared remarks, you talked about share gains. So, I just want to get a better understanding of which products you\u2019re seeing share gains, and if you can particularly quantify how much you\u2019re seeing? And I guess, like more importantly, as you\u2019re thinking about the gains, to what extent do you think they\u2019re more cyclical versus structural? And then, second question is just about your margins in Production &amp; Precision Ag. It looks like the implied exit rate is about 25%. Is that a right number to kind of start thinking about in 2023?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey Chad, a couple of questions in there. I\u2019ll try to work my way through those. With respect to share this year, we -- for the most part, we view share as a function of which players are able to produce machines. There is a shortage of equipment. There\u2019s not a lot of inventory available. And so, the areas where we\u2019ve had the best execution on our part, I would call out Mannheim tractors first and also Waterloo row crop tractors have been areas of strength for us as we\u2019ve progressed through the year. And we continue to see and forecast good production rates, exiting this year and going into \u201823 for both of those product lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of margin for \u201823, I would say it\u2019s too early for us to have a guide. There\u2019s going to be a lot of variables as we exit \u201822 and go into \u201823. We\u2019ve got new pricing for model year \u201823 products. There\u2019s certainly a lot of volatility in our cost structure as parts of that are coming in a little bit but other parts are remaining stubbornly high. So, no real guidance on what to expect, I would say, for margins other than we would target incrementals pretty consistent -- going into \u201823, we would target incrementals that would be consistent with what you\u2019ve come to expect at Deere. Ag &amp; Turf products typically in the 30% to 35% range, and Construction &amp; Forestry products historically have been in the 20% to 25% range, and that would be our targeting goal as we think about 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Chad, it\u2019s Cory. The only thing I\u2019d add on the share side, I mean, probably the thing we talk about large tractors, which we continue to be able to consistently perform and deliver. I\u2019m probably most excited about the share gains we see in sprayers and planters. These are the instruments of precision ag technology. These are the things that deliver on our strategy for smart industrial, the ability to take new technologies out that help us -- help customers do better, grow more yield, do it with less cost. And we\u2019re consistently moving share into the market with those. And I\u2019d remind you, if you look at those numbers, things like sprayers, we\u2019re actually shipping late this year and continuing to build share in planters. We\u2019re shipping a lot of products later than expected and continuing to build share. So, those primary instruments of our strategy, we\u2019re growing share on consistently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. It\u2019s Josh. One thing on share to point out too is, well, as Brent mentioned rightfully so, ability to ship is impacting month-on-month how we\u2019re seeing share performance. At the root, we\u2019re seeing share gains where we\u2019re converting customers, and that is a precision ag story. The value that we can create with our dealer network, with our solutions and tools is converting customers. Now, you might not see that show up exactly in a month-to-month market share number. But that\u2019s the big opportunity we have, and we see those conversions as a result of the value we can deliver to them and how we can do that seamlessly and easier to drive those outcomes, whether it be financial, productivity or from a sustainable point of view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Feniger</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the past, you have said the cycle peak is typically at 120% to 140% of mid-cycle. I think you\u2019ve calculated that on a seven-year rolling average. I\u2019m just curious, based on that framework and your expectations for 2023 to be up, where you think that large ag is going to finish next year, given that framework?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. Hey Mike, this is Brent. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s probably a little too early at this point to predict where in the cycle, or what our math will calculate for 2023. Keep in mind, we\u2019re still on allocation for 2023. So, that is implying there\u2019s still some level of unmet demand. And certainly, it\u2019s way too early at this point to call what will happen after 2023. So, I think the important elements that we\u2019re focused on right now is customer fundamentals are still really strong. And while we will increase volumes next year, and we may even begin to bring down the age of the fleet for tractors a little bit, we\u2019re still going to be at pretty elevated levels there. And as Cory noted, inventory levels are at record low. So, these are all the things that we\u2019re contemplating as we plan our schedules for \u201823 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And for us, these factors tend to point to a bit of a longer duration in the cycle, which makes it really difficult to compare from one cycle to the next, because they\u2019re all a little different. But these are the factors that we\u2019re focused on and I think will drive our business in the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Josh Jepsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think importantly -- this is Josh. Importantly, as we go forward, as we talked about in May at our Investor Day is, how do we continue to build a business that\u2019s more resilient, that has less volatility through the cycle. And we\u2019re in the early stages of that, but we feel confident in the ability, over time, to do that. And that\u2019s a continued focus of how do we reduce that volatility that we\u2019ve seen historically moving up and down in the cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Cory Reed</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The only other thing I would add to that, this is Cory, is we tend to talk a lot about the North American market. We have the very same dynamics in the South American market. Our team is out, they\u2019re one of the largest customers there. They\u2019re getting ready for their planting season for next year. They\u2019re likely going to plant the largest crop in the history of the region. We\u2019re seeing our shares grow and we\u2019re seeing our precision ag technology rates grow. We\u2019re putting the connectivity, the engaged acres. So, it bodes well for the future for that region as well, which I think is worth noting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think, we\u2019ve got time for one last caller.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our last question comes from John Joyner with BMO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">John Joyner</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I had another question on planned inventory levels, exiting the year. And maybe you touched on this already, but how much of it is from production rates set to improve simply from supply chain and freight challenges easing versus what it says about how you perceive demand, I guess, today, heading into fiscal \u201823 compared with what your assumptions were just a few months ago?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Brent Norwood</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes. John, thanks for the question. We would say that the primary driver of our inventory levels coming out of the fourth quarter and going into next year, it\u2019s really about the enthusiasm for the demand that we\u2019re seeing and our ability to carry these higher production rates into next year is going to require higher inventory levels for us. That\u2019s the primary driver more so than just carrying more inventory because of supply constraints. There could be a little bit of that in there. But that wasn\u2019t really the primary impetus for carrying more inventory coming out of the year. Thanks, John.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Brent Norwood</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019re out of time for the rest of the hour. So thank you, everybody, for calling in. We appreciate the questions, and we look forward to following up with everybody after the call. Thanks, all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.
