(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll begin by turning the conference over to Mr. Ted Detrick.</p> <p><strong>Ted Detrick</strong></p> <p>I am Ted Detrick, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me this morning are Ed Hanway, CIGNA's Chairman and CEO, David Cordani, President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Bell, CIGNA's Chief Financial Officer, and Marcia Dall, Financial Officer for CIGNA Health Care business.</p> <p>In our remarks today, Ed will begin by discussing highlights of CIGNA's second quarter results. Mike will then review the financial details of the quarter, and provide the financial outlook for full year 2008, he will also comment on our current view regarding 2009. David will discuss a number of topics including the actions we are taking to increase Health Care results in the second half of 2008. He will also comment on the integration status of our recent acquisition of the Great-West HealthCare business. Ed will make some concluding remarks and then we will open the lines for your questions. </p> <p>As noted in our earnings release, CIGNA uses certain financial measures, which are not determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, when describing its financial results. Specifically, we use the term labeled \"adjusted income from operations\" as the principal measure of performance for CIGNA in<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> our operating segments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Adjusted income from operations is defined as income from continuing operations, excluding realized investment results, special items, and the results of our guaranteed minimum income benefits business. A reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to income from continuing operations, which is the most directly<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> comparable GAAP measure, is contained in today's earnings release which was filed this morning on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is also posted in the Investor Relations section of CIGNA.com. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our remarks today we will be making some forward looking comments. We would remind you that there are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and those risk factors are discussed in today's earnings release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before I turn the call over to Ed, I will cover a few items pertaining to our second quarter results and disclosures. First, our second quarter results include the results of the Great-West Health Care business which we acquired on April 1, this year. In our second quarter 10-Q we will provide expanded disclosures regarding the acquisition of Great-West including pro-forma supplemental financial information as if the acquisition had closed on January 1, 2007.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, CIGNA\u2019s second quarter net income included an after-tax charge of $52 million related to a litigation matter concerning our pension plan. This charge is reported as a special item and therefore is excluded from adjusted income from operations in today\u2019s discussion of both our second quarter results and our full year 2008 outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, CIGNA\u2019s second quarter net income included after tax gains of $34 million or $0.12 per share related to the guaranteed minimum income benefits business otherwise known as GMIB which is reported in the run off re-insurance segment. Remember that CIGNA adopted financial accounting Standard 157 in the first quarter this year which impacts the measurement of fair value for the assets and liabilities of the GMIB business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would also remind you that the impact of Statement 157 reporting for our GMIB results if for GAAP accounting purposes only and does not represent the actual economics or cash flows of that business. Accordingly, the year to date after tax losses of $161 million from that business are non-cash charges and have no affect on our estimate for 2008 subsidiary dividends. Finally, as a reminder CIGNA\u2019s future results for the GMIB business will become more volatile as any future change in the exit value of the assets and liabilities of that business will be recorded in net income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">CIGNA\u2019s 2008 earnings outlook which Mike Bell will discuss in a few moment, excludes the results of the GMIB business and therefore any potential volatility related to the perspective applications of that Statement 157.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would like to remind you that CIGNA will be hosting its Annual Investor Day this year on November 1<sup>st</sup> in New York City. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Ed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ed Hanway</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our second quarter adjusted income from operations was $303 million or $1.08 per share. Our second quarter earnings improved from first quarter reflecting higher Health Care results and continued strong results from our Group Disability and Life and International businesses. These results demonstrate the strength of our diversified earnings streams which provide us with unique opportunities to grow profitably despite challenging economic conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On a year to date basis Health Care earnings were $319 million, with earnings improving by approximately $40 million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. Second quarter Health Care results were impacted by a number of factors including favorable operating expenses, increased contributions from our specialty businesses and strong earnings from the recently acquired Great-West business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Conversely the guaranteed cost book experienced lower membership driven by pricing discipline and lower new business sales and a higher medical cost ratio. We expect to see meaningfully improved Health Care earnings through the remainder of 2008, although the extent of the improvement will be less than previously expected. David will describe the actions we are taking to drive that improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Related to the Great-West acquisition our integration efforts to date are progressing well and consistent with our expectations. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 2008 and significantly accretive in 2009 and 2010.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I will now comment briefly our Group Disability and Life and International businesses. Our Group and International businesses delivered another strong quarter with competitively strong top line growth and profit margins. The first half of 2008 our Group business reported earnings of $141 million with premiums and fees growing year over year at an attractive rate of 10%. Our after tax margins in this business continued to be industry leading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our International business has reported year to date earnings of $100 million an increase of 22% compared to the first half of 2007, a growth in premium and fees of 12%. Overall, both our Group and International operations have good growth opportunities and strong market positions which we expect will enable them to continue to deliver good top line and bottom line growth over the next several years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to capital management, we resumed our share buy back program during the second quarter and repurchased 6.7 million shares or $264 million through July 31<sup>st</sup>. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding the full year 2008 outlook, we expect that earnings per share will be in the range of $4.05 to $4.25 per share which is consistent with our prior guidance. The outlook reflects higher second half Health Care earnings although the level of growth is less than previously expected, related to both the experience rated and guaranteed cost book. The outlook also reflects the positive impact of our year to date share repurchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike is now going to cover the specifics of the second quarter results and our 2008 outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In my remarks today I\u2019ll review CIGNA\u2019s second quarter 2008 results also provide an update on our full year outlook and I\u2019ll comment briefly on our early thinking for 2009. In my review of consolidated segment result I\u2019ll comment on adjusted income from operations, this is income from continuing operations excluding realized investment results, GMIB results and special items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our second quarter earnings were $303 million or $1.08 per share compared to $284 million or $0.98 per share in 2007. Our consolidated second quarter 2008 earnings improved relative to first quarter reflecting increased Health Care earnings and continued strong results in Group Disability and Life and International.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll review each of the segment results beginning with Health Care. Second quarter Health Care earnings were $181 million relative to first quarter this result reflected the benefit of lower operating expenses and an increased contribution from our specialty businesses. In addition, Great-West contributed $16 million of after tax earnings in second quarter excluding financing costs which are reflected in the corporate segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll discuss our Health Care results by major component. Guaranteed cost earnings declined sequentially mainly reflecting a higher than expected MLR and lower membership. Our guaranteed cost MLR the first half of 2008 was 84.8% excluding our voluntary business. This included approximately 50 basis points for flu related upper respiratory claims in the first quarter and higher than expected year to date catastrophic claims.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We currently expect our guaranteed cost MLR to improve to a range of 83% to 83.5% for the full year. This range is slightly higher than our previous estimate of 83% it reflects modestly higher expectations for medical trends due to the higher upper respiratory and catastrophic claims in the first half of the year. We expect the improvement in the MLR during the second half of the year to be driven primarily by renewal price increases that are higher than trend and the impact of additional underwriting actions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Excluding the non-medical account loss in first quarter our experience rated results improved sequentially but were below our expectations. The sequential improvement reflected a better medical loss ratio and more favorable operating expenses. Relative to our expectations we experienced a higher dollar amount of account level deficits in the second quarter than we had anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our ASO results were strong in the quarter driven by lower operating expenses and continued increase in the earnings contribution from our specialty products. Relative to operating expenses our second quarter earnings benefited by $16 million after tax due to lower expenses compared to the first quarter. Approximately half of the sequential improvement was due to items which we do not expect to repeat in the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With respect to medical costs there is no change in the full year medical trend outlook for our total book of business. We continue to expect medical cost trend for our total book to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% for full year 2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our medical membership was 12.1 million members as of June 30. This includes the impact of the acquisition of Great-West Health Care on April 1<sup>st</sup>. Excluding Great-West membership was 1% higher than at year end 2007. During the quarter our guaranteed cost membership declined by 2% and our ASO membership decreased by 1%. Our membership result reflects our continued focus on maintaining pricing discipline as well as the impact of higher dis-enrollment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Health Care premiums and fees increased 13% relative to second quarter 2007 primarily due the acquisition of Great-West HealthCare. Excluding Great-West premiums and fees were flat reflecting rate increases in our guaranteed cost and experience rated businesses and higher specialty revenue offset primarily by a decline in guaranteed cost membership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll discuss the results of our other segments. Second quarter 2008 earnings in our Group Disability and Life were $73 million. This result includes an $8 million favorable impact from a disability reserve study. Earnings in the quarter primarily reflected attractive margins, revenue growth and continued strong disability management results partly offset by a less favorable life claims experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our International segment, second quarter 2008 earnings of $48 million reflected continued growth and competitively strong margins in our Life Accident Supplemental Health and expatriate benefits businesses. Our Group and International businesses continue to be important contributors to our consolidated results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earnings for our remaining operations including run off re-insurance, other operations and Corporate were $1 million for the quarter. Second quarter results for the run off re-insurance segment included the net favorable impact of settlement activity. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now comment briefly on our investment portfolio and results. As we discussed before our investment strategy is to maintain a higher quality, well diversified portfolio. Our investment portfolio performance continues to be very strong competitively. We continue to have no direct exposure to sub-prime loans and no material direct exposure to residential mortgages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our current commercial mortgage portfolio results are strong, reflecting our consistent disciplined approach to underwriting. All of our loans in this portfolio are fully performing and said differently, none of our loans is currently 30 days delinquent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Future realized capital gains and losses cannot be reasonably estimated. Based on the current strength of our portfolio and our consistent record of investment management discipline we currently do not expect our net capital gain or loss results to be material to full year 2008 net income for the enterprise or have any material impact on our outlook for our full year subsidiary dividends. Overall we continue to be pleased with our investment management results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now comment briefly on our capital outlook. Our parent company Capital Position continues to be strong and our subsidiaries remain well capitalized. We ended second quarter 2008 with cash in short term investments at the parent of approximately $100 million. During second quarter we resumed our share repurchase program and repurchased approximately 6.7 million shares or $264 million through July 31<sup>st</sup>, including $44 million in the month on July.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Through the balance of the year we expect subsidiary dividends to be approximately $200 to $250 million. As a result our full year estimate for subsidiary dividends is now $500 to $550 million; the upper end of this range is modestly higher than our previous estimate. At this point, excluding any additional M&amp;A activity or any additional share repurchase we expect other sources and uses of parent company cash in the balance of the year and net to approximately zero.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the balance of the year we expect to continue to increase our parent company cash balance at a modest pace, with the expectation that we would be at our long term target of $250 million by the end of 2009. Our capital management priorities remain consistent with our prior communications. We intend to continue effectively deploying capital for the benefit of our shareholders. In summary, we continue to have a strong capital position and good financial flexibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll review the earnings outlook for full year 2008. For full year 2008 we currently expect consolidated adjusted income from operations of $1.135 to $1.185 billion. While we continue to expect earnings improvement in the second half of the year this updated full year range is lower than the estimates we provided in May. I\u2019ll discuss the components starting with Health Care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We currently expect our medical membership excluding Great-West to end the year approximately 1% higher than year end 2007. This outlook is lower than our previous estimate and takes into account our current assessment of the weaker economic outlook and of the competitive pricing environment. In addition, we currently expect Great-West membership to decrease by approximately 100,000 over the balance of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We continue to expect medical cost trend for our total book of business to be in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year. We expect guaranteed cost pricing yields to exceed trend in the balance of the year. We estimate the full year guaranteed cost MLR excluding the voluntary business will be approximately 83% to 83.5%. For the full year we expect guaranteed cost pricing yields to be in the range of 8% to 8.5% and we expect medical trend for this book to be approximately 7% to 7.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our estimate for full year 2008 Health Care earnings is a range of $700 to $730 million. This range includes approximately $50 million of earnings contribution from the Great-West book. Our updated range is approximately $40 million lower than the full year range we had communicated in May, mainly reflecting lower expectations to our guaranteed cost and experience rated businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our guaranteed cost outlook reflects a modestly higher estimated MLR and lower membership expectations. The updated outlook for experience rated earnings reflects lower full year margin expectations as a result of the lower than expected second quarter results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect Health Care earnings to increase in the second half of the year relative to the first half as we execute additional pricing and on driving actions. We also expect to generate increased earnings from the Great-West book. Our updated outlook reflects approximately a $60 to $90 million after tax earnings increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now discuss the key drivers of that increase. We expect Great-West to contribute approximately $50 million of earnings for the full year. This implies second half earnings of approximately $38 million compared to $12 million in the first half. These amounts exclude financing costs of approximately $5 million per quarter which are included in the corporate segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We estimate that guaranteed cost earnings will be approximately $30 million higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half. This increase is due to an improvement in the MLR as a result of strong renewal pricing and underwriting actions partly offset by lower membership. Specifically we expect the guaranteed cost MLR to be approximately 82% for the second half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We estimate that ASO earnings will essentially be flat in the second half of the year as increased specialty earnings are approximately offset by higher operating expenses. We expect experienced rated earnings to be $5 to $10 million higher in the second half of the year excluding the first quarter charge of $7 million after tax related to the non-medical account. This implies a very modest deterioration relative to second quarter actual results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We expect Medicare Part D to move from a break even position for six months to positive earnings of $10 million for the full year. With respect to operating expenses we expect to increase our investments in information technology capabilities in the second half of the year. Our investments will be focused on capabilities which we believe will be key to winning in the market over the next several years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also expect increased investments in the second half of the year to support our segment expansions particularly the individual and small group segments. At the same time we intend to identify additional expense reductions in other areas which we expect to benefit our second half results and have a larger favorable impact on 2009. All in, our current estimate is that operating expenses will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first. In total we estimate that Health Care earnings will improve in the second half of the year yielding full year earnings at a range of $700 to $730 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019ll discuss the balance of our segments. We expect our remaining operations to contribute approximately $435 to $455 million of earnings for the full year. We expect our group disability and life and International businesses to continue to grow revenue while maintaining strong margins. Specifically, we expect mid-single digit earnings growth in Group and double digit earnings growth in International for the full year 2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Earnings for the balance of our operations which include run-off businesses and the parent are expected to be lower in the second half of the year than in the first, mainly reflecting higher debt financing costs and the impact of lower cash balances on parent company investment income. In addition, we do not expect year to date favorable settlement activity and re-insurance to repeat in the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to our consolidated outlook, as is customary our estimates for earnings and EPS assume no additional share repurchase. On this basis we estimate that our full year 2008 consolidated adjusted income from operations will be in a range of $1.135 to $1.185 billion and that EPS will be in a range of $4.05 to $4.25 a share. Our estimated range of EPS is equal to our previous range. This reflects the benefit of stock repurchase completed to date which we expect to offset lower Health Care earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking ahead to 2009 we expect to achieve attractive earnings growth despite pressure on several fronts. We expect that the economy will remain weak and that the pricing environment will continue to be very competitive. We also anticipate upward pressure on operating expenses as we continue to invest more in enhancing our information technology capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the other hand, there are a number of positive factors. First we currently expect Great-West 2009 earnings to be in a range of $150 to $175 million after tax excluding financing costs. This would represent meaningful earnings growth relative to the expect $50 million contribution in 2008. This updated range for 2009 is lower than our May estimates primarily reflecting higher IT related integration expenses and greater uncertainty around market pricing conditions we had previously forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We also expect to improve experience related margins in 2009 as we continue to execute stronger pricing and underwriting actions. In addition, we expect the operating expense reduction opportunities that we identify in the balance of this year to have a greater impact in 2009. We expect to continue growing earnings in our Group Disability and Life and International businesses. All in we currently expect to achieve attractive earnings growth in 2009. Consistent with past practices we expect to provide specific guidance about our 2009 outlook on next quarters call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To recap our consolidated second quarter 2008 earnings improve relative to first quarter reflecting increased Health Care earnings and continued strong results in Group Disability and Life and International. We expect to further increase earnings in the balance of the year and we expect full year EPS assuming no further repurchase to be in a range of $4.05 to $4.25 a share. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to David.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today I\u2019m going to share some additional perspective on second quarter Health Care results, the outlook including key actions for the balance of 2008 and some thoughts on our Group and International businesses. Let\u2019s get started with Health Care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Ed mentioned the economy continues to have an impact on our customers. We were seeing some significant marketplace challenges that are having an impact on all businesses and in all industries. Our Health service focus drives improved health which drives improved productivity and ultimately cost savings from both employers and the individuals we serve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In this environment our business remains strong and our strategy positions us to effectively help our customers. In addition, our acquisition of Great-West Health on April 1<sup>st</sup> expands our reach geographically in the West and within buyer segments, specifically select employer segments representing employers with less than 250 employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today I\u2019m going to share with you first, some thoughts on our 2008 membership outlook and medical cost trends. Second, additional insights on our second quarter 2008 results including actions we\u2019re taking to further expand profitability. Third, an update on integration on Great-West Health Care and finally, an update on our strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a membership perspective a total medical membership a the end of June is 12.1 million members including the addition of approximately 1.8 million Great-West Health Care members on April 1<sup>st</sup>. We are working to stabilize the Great-West client base in 2009 for improved total medical costs position, access to barter specialty programs and our focus on health improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our total medical membership has grown 1% excluding Great-West since the end of 2007, with higher membership in our service products, partially offset by lower membership and guaranteed cost products. As Mike discussed decline in guaranteed cost membership was higher than expected reflecting our pricing discipline in a very competitive environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Additionally, we have seen higher dis-enrollment as employer workforces decline. We expect our membership at the end of the year to be approximately 1% higher than at the end of last year. From a medical cost perspective we continue to expect trend to be in the 6.5% to 7.5% range for 2008 consistent with our previous estimates. This is primarily achieved from effective execution by our contracting team along with strong execution from our medical management and health efficacy programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to earnings, as Mike discussed our second quarter earning improved from first quarter 2008 as a result of increased contributions from lower operating expenses, our specialty businesses and earnings from the Great-West acquisition. Looking forward, our earning projection for the full year is now $700 to $730 million. We expect to achieve meaningful improvement in our second half earnings from four key actions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, Great-West earning will contribute higher earnings in the second half of the year. Our focus on preserving and growing the existing membership driving total medical cost improvement and integrating the operations will also provide a strong catalyst for 2009 earnings growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, we expect the guaranteed costs earnings to increase in the second half of 2008 reflecting the impact of strong pricing execution and underwriting actions. We expect additional margin expansion in the second half of 2008 from renewal pricing yields that are approximately 200 to 250 basis points higher than our medical cost trend. We\u2019re seeing these pricing results in the July 1<sup>st</sup> renewals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Third, our experience rated earnings are expected to stabilize in the second half of 2008, as a result of aggregate rate actions being greater than expected medical cost trends which will enhance margins on our second half business. Additionally, we\u2019ll seek to expand margins with our January 2009 renewals as we balance membership growth objectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fourth, regarding expenses we will create additional operating efficiencies and organization to partially offset the increased expenses from two areas. Our expansion in the individual and small group segments and from technology investments to support our growth and position us for further expense synergies in 2009 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a final note, as Mike mentioned our Medicare book of business will have higher earning in the second half of 2008 from the seasonal nature of the Part D product. Looking forward we remain committed to maintaining our pricing and underwriting discipline and improving our medical cost results for a combination of pricing actions and ongoing medical costs management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to acquisition of the Great-West Health Care business we are four months into the integration and are making good progress with minimal disruption. We remain focused on preserving and ultimately growing the existing Great-West Health Care book of business. On integrating provider networks and clinical programs as well as key aspects of the infrastructure and as we\u2019ve noted in the past we expect to attain and build on the strength of the Great-West organization. To that end we are pleased that we have been able to retain almost all of the Great-West employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn to my final Health Care topic, our health service strategy. More and more employers are interested in our focus on the individual because at the end of the day that\u2019s where you can make the real difference. As a health service company we\u2019ll focus on being the best at listening to, understanding and helping individuals improve their health and providing the best customer service experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This approach is relevant for all individuals keeping the healthy, healthy, reducing the risk levels for the healthy at risk, ensuring the most affective course of treatment for those with chronic conditions and addressing the needs of those with acute medical conditions. As we look forward, we recognize the system needs further simplification. To that end last week we announced our integrated personal health team. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This team combines behavioral health care, lifestyle management programs, case management, disease management, health care change and employee assistance programs with a single point of contact for the individual customer. One call, one phone number gets our customer to a personal health advocate who will be their guide to whatever type of help is needed. It could be nutrition advice, help to manage stress, resources to cope with all aspects of a major illness or just answer a question about a claim. The goal is to personalize and simplify the experience for our customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We recognize it is important for these programs to be built on a strong foundation and a track record of service and clinical program delivery. From a service standpoint we\u2019re ranked as the number one national health plan in customer satisfaction and all our call centers have been certified again this year by JD Power Associates. From a clinical standpoint we\u2019ve also been recognized again as having the best clinical quality outcomes as measured through NCQA and HEDIS again this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In June we launched a new corporate branding customer advertising campaign. We\u2019re sending a different message of what we think a health service company is and needs to be. It starts with recognizing the issues that everyone faces. We\u2019ll do everything in our power to simplify and improve for our customers benefit. Our objective to be clear is to make your path to health and well being as easy as possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now I\u2019d like to shift gears and spend a few minutes on our Group insurance and International businesses. Both businesses will deliver top line and bottom line growth again in 2008. Each business has a strong leadership team and benefits from a good competitive position whether that\u2019s in disability, life and accident or expatriate benefits in individual health and life products for individuals and global employers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our Group business we delivered best in class results with our disability claim management model. We help people return to work sooner than the competition. Like our Health Care business our Group business is steeped in clinical excellence. One of the differentiators for us is our ability to integrate our programs. People with our disability and health plan have lower rates of disability and return to work more quickly. That\u2019s real value for the individual customer and for the employer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Results from our International business remain competitively strong with robust growth in targeted markets around the world. Most notably in the individual direct marketed health, life and accident insurance businesses in Asia and in the international expatriate benefit business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today many corporations are employer customers are seeing significant growth outside the United States. The idea of multi-national borderless solutions is increasing. Employers and individuals are looking for solutions that offer access to quality providers, affordable care and have dimensions of portability. At CIGNA we\u2019re well positioned to integrate our services and leverage the depth of understanding and experience we have in these global markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll end my formal remarks with a reiteration that we\u2019re taking appropriate actions to further improve profitability of our Health Care book of business. First, we will effectively integrate the Great-West business and realize the added earnings power it brings to CIGNA. Second, we will expand our operating margins of our Health Care book of business for a combination of pricing and underwriting actions on our guaranteed cost and experience rated book. Effective total medical cost management and ongoing improvements operating effectiveness and efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Third, we will ensure effective client and individual service delivery from our existing programs while we innovate our health service offerings for 2009 and beyond. We are committed to further improving our results in 2008 and ensuring we are well positioned as we look toward 2009. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Ed for his closing remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Ed Hanway</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Before we take your questions I want to underscore several points. It is our diverse mix of businesses that has enabled us to profitably grow earnings for our ongoing businesses in 2008. We are committed to improving our Health Care results over the balance of 2008 by maintaining a strong focus on pricing and underwriting discipline and continued effective medical cost management, particularly with regard to our guaranteed cost and experience rated businesses as David has noted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the second half of 2008 we will continue to make investments in targeted market expansions for our Health Care business. We believe this will lead to good growth opportunities in the long term. Regarding our 2008 outlook, I remain confident that we can achieve our full year earnings per share range of $4.05 to $4.25 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Looking to 2009 it is important to note that CIGNA has very good prospects to grow earnings in our ongoing businesses. We expect to leverage the Great-West acquisition and the strong competitive position we have built in the Health Care marketplace to produce significant earnings growth for Health Care in 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, our value proposition in both our Group Disability and Life and International operations will enable us to continue to profitably grow these businesses in 2009 while maintaining their competitively superior margins. Our ability to grow earnings in each of our ongoing businesses coupled with continued effective capital management will enable us to deliver significant EPS growth in 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In closing, I believe that CIGNA has strong market position in each of our ongoing businesses and that we will leverage these positions to continue to create value for the benefit of our customers and our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we\u2019d be glad to take your questions.</p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m trying to understand with your renewal rate increases does that reflect the rate increases were adequate to some degree coming into this year and into the second quarter? If that\u2019s the case just help us understand has it been trend higher than expected or to what extent has it been a dynamic of the pricing pressure in the market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding the guaranteed cost book I would not characterize our renewal rate increase thus far in 2008 as inadequate. In fact, to put some numbers around it our pricing yields on a year to date basis for 2008 in the guaranteed cost book are 7.4% that compares to medical cost trend for the guaranteed cost book in the first half of the year of 7.1%. Admittedly we didn\u2019t expand margins as much as we had targeted mainly reflecting the higher level of catastrophes in terms of claims as well as the higher medical costs from the flu.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The main point here is that we\u2019ll get additional leverage in the second half of the year through even stronger pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019re actually expecting, as I said in my prepared remarks, full year pricing yields to be 8% to 8.5% which includes pricing increases net pricing yields for the second half of 9% to 10% which is obviously higher than first half and even higher than medical costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as inadequate rate increases but I would characterize it as we expect better pricing and underwriting actions in the second half of the year which will improve the MLR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I realize you guys gave full medical enrollment guidance but can you just drill down to what you expect from the guaranteed cost business in terms of enrollment in light of those rate increases that you\u2019re putting through?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re down 11% on a year to date basis and we now expect full year membership to be down approximately 15% as compared to we were approximately at minus 10% at first quarter, an additional five points of membership loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What are you guys seeing in terms of the stop loss pricing? One of your competitors talked to a pricing cycle in that segment coming from of the non-managed care re-insurance companies. How do you think that may impact your ability to do some of the re-pricing that you\u2019re looking to do on the Great-West business?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our stop loss results continue to be very strong. Our loss ratios have been stable over the last 18 months and actually significantly improved from the \u201905, \u201906 timeframe. In terms of competitive pricing conditions I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s a very competitive market. There are certainly a number of specialty players, people that we think of as the second tier in the industry working hard to compete on the basis of price to maintain their membership. It is a competitive market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to the Great-West earnings expansion the vast bulk of the earnings expansion in Great-West actually stems from delivering lower medical costs for this book as opposed to trying to somehow price higher than the medical cost trend, it\u2019s more lowering the medical costs to take advantage of our more favorable total medical cost position and what Great-West has had historically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to the CIGNA team as Mike said we\u2019ve had a very good track record there we have a dedicated business unit and it\u2019s been a well run book of business for our shop loss for some time. The specific piece of Great-West I\u2019ll ask you to think about is in the select segment, for employers 250 and below it\u2019s not like our go to market strategy now is offering it as stop loss is optional. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is an integrated sale so you\u2019re not coming up against the same specialty carve out vendors and as Mike said, we\u2019re increasing value by adding the additional medical costs on improvement and specialty solutions. We still feel very good about that strategy in market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Joshua Raskin - Lehman Brothers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joshua Raskin - Lehman Brothers</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A couple questions on Great-West. First, membership I think you reported 1.76 million and you were suggesting 1.4 million last quarter. I assume there\u2019s classification issues there just curious what that was. Also the medical payables up $50 million I\u2019m curious how much of that was Great-West. Are there any planed systems conversions for some of the Great-West systems?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the Great-West membership you\u2019re exactly right there are some classification issues in terms of what we count as members versus what Great-West has historically counted as members. Based on our membership definition which has been consistent for several years now we are including a number of PPA members that are either in PPAs at Great-West, now CIGNA obviously owns as well as PPA members that are accessing that medical network.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Based on that definition we were able to count roughly 250,000 or so members that are in those arrangements that\u2019s why we\u2019re reporting 1.76 million members.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the payables, at June 30, Great-West reserves on a net basis were $67 million of the overall balance of $827 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joshua Raskin - Lehman Brothers</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Systems conversions anything planned for Great-West?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you might recall when we talked about the Great-West acquisition we suggested that one of the real attractive parts for us was to secure their infrastructure and build on that. The way I\u2019d ask you to think about the systems conversions for the market facing systems and tools, claim payment and market support those systems for the select segment and the core Great-West members will stay in place. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great-West was in the process and will continue that process of enhancing those systems and moving to an upgraded platform from a market standpoint. We will build on those systems and will note convert that business in mass to CIGNA systems. Behind the scenes as you might expect there\u2019s some infrastructural support for data centers, etc. which we had planned for but the most important message is the service proposition to the individual member, the employer, and the physicians will stay off their very strong systems today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Joshua Raskin - Lehman Brothers</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Are you expecting more attrition in \u201909 on the Great-West book as well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this point we\u2019ve not communicated specific membership projections for 2009. I think it\u2019s fair to say that imbedded in our current earnings range for 2009 is some additional downward pressure on membership but we do expect by year end 2009 to be able to stabilize that book particularly given the access to the improved medical cost position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First I wanted to think about medical costs could you size for us the impact of the higher level of catastrophic claims you saw in the quarter and also the negative development that was rolling through from 1Q. Maybe a little color commentary on the catastrophic claims, Coventry at least have spoken to higher acuity levels that they\u2019re seeing and I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re seeing as it relates to that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of quantifying this for the first six months of the year we saw catastrophic claims including catastrophic claims related to what we believe is the flu in first quarter of approximately 50 basis points. Most of that is centered in first quarter and you\u2019re right in terms of your assertion the first quarter did emerge worse than we had expected that\u2019s picked up in the second quarter reported results. It would be 50 basis points all together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of specifics underneath that we did see an increase in the acuity of claims and just overall higher inpatient costs. Interestingly that has been centered in the guaranteed cost book, we did not see a material change in either the ASO or the experience rated book in the first half of the year as it relates to catastrophic claims. Therefore we do not believe this is a widespread phenomenon, our guaranteed cost experience tends to be concentrated in some under 50 accounts as well as a couple of selected geographies. I would not characterize it as an overall issue here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The final point I would make is that remember the medical cost trend for guaranteed costs for the first six months of the year has been 7.1% versus the comparable period in 2007. For full year what\u2019s modeled is medical cost trend for the full year guaranteed cost book of 7% to 7.5%. We\u2019re not talking about an overall seat change in terms of trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There\u2019s not a theory that this something to do with coding creep or something like that, it\u2019s more about a relatively small book of business and some bad luck?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I believe that to be the case. Particularly given that we did not see a comparable acceleration in trend or a comparable acceleration in cat claims suffer ASO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remember the guaranteed cost is 8% or 9% of our total membership. We tend to get a little more volatility there. No, we would not say that there\u2019s a broad, we don\u2019t see any of it until the broad sweeping different movement in your terminology code creep or up-coding or chance in profile that way. There\u2019s always a bit of movement plus or minus but nothing unique.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A few points on Great-West I want to make sure I understand the $150 to $170 million for \u201909 your guiding to compares to the $170 to $180 from last quarter is that the correct comparison?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the transaction costs that your bearing in \u201908 I think your guidance was $45 to $50 million before I want to see if that\u2019s still the same? How much was born in the 2Q because I think the assumption was that the vast majority of that would be born in the 2Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s correct. The update, we refer to it internally as integration expense. They tend to be integration and transition costs because they\u2019re incremental expenses that we don\u2019t think will be part of our expense base for the long term. Our current estimate for that for 2008 is $50 million after tax. At the upper end of the previous range the main delta there is higher IT costs it\u2019s the phenomenon David was referencing earlier. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve got a little higher data center migration costs including higher labor costs. We\u2019re also likely to incur some upgraded software costs not to do with the major change in customer facing systems or anything but behind the scenes costs. That\u2019s the reason we\u2019re now at the upper end of that range for 2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">How much was born in 2Q?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The rest was born in 2Q that we had anticipated it was just a shade more than a third of that $50 million. We do expect third quarter to be modestly higher and then fourth quarter to be modestly lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To bridge Mike\u2019s comment to 2009 as well, the somewhat higher transitional costs are on technology in \u201908 we expect also to see some higher transitional costs in technology in 2009 and that\u2019s one of the primary items that affects the earnings range that you reference before and our focus here is to ensure that we\u2019re doing everything that\u2019s prudent to make sure we have no disruption or minimal disruption as possible for the benefit of the customers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Knock on wood thus far there\u2019s been minimum disruption and we\u2019re really fixated on that to make sure the service proposition which as been strong from Great-West continues to be very strong on all fronts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>John Rex \u2013 JP Morgan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The next two thirds mostly would be born in 3Q of that $50 million is that right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s our current estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My first question if you could touch on the catastrophic claims again, I\u2019m curious why that doesn\u2019t impact your stop loss results, why a higher level of inpatient acute wouldn\u2019t be rubbing up against your stop loss threshold?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall it\u2019s really the same point that we talked about earlier. We don\u2019t see it as a widespread phenomenon in terms of increased acuity in terms of inpatient claims. We did see it specifically in the guaranteed cost block which again is a relatively small part of our overall membership block. It was concentrated in a couple of specific geographies, concentrated in the under 50 group business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s a combination of volatility we\u2019re also anti-selection particularly with the under 50 book. We don\u2019t see any evidence that it has spread at this point to the more stable ASO in experience books at this point. We would have seen that as higher stop loss claims on both ASO and ER if in fact that had spread to those books.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is there any concern on the guaranteed cost book where you\u2019re raising rates ahead of trend that if there is anti-selection those rate actions are only going exacerbate the problem and you\u2019re going to lose more of your good risk?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly in the under 50 book in certain states that require community rates or specific filed rates that don\u2019t vary group to group there is that risk. Remember, the 50 block is a very small proportion even of our overall guarantee cost block. We have less than 100,000 members in that book. We are re-underwriting that book market to market and certainly are cognizant of the point you are making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Two points, one is the risk always exists but you should anticipate that we\u2019re going to pass a blanket rate increase across the book of business as Mike said other than when we\u2019re dealing with the under 50. Secondly, as we look at our July result it would suggest that the loss ratios on the business we\u2019re retaining versus the loss ratios on the business that we are losing are in the direction we expect. The loss ratios are higher on the business we are losing then on the business we are retaining which would suggest we\u2019re retaining the better risks and differentiating our pricing strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Gregory Nersessian - Credit Suisse</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Do I understand that the bulk of the repurchases for this year are complete? Could you run through what your uses and sources of cash in terms of what\u2019s available for repurchase?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We ended second quarter with $100 million of parent company cash. We expect subsidiary dividends in the second half of the year between $200 and $250 million. Remember we also repurchased $44 million in July that you need to take out of the roll forward. What that says if we use the mid-point for example that would say if we did no further repurchase, no M&amp;A over the remainder of the year we would expect to end the year at $280 million of parent company cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our policy is to be non-committal in terms of share repurchase but I think you can conclude from my prepared remarks that we would expect to end the year in terms of parent company cash balance somewhere between the $100 million that we had at June 30, and our long term target which we\u2019d expect to gradually get to at year end 2009 $250 million. That would be a good way to think about the ranging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First question, if you can give us an early read into what you\u2019re expecting for medical costs in 2009. It looks like most of the competitors are expecting some modest upward pressure that they\u2019re planning to price to. It seem it\u2019s sort of 8% might be the composite expectation so far for \u201909 and if you could talk about your view for med costs looking out to \u201909?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It is early, obviously to give definitive guidance in terms of 2009 but what I can tell you is that for cases where we\u2019ve had to do early quotes for insured cases for 2009 we have been assuming roughly 50 basis points of higher medical cost trend in 2009 then what we\u2019ve been seeing here in 2008. That would suggest 7% to 8% in 2009 as opposed to the 6.5% to 7.5% we\u2019re experiencing thus far in 2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would point out on the reported basis Great-West is going to add some noise to the trend numbers we\u2019re still sorting out how they end up reporting medical cost trend. The numbers I just described are on a CIGNA basis \u2018x\u2019 Great-West but at least would be apples to apples with the 6.5% to 7.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On medical costs if you could walk through the components in 2Q and how that might have shifted from 1Q and any early thoughts on how those might move around for \u201909?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Marcia Dall</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Mike mentioned earlier our medical trend is expected to be 6.5% to 7.5% consistent with our prior guidance. When you look at the components they\u2019re essentially consistent with our prior guidance as well, with inpatient and outpatient in the high single digits and professional in the mid single digits. Related to pharmacy we are updating our trend expectations from the high single digits to the mid single digits reflecting improvements in the generic drug utilization and overall lower pharmacy utilization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">To add on in terms of 2009 your question, at this point we have not seen any specific upward pressure on medical costs for \u201909 for any of the categories. As an example, the hospital renewals that we\u2019ve had to date have been in line with our targets which have been in line with our 2008 actuals. We\u2019ll obviously give further specificity by category Marcia will likely do that at the third quarter call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Is it fair to say then that the 50 bp assumed increase that would just be some more cushion around utilization for \u201909?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Essentially that\u2019s right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One last question, I know the focus on improving the medical costs in the stop loss business is a big part of the Cinergy target for Great-West maybe if you can update us on the progress so far around those initiatives and how those are tracking relative to your expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Relative to the medical cost improvement, the nature of the product is such that you have an ASO relationship and stop loss relationship. As we are able to improve the total medical costs the beauty of it is a meaningful amount of that total medical cost accretes to the full year and ultimately to the employer individual relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A portion of that accretes to us through the stop loss relationship etc. The progress we\u2019re seeing thus far is that we\u2019re stepping through 2008 into 2009 as we sit here today we expect to be able to achieve our total medical costs improvement by the end of 2009 and we expect to have a meaningful amount of that total medical costs improvements secured by the first quarter 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Justin Lake \u2013 UBS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One further question on GW you mentioned that you expect to see another 100,000 members attrition for the end of the year. Can you give us an idea of how many members are renewing over that period July 1 through the end of the year, what percentage of the book actually renews?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thirty percent of the book renews the second half of the year and 70% of the book renewed the first half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If I think about 30% should I multiply that number times the 1.7 million that you reported?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s correct.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Out of 500,000 members we\u2019re talking about 100,000 treading? Is that about right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think it\u2019s fair. I would point out though that the mix of business here is particularly important. We actually expect a higher rate of lapse in the membership that is part of these PPA arrangements which tend to be lower margin. At least year to date on an actual basis the persistency on the select segment which is the small group Great-West full service business has actually been higher than the overall average. That\u2019s where the bulk of the earnings power is for 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you\u2019re building your own earnings model for 2009 I wouldn\u2019t try to spread that proportionally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What has been the attrition, if you think about 2008 what\u2019s been the attrition in that select membership?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The overall persistency has been in the mid 80\u2019s for the select segment. In terms of percentages, the overall Great-West book is down 3.5% year to date. The select is a little small decrease than that I just don\u2019t have that number committed to memory but its a couple points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the experience rated book I know you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing higher deficit dollars in total. Can you run us through some of the numbers you did on last quarter as far as the percentage of accounts in deficit and new business versus existing business and what those deficits were? Were they $132 million last quarter, I just doing that from memory?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, good memory. Let me walk through an overview of the numbers and you can tell me if you\u2019d like to go deeper on any of the specifics. I feel compelled to remind you that this is a great product for us, remember this is our highest earning product per member and we believe there\u2019s no real win, win. In second quarter we did see an improvement in the medical loss ratio, it improved sequentially approximately 150 basis points. If you take 150 basis points times the $493 million of medical premiums you conclude that it improved $4 to $5 million after tax.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In fairness, it did not improve as much as we expected it to and that\u2019s the reason for the lower full year outlook for experience rated. In terms of some of the specific numbers that you\u2019re interested in we did in fact experience an increase in deficit recoveries in second quarter versus first. We also saw an increase in the new and existing deficits. The $132 million that you recalled is right in terms of the end of first quarter that increased to $151 million at the end of second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Remember that increase that $19 million was fully charged to earnings and in fact all $151 million has been charged over time fully to earnings. Remember, today\u2019s deficit balances are tomorrow\u2019s opportunity for deficit recovery which is potentially a good thing. It\u2019s fair to say now that for the full year 2008 we do expect additional deficit recoveries in the second half of the year in the pricing and underwriting actions that we\u2019re taking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We now expect deficits in the second half of the year on the first half of the case renewals to increase based on what we saw here in terms of second quarter actual. The net impact, the net, net impact now on second half the year earnings is that we expect second half of the year experience rated earnings to be $5 to $10 million after tax higher than the first half which is therefore modestly lower than the second quarter run rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The real interesting opportunity here of course is the first half of the year 2009 renewals. We have an opportunity for additional deficit recovery even greater than what we had expected before. We expect to be in a position to quantify those expectations at the end of October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">What percentage of the accounts are in deficit and how does that compare to first quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re currently at June 30, at 34% and that compares to 35% at the end of first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s actually improved so the size of the deficit is getting larger?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, modestly. I wouldn\u2019t overreact but it is fair to say. One particular account that actually is a loss in the single digit after tax earnings range that is a 10% of the overall $151 million balance. That\u2019s an account that\u2019s renewing later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One more question of experience rated I know you\u2019ve always said this business runs at a very attractive margin and I realize you don\u2019t want to discuss the specific margin on the call. Can you give us an idea how far away are you right now if you think about your 2008 results include the higher deficit what kind of basis point difference are you from that target margin that you think you should historically run in this business \u2018x\u2019 the recoveries or increased deficit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">A portion of our lower earnings expectation for 2008 roughly a third of it is driven by lower revenue expectations. We now expect membership to be down 2% for the full year for experience rated than what we had versus previous growth that we originally expected in terms of earnings for 2008 we expected growth. We\u2019re now saying down 2% which means revenue we expect to be up 4% to 5% for the full year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of your specific question in terms of margins we expect to end 2008 with margins on this book that ball park are in $30 to $40 million after tax lower than what we historically targeted, $30 to $40 million after tax on approximately $3 billion of overall revenue you could conclude a percentage point or a shade worse than that in terms of after tax margins full year \u201908 versus what we\u2019ve historically run longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously we\u2019ve got some real important decisions to make here in terms of 2009 how much of that do we try to recover and that when we\u2019ll give additional quantification in the third quarter call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The $3 billion number does that include all the ancillary?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s what I was referring to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Justin Lake - UBS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The $30 to $40 million is without the improvement in recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That would include in fact getting the deficits back to our historical target of 30%. It would include some level of recovery back from where we are currently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Douglas Simpson - Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Douglas Simpson - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I was wondering if we could talk about \u201909 in a general sense. I know you don\u2019t want to get too specific in talking about Health Care segment profit if we look at the $715 million the mid-point of the range for this year directionally if we then said Great-West is going to add about $100 million incremental from \u201908 to \u201909 that gets us to an $815 million number that would be about 15% growth year over year. I\u2019m trying to connect the dots. Ed had commented about the opportunity for significant segment profit growth in that area. Is that a reasonable starting point?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The components that you\u2019re talking about are in fact reasonable again just to reiterate we prefer not to give specific numbers at this point. We do expect to give specific numbers on the third quarter call. To flush out your list a bit more the list of plusses and minuses are a little longer than what you described. I think you\u2019re right on Great-West; we\u2019re modeling $100 to $125 million of earnings growth \u201908 to \u201907 for Great-West.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We do expect continued specialty earnings growth to increase ASO earnings just like we\u2019ve seen this year. As I mentioned to Justin\u2019s question we do expect better margins in ER than what we\u2019ve gotten so far this year. I\u2019d rather no try to dimension the number there but we do expect better there. Remember we are going to get the benefit of the transformation amortization rolling off and as we\u2019ve talked about previously that\u2019s approximately $30 million or so after tax.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The final part I would list here is the segment expansions. This year we expect a drain of $15 to $20 million of after tax we\u2019ve invested in individual, small group and seniors. Next year we expect that to be modestly accretive so that would be a positive. Going the other way though I think it\u2019s important to note two things. One would be that we do expect higher IT expenses. Our entire sector is investing in additional technology capabilities to capitalize on this market need for additional consumer engagement, help advocacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">This requires additional technology than what we\u2019ve had or the sector has had historically. In addition, the other wild card is the challenging economy and the competitive pricing environment which will particularly have an impact on guaranteed costs. We\u2019ve got some work to do in terms of the sizing out the various plusses and minuses but that\u2019s at a high level on our plus, minus for Health Care for \u201909.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As Mike said in his prepared remarks if you look at \u201909 we do view the marketplace is going to continue to be challenging both competitively the economy, etc. Having said that we have a wonderful growth catalyst in Great-West with the diversity of the earnings stream beyond that from the Disability and International businesses, we expect to continue to stay strong. I would reiterate Mike\u2019s point that presents the opportunity for us to have attractive earnings growth and invest back in ourselves and technology, further segment expansion and so we\u2019re well positioned for \u201909 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Douglas Simpson - Merrill Lynch</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In the prepared remarks there was a comment that the plusses and minuses was we have the operating expense up tick for the HIT but on the other hand you expect operating expense reductions. Could you help us think out netting the two of those?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At this point I prefer not to be specific there. We\u2019ve got some very important work to do over the next 60 days. I do believe that directionally there is going to be increased pressure for us to spend more on IT. This year we would expect to spend more on the segment expansion. Next year I believe that will turn into accretive earnings. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You\u2019re absolutely right, we do expect that we need to reduce operating expenses further. We know we need to improve our competitive operating expense position in 2009 that\u2019s likely going to require additional reductions here in 2008. I\u2019d rather not try to size that at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your last question comes from Charles Boorady \u2013 Citigroup.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Charles Boorady \u2013 Citigroup</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Great-West can you talk about your network re-contracting progress and what your assumptions are in your \u201909 Great-West guidance that you gave for net loss ratio improvement in the degree to which that come from pricing versus re-contracting the network.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>David Cordani</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll start with the networking contracting and medical cost improvement then I\u2019ll ask Mike to pick up from the MOR and other points. First, as we think about the total medical cost improvement it\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re looking at that as the improvement of the total medical costs. Network optimization, clinical model optimization, provider service model optimization and it\u2019s built on both Great-West and CIGNA having a very good track record of servicing the doctors and hospitals so we\u2019re able to build off that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Second, as we suggested in the past, it\u2019s not going to transpire over night we we\u2019re on a methodical path to see improvement in 2008 and 2009. Our expectations are to see some improvement in 2008 in order magnitude of the total opportunity that we expect we can improve medical costs maybe around 20% of that we\u2019ll incur in 2008. We see line of sight to be able to achieve our total medical cost improvement goals and objectives by the end of 2009. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As we sit here today with the interactions back and forth between the doctors and hospitals we\u2019ll have a meaningful amount of that completed for the first quarter 2009 which is important because then we\u2019re able to see continued improvement in the value delivery back to the Great-West customers both the ASO customers who benefit directly from that as well as some of the stop loss benefits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding the MLR for 2009 to give some additional background we expect that stop loss premiums next year ball park will be approximately $800 million for the full year. What we\u2019re modeling is an improvement in earnings contribution from an improved MLR in the $50 to $65 million after tax range. That\u2019s what\u2019s embedded in the $150 to $175 million projection for \u201909 that I gave in the prepared remarks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are about to embark on literally market to market plans to sort out our product strategy, our pricing strategies here for 2009 so we\u2019ve got some very important decisions to make around the pricing and membership trade off here for \u201909. We believe that the $50 to $65 million is achievable. It would improve the MLR but not to the level actually that we\u2019ve historically run at CIGNA. Therefore, while there\u2019s more work to come and we\u2019ll update this again at third quarter. We do expect this to be achievable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Charles Boorady \u2013 Citigroup</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On experience rated you made some commentary on the second half versus first half is the fourth quarter still when we should expect the most noise in the ER results?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Mike Bell</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t expect that there\u2019d be a tremendous amount of noise in the fourth quarter results. I do think that we\u2019ll see additional improvement in the third quarter from the pricing and underwriting actions that we\u2019ve targeted. We do expect net yields for the second half of the year for ER to be in the 8.5% to 9% range compared to the 6% to 7% that we achieved in the first half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The only thing I can think of off the top of my head that would specifically impact fourth quarter would be that given the increase in the percentage of the book that is now in high deductible plans. I could conceive of an up tick in medical costs sequentially third to fourth but we have modeled that in terms of the full year. We expect the full year medical costs for just he ER book to be approximately 8% and that is picked up the phenomenon I just described is included at a higher level in the fourth quarter estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ladies and gentlemen this concludes CIGNA\u2019s second quarter 2008 results review. CIGNA Investor Relations will be available to respond to additional questions shortly.</p>", "twitContent": "$CI - CIGNA Corporation Q2 2008 Earnings Call Transcript. https://seekingalpha.com/article/88630-cigna-corporation-q2-2008-earnings-call-transcript?source=tweet ", "innerMarketing": null, "marketingBullet": "", "isReit": false, "videoData": null, "marketingBulletVariant": null, "marketingBio": null}, "relationships": {"author": {"data": {"id": "44211", "type": "author"}}, "sentiments": {"data": []}, "primaryTickers": {"data": [{"id": "2109", "type": "tag"}]}, "secondaryTickers": {"data": []}, "otherTags": {"data": [{"id": "96991", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17896", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "49", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "326", "type": "tag"}, {"id": "17904", "type": "tag"}]}, "coAuthors": {"data": []}, "presentations": {"data": []}, "updates": {"data": []}, "corrections": {"data": []}}, "links": {"self": "/article/88630-cigna-corporation-q2-2008-earnings-call-transcript", "canonical": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/88630-cigna-corporation-q2-2008-earnings-call-transcript", "uriImage": "https://static.seekingalpha.com/assets/og_image_1200-29b2bfe1a595477db6826bd2126c63ac2091efb7ec76347a8e7f81ba17e3de6c.png", "schemaImage": null}}, "included": [{"id": "44211", "type": "author", "attributes": {"company": null, "slug": "sa-transcripts", "userId": 101639, "tagId": 96991, "image": {"small": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/small_pic.png", "medium": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/medium_pic.png", "big": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/big_pic.png", "extra_large": "https://static3.seekingalpha.com/images/users_profile/000/101/639/extra_large_pic.png"}, "nick": "SA Transcripts", "bio": "Seeking Alpha's transcripts team is responsible for the development of all of our transcript-related projects.
