Our fourth quarter results round out a tremendous 2018 for Danaher. During the year, strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion delivered double-digit adjusted EPS and mid-teens free cash flow growth. We delivered 6% core revenue growth for the full year, which was a meaningful step up versus prior years, led primarily by the impact of new product innovation and commercial initiatives. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The Danaher business system continued to serve as the driving force behind our execution and our ability to take share in many of our businesses. We generated $3.4 billion of free cash flow in 2018, resulting in 16.5% growth year-on-year that helps position us for significant capital deployment going forward. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was a 127%, representing the 27 consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded net income. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We deployed over $2 billion of capital during the year, including the acquisitions of IDT and Blue Software. IDT joined our life science platform adding best in class genomics consumables capabilities, and Blue Software now part of Esko enhances our offering across our packaging development and production work flow. We are excited to have both these businesses as part of Danaher. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to the fourth quarter, sales grew 5.5% to $5.4 billion, as the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenue by 2%, while acquisitions increased revenues by 2%. Core revenue increased 5.5% with all five platforms delivering better than expected results. Geographically, high growth markets grew high single digits, led by double digit growth in both China and India. Across the developed markets, we saw high single digit growth in the US, while Western Europe was up low single digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Gross margins for the fourth quarter; gross margin was 55.1%, and operating profit margin was 17.9%. Core operating margin declined 15 basis points, driven primarily by accelerated investment spend, foreign currency impact from a stronger US dollar, and tariff related costs. Full year gross margin was a record high 55.8%, and we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points. This marks the fourth quarter consecutive year that we increased our core operating margin by 70 basis points or more. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted net EPS was $1.28, bringing full year adjusted diluted net EPS to $4.52, our fifth straight year of double digit growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s take a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results across the portfolio. In life sciences, reported revenue increased 10.5% and core revenue was up 7.5%. Operating profit margin declined 30 basis points to 19.7%, as a result of foreign currency impact and accelerated growth investments. For the full year, life sciences delivered an outstanding 180 basis points of core operating margin expansion, a testament to the teams\u2019 strong DBS execution. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the individual operating companies; Beckman Life Sciences achieved high single digit core revenue growth for the quarter. More than 20% growth in automation was driven by demand for new products like the Biomek i Series, Beckman sample preparation platform launched last year. We further enhanced our automation capabilities with our recent bolt-on acquisition of Labcyte Corporation. Labcyte brings complementary technology to the core Beckman offering, with an acoustic dispensing method that is used for liquid handling in life science applications. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The non-contact low-volume dispensing technique eliminates cross contamination risks and greatly reduces fluid loss, helping scientists around the world to achieve better results. These organic and inorganic growth investments are helping us provide best-in-class solutions for our customers and contributing to Beckman Life Sciences above market growth rate. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Leica Microsystems\u2019 core revenue was up mid-single digits with positive performance across most major end markets and regions, led by life science research in North America. Over the last few years, the Leica team has significantly improved their cadence of innovation through the use of DBS tools. Leica introduced three times the number of new products and technologies in 2018 versus the prior year, while improving their project on time delivery by more than 2000 basis points. The combination of better R&amp;D processes along with enhanced commercial execution have contributed to a meaningful step up in Leica\u2019s core revenue growth over the past few years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Core revenue at SCIEX was up high single digits. Strong results in North America and China were broad based driven by demand across the clinical, food testing and forensic end markets. Phenomenex, our separations consumables business achieved high single digit core revenue growth. It\u2019s been two years since we acquired Phenomenex and the team has made tremendous progress with a number of DBS commercial initiatives including funnel management and transformative marketing. Through these and other DBS driven growth initiatives Phenomenex has increased the size of their addressable market by 30%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Pall, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by similar results across both our life sciences and industrial businesses. Biotech was up double-digits, led by strong performance in single use technologies where demand for new products like the iCELLis bioreactor system continues to help drive share gains. IDT delivered mid-teens revenue growth with positive performance across all major regions and product lines. The team continued to build upon early progress with DBS and the business has consistently exceeded our initial performance expectations. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to diagnostics, reported revenue increased 3.5% and core revenue was up 6%. For the full year, diagnostics delivered 6.5% core revenue growth, meaningful step up versus prior years driven by both organic growth investment and the continued evolution of our diagnostics portfolio. Reported operating margin declined by 70 basis points to 18.8% in the fourth quarter, however core operating margin expanded by 20 basis points. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Beckman Diagnostics, core revenue increased at a mid-single digit rate, led by China and improved results in North America. By product line, immunoassay led the way and we saw good growth in automation as well, driven by early success in Europe with our recently launched DxA 5000 automation system. In hematology, we are encouraged by early customer feedback on our new DxH 900 high volume analyzer and the DxH 520 for low to mid volume setting. These are two of the many new products that Beckman introduced this year that expanded our offering and improved our competitive position in the core lab. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Radiometer, high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strong quarter in North America, Western Europe and China. Our blood gas and AQT product lines delivered outstanding results, and we believe Radiometer continued to take share in the acute care market. Leica Biosystems, core revenue was up mid-single digits, with broad based strength across most major regions and product lines, led by double digit growth in Advanced Staining. And at Cepheid, double digit core revenue growth was driven by North America and Western Europe. The business achieved a significant milestone in the fourth quarter, placing its 20,000 instrument globally further expanding Cepheid\u2019s market leading installed base. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Continued innovation around our test menu has also been a meaningful contributor to Cepheid\u2019s outstanding results. The team maintained their cadence of innovation with the recent CE-IVD marking of the Xpert HBV Viral Load test, a new rapid test for the quantitation of the Hepatitis B Virus that delivers results in less than an hour. With the addition of this test, Cepheid now offers a complete virology test menu suitable for any laboratory setting, making high quality testing and disease monitoring accessible to even more clinicians and patients. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning now to our dental segment, reported revenue was flat and operating profit margin increased by 70 basis points to 13.8%. Core operating margins declined by 185 basis points, primarily as a result of ongoing investment spend focused on new product development. Dental core revenue was up 2.5%, one of our better quarters in some time. We remain encouraged by science of end market stabilization, particularly in our North American traditional consumables and equipment business where we saw another quarter of positive sell-out data. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our dental business in China, now over 200 million in annual revenue saw a double digit growth again this quarter. Our approach as a more localized player offering a comprehensive product suite positions us well for continued growth in the region. Our specialty consumables business was up low single digits versus a tough prior year comparison with solid performance across orthodontics and implants. Growth was led by performance in high growth markets with particular strength in China and Eastern Europe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At the Greater New York Dental Show in November, we featured a number of new technologies from across the dental platform. These included the DEXIS titanium inter-oral sensor and Nobel\u2019s X-Guide for computer guided dental implant surgery. Both important products that support the team\u2019s focus on providing customers with the best-in-class, fully integrated digital workflow. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, Ormco\u2019s full-scale Clear aligner system, Spark continues to be very well received in Australia and as a reminder the team obtained FDA 510-k clearance for Spark earlier in the fourth quarter. This is obviously an important step as we continue our expansion of our Clear aligner offering. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to our environmental and applied solutions segment; reported revenue was up 4.5% and core revenue increased 5%. Reported operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 22.7% with modest core margin expansion. In product identification, core revenue increased by mid-single digit rate led by demand for marketing coding equipment and related consumables. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Videojet core revenue was up high single digits, with positive performance across all major regions, end markets and product lines. The team continued to expand Videojet\u2019s powerful installed base, which now includes more than 10,000 remotely connected printers. Using data analytics, we\u2019re able to help customers run their packaging product season plants more efficiently and with fewer instances of disruptive down time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Videojet\u2019s industry leading connectivity provides unique insights to help us serve customers more effectively and this differentiated offering is a key contributor to Videojet\u2019s above-market growth rate. 2018 marked Videojet\u2019s 9<sup>th</sup> consecutive year of mid-single digit or better core growth. Our packaging business which included Esko and X-Rite was down low-single digits, but we\u2019re encouraged by recent order trends and feel well positioned by our improved performance in 2019. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, turning to water quality, core revenue growth to the platform was up mid-single digits. Core revenue increased at Hach at a high single-digit rate of momentum in both municipal and industrial end markets. Geographically, the developed markets in China led the way. For the full year 2018, Hach achieved 10% core revenue growth. The Hach team has consistently combined our expanding commercial execution with innovative new products to deliver this market-leading growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hach\u2019s developed our best-in-class digital marketing platform that we\u2019ve now rolled out across our other Water Quality businesses, and the team has meaningfully expanded Hach\u2019s addressable market with new products like the CM130 chlorine analyzer for dialysis applications and the Claros Water Intelligent Software system. The team\u2019s commitment to continue its improvement has helped Hach differentiate its customer value proposition and further strengthen its competitive advantage. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">At Trojan, core revenue declined due to a tough prior comp comparison, but we saw healthy levels of project bidding activity during the quarter and we\u2019re encouraged by the underlying momentum in the market. Lastly, ChemTreat\u2019s high single digit core revenue growth was driven by strength across North America and Latin America primarily in the food, chemical and oil and gas end markets. The team\u2019s commitment to commercial excellence has helped ChemTreat sustain a remarkable track record with 2018 marking their 51<sup>st</sup> consecutive year of core revenue growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So to wrap up, 2018 was a tremendous year for Danaher and we\u2019re well positioned as we begin 2019. Over the past several years through a combination of organic and inorganic growth initiatives, we\u2019ve transformed Danaher in to a higher growth, higher margin and higher recurring revenue company, with strong footholds in attractive, fast growing end markets. Our portfolio today combined with the power of the Danaher business system positions us well as we focus on delivering long term shareholder value in 2019 and beyond. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We are initiating first quarter adjusted diluted net EPS guidance between $1 and $1.03 which assumed core growth of approximately 4%. We continue to expect full year 2019 core revenue growth of approximately 4% and adjusted diluted net EPS to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.85. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Gugino</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Tom. That concludes our formal comments. Christy, we\u2019re now ready for questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Maybe want to start on margins, obviously a lot of moving pieces here between FX, tariffs, M&amp;A and then some of the dental investments. I know it\u2019s going to be maybe more of a backend loaded year for margin expansion this year, can you maybe just talk about when some of these acquisitions may turn margin accretive? And then can you also comment on your diagnostic margins, looked like they contracted quite a bit, can you maybe just touch on that as well?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure Tycho. Obviously we did a few things here in the fourth quarter to take advantage of what we saw was a pretty strong quarter evolving particularly in the latter month of December, and so we did accelerate some investment, some spend in a couple of areas that impacted both the cost of good sales line and SG&amp;A. We accelerated some investment in life science in particular and in R&amp;D and sales and marketing and also did a few things accelerating some cost actions in diagnostics and make some investments in new products around dental. So I think a few things that really made some good sense there and to your point clearly FX and tariffs were headwinds in the quarter and made a difference. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think if you put those aside, overall margins would have been up roughly about 50 basis points were it not for the FX and tariff impact. So we do see margins continue to improve during the course of the year. Obviously we\u2019ve got a terrific track record here. In terms of acquisition related impact on the margins, IDT turns core here in April, so we\u2019ll start to see those starts to move through. It will take a little bit of a while here before we see the impact of Labcyte obviously our newer acquisition, but IDT obviously will be a much more material contribution. So we\u2019ll see that starting in April which will be a help. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the DX side, as I mentioned, we did accelerate some cost actions and some investment there. We got a terrific line-up of new products that are coming through and so continuing to invest in our automation product, hematology, some new products that are coming a little bit out in the future around immunoassay and clinical chemistry, I think are certainly also are having an impact there, but we think those investments make tremendous sense. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously we had a bit of a comp there with Cepheid coming off with a fourth quarter in 2017 where Cepheid\u2019s top line was up north of 25% a year ago and was up low double digits in the fourth quarter here. So a little bit less \u2013 a little bit of a tough comp there that had some impact on margin, but again specific to DX just coming back very briefly to FX and tariffs, if you put those aside, DX would have been up about 50 basis points in the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt McGrew</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And Tycho maybe just kind of a more color. If you think about the first half headwind that we\u2019ve got in FX, we\u2019re going to see the margin ramp throughout the year. Q1 we\u2019re going to have, of the 400 million of revenue headwind, 200 is going to be in Q1, that\u2019s probably going to be $0.05 or $0.06 of EPS hit in Q1. So if we wouldn\u2019t have had that in Q1 I think we\u2019ve probably would have seen more like double-digit EPS growth at the high end, and the FX impact here in the first half is going to be greater than it will be in the second half heading into \u201919.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on dental, obviously nice recovery there, how much of this you think is kind of broader end market strength versus some of that Danaher-specific factors like the Nobel China strength, and any thing we should be thinking about in terms of Clear Aligner launch in the US in terms of revenue contribution for this year?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Well clearly we\u2019ve seen some stabilization in the end market as I commented in my remarks. And that really is coming in the form of improved sell-out in North America, and specifically in the areas that were more challenged in the past several months in quarters which was on a traditional equipment and consumable side. So end market stabilization definitely a contributor, but our execution continues to improve as well, and a number of the steps that we\u2019ve taken over the last several quarters and that has continued to enhance the way we\u2019re executing in that market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a Clear Aligner perspective, again things are going extremely well in Australia. But we\u2019re trying to take a very thoughtful approach to the way we expand our geographic footprint, making sure that we are cultivating the right customer target as we did in Australia, the digitally savvy end customer dentist and orthodontist, who has historically taken advantage of our insignia product line as an example. And so as we think about geographic expansion, we\u2019ll be thoughtful about where those markets are well set up from our standpoint for commercial execution and obviously we\u2019re in the process of ramping our own capacity and so that will be an impact as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would not expect that we would be talking to material contributions to the dental platform for growth rate this year, but perhaps as we go in to next year we\u2019ll start to be looking at some numbers that are starting to make a difference. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Ross Muken of Evercore. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Muken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So it seems like you had sort of better execution in Beckman this quarter. You know the business has been doing reasonably well relative to your peers. You\u2019re a little underweight in immunoassay. It seems like that had a quite a good quarter. Just give me a little bit of a feel for the execution at Beck and how you feel about sort of that growth step off in to next year, given maybe some of the things you\u2019ve also done in the portfolio there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Ross, the fourth quarter was clearly one of Beckman Diagnostics\u2019 better quarters in some time. And that really comes to or is driven by improved commercial execution in a number of regions and new product innovations starting to drive some impact. And we saw mid-single digit core revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That was really led by immunoassay and automation and those are obviously key drivers here. 2018 is the first time that our immunoassay business has tipped over and become a bit larger than our clinical chemistry business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So you see the impact of our commercial execution there and some of the automation related competitive advantages we have that are driving that immunoassay growth rate, and that growth rate has been very consistent in most cases with our competitive set. And so now we\u2019re mixing upward our core revenue growth by virtue of that performance. North America in particular saw some improvement in growth rates and obviously that\u2019s a key battleground for us, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in our competitive win rates and our customer retention rates. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think a meaningful step up here in to the 3%ish kind of growth rate and what we\u2019re looking for is kind of another 40 to 50 basis points of step up going forward, and I think what we\u2019ve seen historically over the last couple of years is that very thing. Automation is going well as I mentioned in my remarks, hematology, you know that\u2019s been kind of a drag for us. We\u2019re seeing a much more competitive product line because of both the high volume and the low and mid volume offerings now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I think with what\u2019s coming around low and mid volume immunoassay and clinical chemistry as well as some of what we\u2019re doing in terms of menu gaps that we\u2019ll start to see continued or we will see continued performance improvement there. I think one thing to keep in mind is we \u2013 I know we often talk about Beckman its obviously the biggest business in our diagnostic portfolio, but it\u2019s also important to remember the DX platform grew 6.5% in 2018 and so as we do the comparisons appropriately to broad based competitors in the market, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the portfolio is stacking up right now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Ross Muken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful Tom. And may be just \u2013 I feel like you guys have consistently highlighted given where the balance sheet is now and how strong the cash flow is, sort of the M&amp;A fire power opportunity. Obviously though it\u2019s sort of been a choppy or a volatile public equity market which sometimes will make transactions more complicated. But I guess how are you thinking about sort of your ability to execute on something at least more sizeable in the current environment and how are you thinking about valuations as you look at them broadly and whether or not you\u2019ve seen sort of sellers given some of this volatility get a bit more sensible around potential prices?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Well in terms of our ability to execute and we talked about this a fair amount when we were all together in December. We feel terrific about where we are. Some really good acquisitions this year obviously $2 billion or better executed this past year, IDT and Blue and a few other smaller deals are terrific additions to our portfolio. But the balance sheet today it\u2019s in as good a position as almost we have ever been. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">If you think about our leverage ratio today, we\u2019re talking about being about two in terms of net debt-to-EBITDA, that\u2019s the lowest level since pre-Pall and so in terms of our capacity, our ability to execute both from a balance sheet perspective, and of course also from a talent perspective we feel very good about where we are. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the valuation in the market today, we all know that M&amp;A can be episodic, we are nothing if not patient about looking for and cultivating the most strategic and financially attractive deals. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the pipeline is good today, our cultivation levels are as good as ever, you\u2019ve heard us talk about the breadth of that cultivation which is across all the platforms probably with a little bit less emphasis as you might imagine right now in terms of large capital deployment, a little bit less emphasis perhaps on doing that in dental, but certainly the other four platforms are off the front line and with the capacity we have, and the ability to deploy a significant amount of capital this year, we\u2019re hoping that things break our way. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of sensibility of valuations well of course the sellers have always think their valuations are sensible. This volatility helps clearly, I think the shake up in the latter part of last year may have gotten some folks thinking about what they might do, but things have sort of stabilized here. So it\u2019s early, a little tough to tell, but we\u2019re in great shape and are prepared to do things of consequence. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Overall a really strong quarter, I would love to have a little bit color around what you\u2019re seeing out of China, just given the variability of results that we\u2019ve seen across the board from both cyclical and non-cyclical companies have had a range of outcomes that are pretty broad, but what are you guys seeing in China, what are your local guys telling and what kind of confidence do you have in 2019 in the region?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Scott I know there\u2019s a lot of interest in China right now, there\u2019s been a lot written about what appears factually based to be a slow-down in the broad redefined Chinese market. We are not seeing anything specific that we could point to today that is impacting our businesses in China. I think you can start with the fact that we\u2019re really well positioned to cross our core market. Diagnostics, life sciences, water quality, product identification, consumer, packaged goods and of course dental, which as you heard again growing double digits, are great markets to be in. So, I\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s what you\u2019re reading about today which appears to be more of a consumer-driven slow-down in the Chinese market would be as obviously in our businesses. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our business in China was up double-digit in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the 8<sup>th</sup> consecutive quarter or better said the second straight year of double digit growth for us in China. And that was pretty broad based, pretty much across the board; we can\u2019t really point to any particular slow-downs. Over the past three to four years, our China growth has been up high single digits, low single digit. So could we start to see a little bit of an impact there? I think we could. I think these consumer driven impacts can start to move across in to even in the industrial markets psychologies. And while we have a very little industrial exposure left broadly defined at Danaher, whether that\u2019s a Pall Industrial or Hach Industrial or PID Industrial, probably less than 10% of Danaher today and therefore at even a smaller portion of our China business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Those are the things we\u2019ll watch carefully as indicators as to whether or not we\u2019re seeing a broader slowdown. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Scott Davis</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just a little bit of a nuance question here, but when I see companies take a step up in investments, discretionary investments, always begs a question of are you catching upon spend or you\u2019re getting ahead of spend. And obviously the nuance there being, if you\u2019re catching up, its\u2019 more of a new normal, if you\u2019re getting ahead its more pulled forward. So do you have a comment on that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. It\u2019s an interesting question Scott, because I think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I think if you look across how broad our portfolio is in a number of operating companies, I\u2019m sure we could find examples of both. But I think largely we try to get ahead. We try to look for those things where based on what we were anticipating in the quarter, we thought we might now have room for and some things where we can use some good discretion about investments that would have some impact on a relatively near term basis. And so clearly I think there could always be a mix there, but the strategic intent is to look for those things that we knew were right to do, were anticipating that we would do at some point and we wanted to get ahead to try to continue to enhance the growth trajectory of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derik De Bruin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Couple of questions, first one is any pull forwards budget flushing that \u2013 given the tariff issues and just concerned on spending and just net of anything different about spending trends in the quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not that we can see Derik. The order rates looked pretty solid. We said when we spoke in December; we said we had a pretty October and November. That remained consistent in December, and I think in general our businesses are probably a little bit less exposed if you will to budget flush, pull forward, given the 70% recurring revenue which is obviously largely made up of consumables and in some part service. But when 70% of your revenue is driven by that recurring revenue, you\u2019re a bit left whether it\u2019s exposed or vulnerable or however you might want to describe it to a bunch of flush or a pull forward at year end. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I\u2019m sure there could be a couple of circumstances whether it\u2019s a high-end Leica microscope or a couple of things that Beck has left where somebody might do that. But in terms of materially of it, it doesn\u2019t appear that that had much impact. In terms of tariff, I\u2019m not sure that it had much impact at least as we look at our China numbers throughout the course of the quarter. We\u2019re not a significant target, but right now I wouldn\u2019t say in the cross-hairs, at least if you measured that by virtue of the financial impact. We\u2019ve talked already to about $12 million to $13 million of impact per quarter or about $50 million annually with about $30 million of incremental impact in 2019 versus \u201918.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we\u2019re doing some things obviously to try to offset that. But in terms of the impact of that dynamic on orders or pull-forwards, again limited exposure probably to some extent a limited level of even the awareness level at the China end market level. So, nothing to point to specifically at the moment in terms of the impact and orders of volume. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Derik De Bruin</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And just a follow-up question, have you made any decisions in terms of how much debt you\u2019re going to put on the dental spend, and just a question of sort of like at the time of the spend what\u2019s the RemainCo leverage ratio is going to be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say, what we do with Beck with forward there\u2019s probably a good proxy here. Our intention is to launch the dental business with a strong balance sheet with an investment grade rating and ability to use their free cash flow to add incrementally to their portfolio through some inorganic moves, some M&amp;A moves. So, I think our history is probably a good proxy for what we would do going forward. And I think we would do that in a way that also leaves us in perfect shape from a RemainCo perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously we start with a great position here in the beginning of 2019. It\u2019s hard to imagine being in a better shape, but I don\u2019t think that dental given it\u2019s a scale will ultimately impact us in terms of RemainCo being set up to win from a capital deployment perspective. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt McGrew</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Derik may be the simple way to think about it is. We\u2019re at two times, two turns today. If we did the spin today we\u2019d likely do dental at two-turns. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Beuchaw</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Actually maybe we\u2019ll just jump off from the conversation there about dental and the spend which is to a couple of more questions around the assumption there. I guess first off any change to the thought process on timing. I think we all remember before that you guys were able to execute a little faster than initially planned. And as you think about the plan for dental for this year, did you anticipate any impact channel inventory fluctuations, and then maybe last around dental is, as you think about the trajectory of margins there, you clearly put a lot of capital to work driving accelerated commercial investments. How do you think about that line in \u201919?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Talk first about the spend; we\u2019ve said all along we expected it to be in the second half of this year. That is still our expectation right now. I think about it at the [inaudible] and I would probably say it\u2019s \u2013 we did four to kind of right at the mid-point. I think dental is more or like probably, I would call it mid-to-late in the second half. You know as we said when we announced, we want to continue to see this market stability. We are encouraged by the fourth quarter performance clearly and deposit sell-out data, but I\u2019d like to see a bit more of that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we need to obviously make absolutely certain that the business is ready to stand up on its own and continue to make good progress, and so we\u2019re encouraged by all of that and that\u2019s out just in the last two quarters, we\u2019re really going to have that for much longer than that so we\u2019re making good progress. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">One thing that\u2019s clearly on our mind and you guys have all read about it is, the federal government in Washington has reopened, but the shutdown certainly help our timing for IPOs and spends. You probably read in the news the backlog in SEC filings and text ruling and so on so forth are likely going to create some delays. So I think if you put all those things together we\u2019ll continue to make progress. But we need to be aware of some of those factors. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the channel inventories and your question about that and being influx, we worked really hard over the last couple of years to ensure that we built sustainable processes in partnership with our channel customers, our channel partners to ensure that we have great visibility and transparency around those channel inventories. We talked a lot about that over the last couple of years and have been key to ensuring that we have those channel inventories in good shape for all of our benefit, for both the benefit of our customers as well as ourselves is to make sure that we good transparency and visibility. And I think we\u2019ve established that and a good dialog month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter with our channel partners. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I feel good about the stability of those. There is obviously always some variability with sell-out at category-by-category, but as a general rule I think our processes are much better as are the processes in the channel. Finally in terms of margins and commercial execution, again we\u2019ve done a number of things here that we feel good about in terms of driving performance. First of all the cost structure is in much better shape that it was three to four years ago. You\u2019ve heard me talk about consolidating from 10 up close to 3 and probably now north of 30% reduction in manufacturing and back office facility. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the cost structure is in better shape, but we\u2019re continuing to invest significantly in new product innovation. That will normalize a bit as we go forward, and I think you combine that with the impact in terms of continued topline improvements and that leads us to really continuing to be very positive about our long term growth and margin opportunities and the platform. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I think we expect to see some modest growth and core OMX here in the first quarter. But we also expect that to continue to improve throughout the course of the year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steve Beuchaw</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Got it, really helpful, and then just one quick follow-up. You\u2019ve flanged a couple of times and it\u2019s very true that the business has transformed significantly over the last couple of years, faster growth, some changes inorganically that have been really helpful. And so I have imagine if you feel maybe better now than you did even a couple of years ago about your ability to drive growth for target investments. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">When you think about 2019, maybe we\u2019ll set aside the inorganic, but think about where you can drive organic investments, and what are your top priorities? And then I\u2019ll get back in the queue. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think we\u2019ve got a number of priorities, but clearly they would be consistent with where we\u2019ve invested really over the last couple of years. We\u2019ve invested significantly in our diagnostic platform organically. I\u2019ve talked about new products that are now having an impact at places like Beckman Diagnostics. We continue the investment rates at Cepheid sustaining those double digit growth rate both in terms of investments and instrumentation, the evolution of the architecture as well as the expansion of the menu. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In life science as well, we continue to make investments; a number of organic investments, but of course inorganic has played a key role there. And obviously with a back on those investment businesses like Pall that have helped to transform the platform, but even as recently as this past year, with the additions of IDT and LabSite, those inorganic moves are not to be overlooked in terms of their impact on improving the growth rates. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But water quality and PID are making investments as well. Those new CIJ printers at Videojet that are helping us to drive connectivity and enhancing our service offering to customers is having an impact on sustaining that growth rate at PID and Videojet specifically, and water quality investing in things like the CM130, opening up a whole new market like dialysis testing where water plays a critical role, those are having an impact. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now the investment may not be as material there as what might go on say at a new platform at Beckman, but before it has an impact when we roll those things out to the market. So, it\u2019s broad-based but I think within a given platform for an operating company it\u2019s very specific relative to new product innovations that we think can have a material impact on growth rates. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Welcome to Matt in your new role. Just a first question around environmental and applied, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been touched on yet. Wondered if you could give any update on how you\u2019re seeing all that happens that, particularly in some of the more industrial weighted businesses and also flipping over to Pall, what are your expectations for the microelectronics unit there given the CapEx seems to be coming down?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. So let\u2019s start with environmental and applied, just broadly, a very good quarter, really driven by a consistent performance in PID and terrific performance across water quality and specifically at Hach. I think those businesses are tracking quite well. They are to your question, each of those businesses, including Pall; represent some of the limited industrial exposure that we have. I mentioned to Scott on earlier question that we\u2019re not necessarily a terrific proxy in terms of the industrial side with about probably less than 10% of the portfolio being at Pall Industrial and Hach Industrial and PID Industrial. And so our sense is, we could see some moderation there in 2019, but in general the underlying trends remain pretty solid. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re necessarily making any kind of macro call here. But given where we are in the cycle, it wouldn\u2019t be unheard of that we\u2019d see those limited pockets of industrial exposure perhaps soften up a little bit. You know so far so good, Pall Industrial, for example, fourth quarter we\u2019re up high single digits and orders were in a similar range two years stack. Hach Industrial pretty good number, PID numbers, pretty solid. So we\u2019ll continue to watch that carefully. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specific to your question about Pall and the microelectronics market, that has been a phenomenal market for Pall over the last few years since we\u2019ve been in the business, and so I think it still is pretty solid today as we look at those growth rate, but again I do not think it would be unusual given some of what we\u2019re read about in terms of the let\u2019s just call it the consumer electronics market and similarly what you\u2019ve read about some of the impacts in China to see a little bit of a moderation there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s been tremendous so far, but we\u2019re not ignorant of the headlines. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt McGrew</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And that\u2019s also a business Julian. That micro-e business is a business; it\u2019s got a lot less consumables that some of our businesses kind of giving it a little bit more of that cyclicality as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Julian Mitchell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then my second question is around margins, one with the \u2013 kind of a follow-up on the dental question and that should we expect the step up in investment to step back down materially once the spin happens. So you will see in the first 12 months of dental as a standalone company, maybe a decent margin tailwind from that? And then some wide, if we think about the core margins, as you said they were down slightly in Q4, do we expect those to rebound in the first quarter, maybe some of our investment spend firm wise cools off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well on the dental question, you think that there would be a combination of factors that would impact continued improvement in what you see in dental margins. Some of that would be some moderation in the investment spend around new products, because again as I mentioned, we try to be very focused on continuing to set that business up to grow, not only in terms of the investments we\u2019ve made in our digital platforms because of the importance of digital dentistry going forward, but certainly the investments that we\u2019re making in the Clear Aligner business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, some of those may moderate slightly. In the cases of Clear Aligners those actually would probably be sustained. So a bit of a mix there. But again I think in general, in terms of the value creation opportunities of the dental platform, continued improvement in growth and profitability we feel good about those trajectories. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in terms of core margins more broadly, I think there\u2019s an impact here as Matt mentioned earlier around FX and tariffs here in the first quarter. As Matt mentioned probably $0.05 to $0.06, and so those will tail walk, we\u2019ll see better margin performance the deeper we get in to the year, but we\u2019d start out in the most challenging part of the calendar for certain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So first a question on growth investments and gross margin, when I think of opportunistic growth investments and the impact on the income statement, I typically look to the R&amp;D and SG&amp;A lines. That said, it looks like there was some impact at the Cogs line this quarter. Is that right and if so can you provide a little bit of detail on what you did and what you expect the returns to be this year? I\u2019m at a high level trying to get a handle on how gross margin was impacted by these investments versus things like FX and tariffs. So that\u2019s another component of the question as well. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Matt McGrew</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure Doug. So I think some of the things that we kind of have done is when you think about some kind of cost pull-forwards if you will, specifically around maybe some supply chain related things etcetera like that. I think we saw some of that probably most pronounced in diagnostics, specifically at Beckman Diagnostics. And then also if you think about some of the new product ramps, kind of capacity if you will with Spark at dental and some of our other new product accelerations where you kind of building up for that first time to the degree that we\u2019re able to kind of pull some of that forward here from 2019 and get some of that worked out a little bit earlier to kind of have a more impactful launch and timing some of that with the sales and marketing as well. So you\u2019re kind of holistically planning to pull forward and get a launch out a little quicker. So I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of both that R&amp;D, sales and marketing and those items that impact cost. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think Doug also, its\u2019 important to think about the situation in the fourth quarter, where again as the quarter progressed we\u2019re seeing the continued good performance on the topline and so we look broadly where there are those opportunities to take advantage of growth investments, and that is one of those fortunate circumstances, it doesn\u2019t happen every quarter obviously, but you look to take advantage of those things because it benefits you both on the short term and in the long term basis and we are clearly not holding back. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s super helpful, and then just a couple of small, unimportant, quick follow-up sun shine. I know that this may not apply to you as much as some other folks, but I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve had any success passing along price the offset tariffs in China, and then at a higher level I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019d be willing to share what the growth rate for China is that you\u2019ve embedded in to 2019 guidance? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Tom Joyce</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I would say price broadly defined is achieved across our portfolio largely on the consumables side. It\u2019s a little bit more challenging given the competitive sets in our businesses on the equipment side. So we generally get it on consumables and that\u2019s both true probably broadly and in China. I would not necessarily associate what we\u2019re getting in terms of price which has been very consistent with inability to have us on specific to the tariffs. The tariffs obviously are coming in other commodities than that which impacts our consumables business. So we\u2019re certainly not having a specific conversation with customers about that. But our in general we\u2019re trying to get price on a global basis, and in general we\u2019re on the consumable side. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then in terms of growth rates, you\u2019ve heard me mention already today about the consistency of our performance in China in terms of what our expectations are for this year. We embedded an assumption that China would continue to be a high single digit kind of growth rate and could very well be right up there at double-digit growth rate, but I think high single is probably the right way to think about it. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Matt Gugino for any additional or closing remarks. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Matt Gugino</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Christy, and thanks everyone for joining us.
