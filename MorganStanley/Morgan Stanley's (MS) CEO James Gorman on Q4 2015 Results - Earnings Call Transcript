This is Kathleen McCabe, Head of Investor Relations. During today\u2019s presentation, we will refer to our earnings release, financial supplement, and strategic update, copies of which are available at www.morganstanley.com. Today\u2019s presentation may include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our notices regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release and the strategic update. This presentation may not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent.</p> <p>I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.</p> <p><strong>James Gorman</strong></p> <p>Thank you, Kathleen. Good morning, everyone. Given the amount of information we\u2019re going to cover on this call, we\u2019re happy to extend the Q&amp;A a few minutes as needed to insure you get your questions in. In a minute, I\u2019ll take you through the 2016/2017 outlook and plan, but before I do so let me touch briefly on the fourth quarter.</p> <p>Clearly the difficult environment that began midsummer continued through the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding that, equity sales and trading and Investment Banking were strong, and Wealth Management and Investment Management were solid. We acted on those things within our control by initiating a major restructuring affect, conducting a large reduction in force in December, reducing our<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> compensation-to-revenue ratio, launching a large scale firm-wide expense initiative, more on that later, significantly reducing RWAs impact to $136 billion, well below our target of $180 billion, and closing the sale of our oil merchanting business.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Finally, we put in place the leadership team to<span class=\"paywall-full-content no-summary-bullets invisible\"> drive the team forward over the next several years. On that, I look forward to having Colm join me as our President. He brings highly complimentary skills and will help take this firm to the next level. The previous appointments of Ted Pick as Global Head of Sales and Trading, Dan Simkowitz as Head of Investment Management and Jon Pruzan as CFO are hard evidence of our deep and talented bench.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Finally, Sam Kellie-Smith, will run fixed income and commodities working for Ted. In light of these changes, it was expected that Greg Fleming would pursue opportunities away from Morgan Stanley. We thank Greg for all he is done, and wish him well for the future. Our bench in Wealth Management is particularly strong. Andy Saperstein and Shelley O\u2019Connor have over 40 years experience in that business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Shelley previously ran the field organization, a position Andy also previously held as well as running products. Colm will help oversee Wealth Management and of course it is a business have a very long history in. Building a first-class leadership team is among my most important responsibilities. I\u2019m delighted we made these decisions, and look forward to a period of stability with this team. Now our entire focus is on driving results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Please, if you will, turn to the slides that you can find on the Investor Relations website. After I go through these Jon will take you through the quarter in more detail then we\u2019ll both take your questions. Let\u2019s start with Slide number 3. As you can see, as a result of many changes, our business mix is much more balanced with complimentary franchises in Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our Institutional Securities business, we have maintained our leadership positions in Investment Banking and equity sales and trading, as illustrated on Slide 4. In equity sales and trading, we\u2019re first among global peers as of the third quarter year-to-date. We\u2019ve built on the momentum of recent years under the leadership of Colm and Ted, with full year revenues ex-DVA of $8.1 billion, up 18% year-over-year. In banking, we continue to see strength and finished second in global announced M&amp;A and number one in IPOs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 5 recaps what we laid out last year and our results. In Wealth Management, we achieved a full-year profit margin of 22%, with pre-tax earnings of $3.3 billion, a record for this business. We expect to see further growth in Wealth Management. We grew our U.S. banks\u2019 net interest income by 46% year-over-year in a flat rate environment. However in fixed income and commodities, we failed to improve on our financial results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">While we\u2019ve been reshaping fixed for several years, the volatile and shrinking revenue pool coupled with the steady increase in capital requirements led us to take further significant action at year end. Through our recently announced FIC restructuring, we will better align the capital and resources committed to the business with the opportunity we see. Through the year, our funding costs benefited from the realization of our funding tailwind, as the debt we issued was at much tighter spreads than the post-crisis debt that matured. We will continue to see benefit from the associated going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We maintained our focus on expense management and achieved a full-year ISG compensation ratio ex-DVA of 37%, below our stated goal of 39% or less. And finally, we increased our common dividend by 50% and increased our buyback from $1 billion to $2.5 billion. We intend to further increase capital return to shareholders in the years ahead, subject of course to regulatory approval. As you can on page 6, our ROE for 2015 excluding DVA and the discrete tax benefits were 7% on a capital base of $67 billion. We remain committed to our 10% ROE target. Obviously that gap is a function of both earnings and equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 7 we layout the key elements of our plan for achieving returns of 10% or greater. These include capital sufficiency, expense efficiency, Wealth Management revenue growth and capital returns to shareholders. These of course are in addition to the continued improvements across Institutional Securities and Investment Management. Since 2012, we have made significant progress in derisking our balance sheet on flat assets. This is shown on Slide 8. We continued to accrete common equity, despite continued increase in capital returns to shareholders. We believe our robust equity base coupled with a derisk balance sheet and a transformed business mix, provides a strong foundation to support our current plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As shown on Slide 9, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.1% and pro forma supplemental leverage ratio of 5.8% are well in excess of their prospective requirements. Building a very strong capital base has been a critical part of our strategy, as evidenced by our ratios. By comparison in the first quarter of 2014, our pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio under the advanced approach was 11.6% and our pro forma supplemental leverage ratio was just 4.2%. We await clarification on the impact in timing of the G-SIB buffer and CCAR. When that clarity is provided, we believe we will be near the end of supervisory changes and therefore our capital is appropriately sized to support our business going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to fixed income and commodities on Slide 10. Notwithstanding considerable efforts to reduce the capital required to support FIC, further regulatory changes in recent years and a prolonged difficult environment led us to believe that much more radical actions were necessary. We have reset the long-term RWA target for FIC at $110 billion, and a setting an SLR exposure target of $250 billion. As a result, we are confident that going forward this business will require $5 billion to $8 billion less capital. Over time where possible, excess capital will be returned to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On Slide 11, we give more details on the FIC restructuring. Given the cyclical, and in some cases structural challenges facing fixed income, driven by the work Colm and Ted did at the end of last year, we took the decision to downside headcount by 25%, along with our ongoing balance sheet and capital focus. We took this action alongside the recent installation of a new management team with the objective of credibly sizing of the business going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our emphasis will be where we have traditional strengths. We have competitive advantages in micro products, specifically in corporate credit connecting to our Investment Banking franchise, as well as the mortgage product and in macro product such as structured rates, and certain electronified FX product, which we will appropriately resource. Even closer integration with equities and banking within Institutional Securities, and in partnership with Wealth Management against our core client base, will allow us to enhance asset velocity and ultimately optimize wallet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s turn to expense discipline, beginning on Slide 12. As a management team, our number priority is to control what we can control given market realities. In ISG, we previously set our compensation target of 39%, and finished the year at approximately 37%, partly a function of having fewer employees to support the business. We intend to stay at or below 37% in ISG and have also said 2017 targets for Wealth Management and Investment Management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to Slide 13. In addition to our focus on compensation discipline, we have launched a major company-wide initiative called Project Streamline, an effort lead by our CFO Jon Pruzan, and COO Jim Rosenthal, which is designed to identify and implement significant infrastructure expense reductions by the end of 2017. Some of these initiatives are shown here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now is the time to tackle head-on our infrastructure costs and maximize low-cost deployment of talent. We have too many legal entities, too much duplication of operations and processes, and too many employees based in high-cost centers doing work that can sensibly be done in lower cost centers. You will hear a lot more about Project Streamline in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The combination of these efforts will enable us to meaningfully improve our efficiency ratio as shown on Slide 14. Our target expense ratio ex-DVA in 2015 was 79% and we ended the year 77%. Expense management is critically important. As such we have set a net target ratio of 74% in 2017, which translates into $1 billion in expense reductions over the next two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In setting this efficiency ratio, we have assumed flat revenues for 2016 and 2017. To be clear, we do not expect the revenue environment to apply, especially given ongoing growth initiatives like Lending and Wealth Management; however, we believe this assumption is appropriately conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s turn to Wealth Management on Slide 15. We continue to see strong high quality loan demand on our Wealth Management client base. We have significantly reduced client penetration and increase client penetration in security space lending and residential lending over the last three years, but we remain substantially underpenetrated relative to our peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For example, only 1.9% of our clients have a mortgage loan through Morgan Stanley. Increased penetration of all loans will drive $20 billion of lending growth through 2017. A highly scalable business like Wealth Management enables us to add sources of revenue with lower compensation payouts such as net interest growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Slide 16 aggregates the medium-term opportunities in Wealth Management. To provide granularity, we lay out three areas where we see obvious potential of margin improvement assuming stable markets. From today\u2019s level of 22%, we see margin potential of 23% to 25% in 2017 through one loan and deposit growth, two expense discipline, and three normal course of business growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In addition, it\u2019s worth reminding investors that when we completed the Smith Barney transaction, we put in place a retention program that amortized over nine years. That amortization will be completed in January 2019 and will add an additional 150 basis points of margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 17. As I have said earlier, we believe we are sufficiently capitalized. Subject to regulatory approval, we intend to increase our payout to shareholders in the coming years just as we have done in the last four years. Let me now turn to Slide 18, the final slide. This sets forth ROE targets for 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Over the past several years, our returns have been depressed by very high litigation expenses in penalties. The need to build a strong capital base resulting in material capital growth every year. The cost of integration of the largest acquisition in wealth management history. The challenging fixed income markets against which we\u2019ve carried outsized capital levels. The restructuring of our merchant bank and of course the enormous cost in capital brought about by the post-crisis regulatory environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We see the next several years very differently. We\u2019ve identified one $1 billion of tangible expense savings. We believe the bank strategy will be a significant driver of earnings growth in wealth management and for the firm. We expect equities and IBD to remain strong and grow revenues assuming global economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we believe Investment Management is now positioned for growth. Most importantly we believe our capital is strong and our ongoing balance sheet reductions will free up more capital for distribution or where that is not possible, reinvestment into our high return businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a result, we\u2019re setting a 2017 ROE target of 9% to 11%. This assumes no material new capital requirements, no outside new litigation expenses or penalties and a global economy, that evidences growth not turmoil. Either way, in a flat revenue environment, we will reduce run-rate expenses by $1 billion on an annual basis beginning in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me now turn to Jon, who\u2019ll briefly touch on the fourth quarter. Then together we would take all of your questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Jon Pruzan</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, James. Good morning. I will keep my comments brief, so we have ample time for Q&amp;A. The fourth quarter of 2015 proved to be a continuation of the third quarter in many ways with mid-quarter volatility and macro concerns driving clients to the side lines after relatively constructive markets early in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In a volatile environment, we benefited from the strength of our equities, investment banking and wealth management businesses. Against this backdrop, revenues were $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $7.9 billion excluding DVA, up 7% versus 3Q 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Non-interest expenses for the quarter were $6.3 billion. Our effective tax rate was 34.5% for the quarter, driven by our geographic mix of earnings throughout the year. For the full year 2015, our tax rate excluding the discrete tax benefits from the first quarter was 32.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now to the businesses. In a challenging environment for some of our institutional security business, overall revenues ex-DVA were $3.5 billion, up 2% quarter-on-quarter. Non-interest expense was down 11% versus the third quarter. Compensation expenses were $1.2 billion down 7% quarter-over-quarter. Excluding DVA, the ISG compensation ratio was down for the quarter, which brought our full year ratio to 37%. Non-compensation expenses were $1.6 billion for the quarter, down 13% driven by lower litigation costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In investment banking, continued strength in our M&amp;A business and better performance in equity underwriting helped to offset weakness in debt underwriting. For the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion in revenues up 3% sequentially. Advisory revenues for the quarter were strong at $516 million, but down 7% from the post 2008 high we achieved last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to underwriting, equity underwriting revenues were $352 million up 41% versus the third quarter, primarily reflecting increases in IPOs. We continued to see pressure from volatility in fixed income underwriting volumes and revenues were $346 million, down 7% versus the third quarter, driven by decreases in loan fees partially offset by investment grade bond fees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The fourth quarter was a continuation of the strength we have seen all year in equity sales and trading as clients remained active and we delivered across products and regions in a volatile market. Ex-DVA, revenues for the quarter were $1.8 billion up 3% sequentially. For the quarter, cash equity revenues were higher versus comparable quarters, as we gained share across regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our prime brokerage business continued to demonstrate leadership, with revenues up quarter-over-quarter as we stayed closely engaged with our clients. Derivative revenues were down quarter-over-quarter against challenging market conditions but up year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Fixed income and commodity sales and trading continue to under-perform in a difficult environment, characterized by spread widening in various products and lower levels of client activity. For the quarter revenues were $550 million, excluding DVA, down 6% versus the third quarter. Revenues in securitized products and credit continued to be negatively impacted by the environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Rates revenues in the quarter were up sequentially, while FX was down driven by lower market volatility and lower client engagement. Commodity results were down quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by our oil merchanting business. We closed the sale of this business on November 1. Given the sale of our two large physical oil businesses, we would expect to see less seasonality in our first quarter FIC results going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, average trading VaR for the quarter was $46 million, down from $53 million last quarter, driven by a reduction in interest rates and credits spread as well as commodities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In our wealth management business, we continue to see steadiness, for the quarter and for the full-year 2015, we saw average revenues per day of approximately $60 million with no day below $50 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Revenues for the quarter were $3.8 billion, excluding the impact of differed compensation plan investments in both periods revenues were approximately flat sequentially. In the quarter, we continued to benefit from our deposit deployment strategy with net interest income increasing 4% from fourth \u2013 third quarter and full-year net interest income of $3 billion up 26%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Funded lending balances in wealth management grew approximately $3 billion or 6% during the quarter and $12 billion or 31% year-over-year. Growth in NII helped offset some of the quarter\u2019s headwinds including the 5% decline in asset management revenues, which was a function of the third quarter\u2019s lower S&amp;P level. We continued to see muted overall activity in transactional revenues, excluding the impact of DCP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the expense side, compensation was up 6% quarter-over-quarter due largely to the offsetting impact of the expense associated with DCP investment James mentioned earlier. Non-compensation expenses were up 6% driven by typical 4Q seasonality. Our PBT margin for the quarter was 21% ex-severance down slightly versus 3Q 2015 though up year on year. For the full-year, PBT margin was 22% in wealth management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Deposits in our bank deposit program were $149 billion at year-end up $10 billion versus the third quarter reflecting normal seasonality in deposits as well as client\u2019s moving to cash in a volatile market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And in Investment Management revenues were $621 million up significantly quarter-over-quarter driven by traditional asset management, which was up 5% as well as stronger performance in merchant banking and real estate investing, where revenues were $211 million versus a loss in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Performance in Investment Management will be impacted by the market levels and back drop. So far this quarter market industries around globe are down with many off to their worse start in history. If they remain down through the rest of the quarter we will see an impact in Investment Management performance, particular in our private investing businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Now turning to the balance sheet, total assets were $788 billion at December 31 down from $834 billion at the end of the third quarter. Average balance sheet was $814 billion down from $827 billion in 3Q as clients moved to the sidelines and activity slowed, particular in the second half of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our global liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $203 billion, compared with a $191 billion at the end of the third quarter driven by typical seasonality in deposits. Pro forma fully phased in Basel III advanced RWAs are expected to be approximately $397 billion, down from $434 billion in the third quarter driven by reductions in market RWAs in a slower client environment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $625 million of common stock or approximately 19 million shares, and our Board declared a $0.15 dividend per share. For the full-year, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock or 59 million shares. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to outlook, in the first two weeks, we have seen a significant rise in volatility across market and asset classes and an intense focus on the China economy, market and currency as well as declining oil prices. We have had a reasonable start in sales and trading, as clients have been engaged as they try and navigate this period of volatility and keep their risk positions close to home.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">M&amp;A has remained active. We are cautious however, as prolonged volatility is not conducive to M&amp;A activity. The underwriting calendar has been challenged. The capital market\u2019s pipeline is healthy, but market volatility could delay new issues coming to market. And on the retail side, clients remain cautious. It\u2019s way too early to predict how the rest of the quarter unfolds and we are tightly managing our risk positions along with our clients. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, we will open the line to questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Indiscernible]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Just a quick one on the reduction, it\u2019s actually not a quick one. On [indiscernible] RWA and FIC that you laid out in the deck. So what should we think about as far as timing, obviously you laid out the year-end 2017? But is there a way to think about the curve over the next two years, as we progress. And how should we think about the revenue that would be tied to that capital and how it might be recycled throughout the organization if not returned to shareholders. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good opener, Brennan. Let me start by saying first, we\u2019ve laid out RWA targets, so there \u2013 for I think the last three years and going back I still remember a number like $392 billion or there about in around the third quarter of 2011 in FIC. So we are light years from that. And last year, we thought we had achieved $180 billion and as you can see, we ended materially lower than that. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the exact timing of year-end and the trajectory year-end 2017, I can\u2019t really help you. We\u2019re going to do it opportunistically. We\u2019ll do with sort of minimum damage. We don\u2019t want to get rid of assets on a distressed basis. We have some natural roll off. So we feel very comfortable with these targets. And it\u2019s fair to say we haven\u2019t disappointed in the last few years. That hasn\u2019t been an issue in FIC. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As it relates to the capital with just arithmetically, if you run these numbers through the models, it does actually free up that much capital. It just means the business doesn\u2019t need that capital. Our view is that we were overcapitalized that our balance sheet was too big in the business given the revenue and business opportunity. We now \u2013 and we were over expensed frankly by taking out 25% of the head count and with that the expenses on compensation, the project streamline that would now work on some of the infrastructure pieces by now reducing the RWAs and the SLR Exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We will reduce the amount of capital tied up in that business. How that is redeployed is a really good question. Obviously, overtime we expect, we\u2019ll deliver that back to shareholder. That\u2019s the current plan. We don\u2019t control all of the pieces of that plan. We are a regulated institution. We have been through CCAR or SCAR I think five times. And every time we\u2019ve asked for a buyback or dividend. Our request has been met. It\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ll continue to ask for buybacks and dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And where we can\u2019t use that capital if it\u2019s sort of track capital for some period of time which some of it maybe. There are clearly other businesses that can use the capital sensibly. We have very high return businesses in both Investment Management and Wealth Management. Clearly, we can use the capital to support our growth in those businesses. As indeed we have had very high returns in our equity franchise. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I don\u2019t know, is that helpful? But it\u2019s hard to lay out a more specific timeline for the balance sheet now that be already runoff than what we\u2019ve given here with the instate and with the year-end 2017. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s fair, that\u2019s fair. Thanks, James. I guess is there any way that we could think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about revenue, because obviously if you are going to take that much capital out, right. You are going to have a very different business. You talked about focusing on some of the strengths a few business lines maybe you could help us think about which businesses you are going to be deemphasizing and how much revenue you think realistically could come out as a result of that. And then finally, how that translates into margin for the business overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I don\u2019t think I can give you the margin translation at this point. And let me address some of the other issues and then I\u2019m sure, Jon may want to add to it and you\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from Ted on the leadership team, probably in the first quarter, one of the investment conferences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the basic position we are in was we had more balance sheet and more capital in the business than we were generating revenues on. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be great revenue diminution from this point given where we finished 2015, which frankly as we said we are very candid that was disappointing. What we\u2019re doing is reducing the path of fixed income, where frankly we didn\u2019t see the revenue opportunity over the last 12 and 24 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve always said as we said on the call we\u2019ve always had a good micro business, a good credit business that remains good. We\u2019ve been very good in the more sophisticated structure rates. We\u2019re reducing obviously our exposure and liquid rates. We\u2019ve never been a major FX trader and we\u2019ve focused on the major currencies there, not the not the non-G10 currencies. And then, regionally we sort of picked our shots through distressed and high yield in various other places around the globe where we think we need to be overemphasized relative to under. The net of it will be more of a U.S.-focused business, a slimmer business when it comes to some of the macro products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t know John if you want to add at this point anymore details on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, the one thing I would add is just to give you a better sense of some of the things we are getting out of as James mentioned, most of that is not in the U.S. Things like sovereign CDS, some of the non-core European currencies, Asia distressed trading, some of the bespoke [ph] correlation products as well as all of the work we\u2019ve done on our commodities business in terms of the oil merchanting businesses as well as the announcement regarding our European power and gas last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So a smaller footprint, less capital, less expenses and better margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And on a personal note, Brennan have to apologize I\u2019ve called you Brendan, I think, three earnings calls in a row, so my apologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No worries, James, that\u2019s all right I\u2019ve been called worse. And then finally another one here real quick. When we think about your ROE goal, right ultimately which you referenced early on in the deck many times as 10% and then, we think about 2017 showing the 9% to 11%, can you maybe square how that\u2019s a little bit different, just is it that the transition may not be complete by 2017. How is it we should think about that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">You know, our goal remains to achieve returns above our cost of capital. Clearly whether our cost of capital is actually 10% right now, but let\u2019s take that for granted for the moment. Our goal is to achieve returns above that. Clearly we can\u2019t be that precise, I mean, this is a highly variable set of revenues that we have in these businesses as we are seeing in the markets today versus Friday, for example. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re expressing it as a range but you\u2019ll note the mid point of that range is indeed 10%. We aren\u2019t backing off of the goals, in fact for the first time we\u2019ve put a timeline against it and as we laid out what the key drivers of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Obviously, it\u2019s with the appropriate caveat which you would expect if we have a major outsized litigation expense or penalties that are unforeseen if the markets completely collapse here if we have no revenue growth, if the Fed responded very differently to our capital plans than what we intended it gets harder. On the other side if we have stronger revenue growth, we meet our expense targets, we do our capital plan, we\u2019re confident about, certainly about the range and our target is the mid point of that range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Brennan Hawken</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s fair enough. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, thanks very much. I guess the follow-up on FICC. Just curious what you think the net of all of the moves might be in terms of how you think about your G-SIB buffer and then how it might factor in just in general to your ability to return that excess capital. I heard your comments about redeploying if you aren\u2019t allowed but it seems like your RWA reduction and then the costs that go along with it is kind of what builds the buffer but just curious to get some detail on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In thinking about capital, I mean, problem number one is having enough capital. At 4.2 supplemental leverage ratio which was just I think the beginning of 2014. I\u2019m looking John is nodding 2014, clearly we weren\u2019t there. So problem number one has been solved we\u2019ve clearly got enough capital on any metric that you measure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Problem number two is then if you continue to accrete capital what is the sensible buyback dividend and total payout ratio that you\u2019ve put against that. And then opportunity number three is as you reshape the business mix and move to a less capital intensive parts of the business, you by definition are throwing off more capital than you\u2019ve had the day before you did that, what are you able to do with that capital?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As to refer to Brennan\u2019s question this isn\u2019t going to happen tomorrow, Glenn, it\u2019s going to happen over as we said a couple of years so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to have a pool of capital to give back tomorrow. But we\u2019re setting ourselves up for increasing returns over the next several years at the same time let\u2019s make investments across the rest of the business. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I don\u2019t know if that helps you, but where it relates to G-SIB buffer, we know what our buffer is. What we don\u2019t know is how the Federal Reserve through the CCAR process is adjusting its models once they put the CCAR buffer in my understanding is there will be adjustments to the models which will tamper that buffer to create a net number which is lower than the buffer for all of the banks. That\u2019s my current understanding. Obviously we have to see that play out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">My understanding is the Federal Reserve had models which were by definition harder than they probably would have had in normal circumstance but that was driven by not having the G-SIB buffer put in place. Now that it\u2019s in place the models will be refined and the net impact is what we will be looking at. So the combined net impact of the G-SIB buffer with these capital reductions from the balance sheet with the amount of capital we are a accreting, we still accrete capital last year gives us a reasonably high degree of confidence that we\u2019re going to be seeing increasing capital returns in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From your lips, all right, just a follow-up on a quickie one on the corporate loan commitments, if you could give any color about the total or the funded loan book, how much of its energy reserves against that? How are you feeling about that book in general.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In general, on the corporate loan book, I think, the focus areas have really been around energy and probably event, particularly in the single-B market. We have seen, on the energy complex we have seen credit migration in that portfolio and as a result, Glenn we\u2019ve increased our allowances. We seen an increase in some negative marks that we take through our \u2013 income statement, as well as increasing our hedges. And we would expect that pressure on that portfolio to persist for awhile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the total size of the portfolio, it\u2019s about $16 billion of both funded and unfunded, this is energy now. That\u2019s down from $17 billion in the third quarter. Of that $16 billion, I would say 60% is investment grade, or excuse me it\u2019s to investment grade counter parties and only about 30% of that $16 billion is funded. Another focus area within the energy portfolio has really been around E&amp;P. In terms of our statistics that portfolio is about $4.4 billion broken down, $1.7 of that is funded to non-investment grade borrowers and about $2.7 billion is still unfunded. That unfunded piece is about two-thirds to investment grade borrowers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the reserves and the allowances remember of the $16 billion total energy book approximately 60% of that is held for investment, while 40% is fair value or held for sale. That other portion is mark-to-market and primarily flows through our other revenue line in the ISG in terms of the income statement and has been marked to the current environment. We will continue to monitor that portfolio very closely. We regularly stress test it. We\u2019re watching for signs of contagion and we\u2019re hedging accordingly and adjusting our hedges accordingly. So I think that\u2019s the color on the energy exposures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the event again it\u2019s been we\u2019ve seen disruption in that marketplace since August. It\u2019s primarily been focused in the single B part of the market. We have had a handful of loans that got caught in that dislocation and downdraft but again, it is only a handful of loans, a few of which we distributed in the fourth quarter and a few of which we still hold. The losses related to both the syndicated loans as well as the ones that we still hold are also reflected in our fourth quarter results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The double-B and investment grade markets held in pretty well, although the pricing has widened. We see investors wanting to put capital to work in that market but they are being more selective. They are looking at higher quality names and extracting larger new issue concessions, but in terms of outlook we continue to under write new commitments predominantly in the double-B space and the investment grade space and that reflects the current environment. So again, those two areas of energy and event we\u2019ve been highly focused on and containing and managing that position as best we can.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Outside of that we haven\u2019t really seen much contagion. Wealth management book still stays and looks pretty good. It remains stable, strong credit quality no real changes in those metrics, commercial real estate portfolio also haven\u2019t seen real signs of weakness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Glenn Schorr</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks for that, a lot of detail. Good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning. Just to follow-up and stay on the topic of corporate credit. And more broadly then the sort of energy E&amp;P type stuff that you talked about where you gave good color. In your experience what are the leading indicators of credit deterioration that you drilled down on broadly away from energy and the commodities [indiscernible], how are they looking right now and is there any reason that you can think of as to why this would be different this time?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s a good question in terms of relative and historical performance. I think we\u2019ve obviously been in a very benign credit environment for awhile. We are starting to see some pressure in the energy complex as I said across the other metrics, particularly for us given the health of our customer base. In the retail side we haven\u2019t seen much stress in those areas. We are increasing the allowance for loan losses, this quarter it\u2019s up to about $70 million, clearly a portion which is energy. So we are seeing a churn in the credit cycle. But again from our book in the way that we look at it, it\u2019s really been focused in, on the on the energy complex right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up question on wealth management. Looking at your Slide 16, the net interest income growth in a range of 75 basis points to 175 basis points of margin contribution, if \u2013 I think you\u2019ll remember that you\u2019ve baked in the forward curve to those assumptions. So where would we be in terms of that range if short-term interest rates stay where they are currently as opposed to actually incorporating the forward curve?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think the right way to think about that, those numbers, I would say, do not require any incremental rise in rates from where we are today. If the forward curve is realized, we will get some incremental benefit, but those margin targets don\u2019t require incremental rate movements. They do require growth in loans that we laid out on the prior page and we\u2019ve had very good momentum in that lending book but it doesn\u2019t require the forward curve to hit those margin targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Guy Moszkowski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Christian Bolu with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So my first question is on the $1 billion cost saves. I\u2019m just trying to gauge what\u2019s incremental versus just rule off one-time as in 2015. So I guess the first question is how much litigation and severance costs did you incur in 2015?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then two, of that $1 billion in cost saves how much of that is roll off of the 2015 litigation and severance cost versus incremental business rationalization?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again of that, $1 billion as James mentioned, that assumes no individual one time significant charges. There\u2019s obviously an element of litigation that\u2019s part of our business. We were happy to see the litigation expense go down in the fourth quarter, but in terms of breaking out those individual numbers, we have historically not done that but again it\u2019s \u2013 it does require no major single individual event.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, just so I\u2019m clear, because I think you put out the numbers in your Qs of just about $500 million of litigation costs through the third quarter and about $150 million in severance, so that\u2019s close to $700 million in cost\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t understand the question. I apologize so again the $550 million number you\u2019re referencing was in the third quarter year-to-date as I said our litigation came down materially in the fourth quarter and the severance of the $150 million was across the firm in the fourth quarter, presumably we won\u2019t have the same level of severance so part of that severance would be embedded in that billion dollars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so what about the litigation are you assuming it\u2019s roughly the same going forward or you assume it comes down from that at least $555 million we had as of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think we believe that the most significant items related to the credit crisis are largely behind us. This quarter it was good to see litigation come down and so I think there is an embedded assumption along those lines but again it\u2019s a lumpy and unpredictable line item.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then my follow-up just on the lending \u2013 on balances I\u2019m just trying to reconcile the current target versus the prior target so you had \u2013 you expected $180 billion in total U.S. Bank assets by the end of 2016. Does that still stand and then how do we think of 2017?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the \u2013 what I would say is the slide in the deck is only in the wealth management segment so it\u2019s not a total lends on the bank. We\u2019ll be coming back to you with more detail throughout the year but in terms of the 2016 number that loan growth that you see out of wealth management would be consistent with those targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Christian Bolu</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, I appreciate the detailed guidance certainly as part of the broader strategic review. It\u2019s always quite helpful to us but some of the early feedback that I just wanted to relay suggests that there\u2019s investors are struggling and quite candidly we\u2019re struggling to reconcile the [indiscernible] to 9% to 11% ROE versus some of the different guidance components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And if we think about a backdrop where there\u2019s 4% annual revenue growth, a 74% efficiency ratio, 32% tax rate, and flat preferreds and non-controlling interest, it gets to you about $6 billion of net income to common and if I even take just the low end of that 9% to 11% ROE range, the implied common equity is about $66 billion which suggests payouts in excess of 100% over the next two years. So I just wanted to get an understanding as to of what elements or components of that analysis might be flawed or needs to be tweaked and how should we \u2013 and what capital return assumptions are embedded in that 9% to 11% ROE target range that you highlighted for 2017?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Let me try to take a swing at this one. So as we laid out on the page, first of all the compensation, the billion dollars plus of compensation and non-comp savings are assuming a flat revenue environment so if we get out two years and we\u2019re flat to today our ratio will be 74%. As James mentioned we do expect revenue growth throughout this period and therefore the efficiency ratio should be lower than the 74% because we do have operating leverage in the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First and foremost, and so I think that is probably the biggest disconnect in your math. You can see in the revenue bucket or the modest revenue growth bucket we do have improvements in different business segments. And then in terms of the capital base, ideally, we believe we have sufficient capital, we had been accreting capital over the course of the last several years. We would expect to probably accrete a little bit more capital over the coming period. But we would like to try to slow \u2013 clearly slowdown the accretion of capital since we have \u2013 we believe we have the appropriate amount of capital for our current plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks. And Jonathan, I think you spend a lot of time talking about capital and obviously it\u2019s going to be contingent on the feedback you get from regulators and presumably they would be inclined or incentivized to reward actions to reduce your systemic risk footprint or exposure system with more risk intensive activities, based on your discussions have you been given any indication that they would be perceptive to higher payouts for those that are willing to shrink more aggressively in those areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t want to get ahead of predicting how regulators are going to think about this. We did what we think is right for our business. Our job is to generate returns to our business; however, arithmetically if you have met all of the capital targets by definition, if you change the structure of your business and throw off additional capital that you know by definition don\u2019t need that all will be available for returns. Do I think that there is going to be one-time major dividend in the next 12, 18 months. No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible but do I believe that we\u2019re going to be in a position where we increase our returns, absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And you\u2019ve seen banks that have generated payouts above 100% for this reason, for that they are accreting more capital than they need for their business. That\u2019s before you get to banks that have actually restructured their business in the phase of the new business reality. So again I don\u2019t want to get ahead of them \u2013 that would not be a smart thing to do but I do think our strategy is pretty clear and it\u2019s certainly consistent with where the regulatory push has been.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Steven Chubak</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Right, that\u2019s very helpful.

But what is that on a tangible ROE basis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Mike, we\u2019ve got about little over $9.5 billion of goodwill and intangibles, so on our capital base, somewhere around 125 basis points, above those numbers just math.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right, so the target on a tangible basis is 10% to 12%?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We have an ROE target of 9% to 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">For all of our common equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what\u2019s the need behind this target, I mean is it just a target that sits there or is management paid off this? What\u2019s the follow through from this target to the organization?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Not totally sure, I understand your question. All of our employees are bonus eligible paid in stock. The stock is generally performed somewhere in line with ROE and price to book so everybody is affected by that. The most senior management team I receive as part of their compensation performance units which are directly affected too by ROE and total shareholder return so that\u2019s very specific for the senior team. But we are not doing this to frankly drive up our personal comp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re doing it because we think these businesses should be run with returns at or above 10% and nobody in this world predicted the last four or five years of what\u2019s gone in the markets and the amount of capital that would be required to support these businesses when I took this job our capital base was $40 billion, today it\u2019s $69 billion. We\u2019re in a tremendous E position and the challenge has been to get the R moving consistent with that rate of growth of the E.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And what we\u2019ve done here is to frame it for investors because understandably they want to know what is a realistic timeframe just to Steven\u2019s question before what is a realistic timeframe, how do the pieces add up mathematically, to get you there. Are they believable, are they plausible and we thought it might going to be smart to layout what we think is a realistic timeframe that kind of range 9% to 11% 2017, the pieces are we are definitely taking out expenses, some of them are in the bag, if you will.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And some of them are going to be driven by management processes that we put in place. We believe there is revenue growth across many parts of our business over a two year period and we believe we are sufficiently capitalized given the world that we operate in so if you add all those pieces together putting it in terms of a target to help investors have a framework rather than open ended seem to be the right transition point for Morgan Stanley. In the last several years we couldn\u2019t have done that because we couldn\u2019t address some of the issues on the right hand side of that slide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As a follow-up Slide 13, you addressed compensation by each of the three main business areas, but you didn\u2019t give any meat on the non-comp expenses. Can you just elaborate on any specifics there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry. Say that again. We addressed the compensation we didn\u2019t give meat on what?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the non-comp Slide 13, location strategy, leverage technology, consolidated processes, outsourcing. What sort of expense savings could you get from the non-comp areas?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I think what we wanted to frame was the total comp ratio. I\u2019m sorry the total efficiency ratio of 74% and embedded in that was $1 billion of expense savings, which will be function of comp and non-comp. We\u2019re not going to break those out in detail on this call, we are very confident about that as we\u2019re referencing with Steve and there a number of these things, which obviously just go away through reality like the severance costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There is the elevated legal expenses we\u2019ve carried in the last several years, which we think is unlikely to be carried forward. There is the restructuring we did which frankly just changes the run rate of your salaries benefits, medical and the bonus pool for those individuals, and we\u2019ve already initiated a major effort under this project streamline and some of those pieces begin this week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We started with changing our so-called contingent employees or our consultants in far away markets where we\u2019ve achieved the objective of what that would be put to work. We\u2019ve now reduced some of those numbers. And all of those efforts are coming together. So you\u2019ll see a mix of \u2013 and over the next several quarters we\u2019ll give you much more details on the non-comp. So we\u2019re not going to break it out now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then lastly any big restructuring or repositioning charge related to project streamline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No. No.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">All right. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Certainly not that\u2019s visible at this point not that\u2019s planned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Mike Mayo</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks guys. James, just on the FIC side of the business, post restructuring, I know it\u2019s tough to gauge but when you mentioned and you look at the revenue environment and kind of where your run rate now, you wouldn\u2019t expect much of a drop-off. Just wanted to understand is that relative to like the second half of 2015, like total 2015 or is there any way to gauge it from like a return on asset like what you expect in FIC going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">No, I think of that in terms of the full year, obviously the second half but our revenue run rates of $500 million were incredibly low. But we look what the total market size is what our share is, and what our expected share is, and expected market size in the next couple of years and that\u2019s why we say we believe we\u2019re right-sized for revenue rate equivalent to 2015. We obviously \u2013 we\u2019ll be trying to do a lot better than that but we think that\u2019s a plausible outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. And then Jon, just on the \u2013 I guess you mentioned like with the weak markets some of the impact that you can see in investment management. So I guess just two things on that. Last quarter we saw that kind of negative accrual I think on the Asia private equity your Merchant Banking fund [ph], just what type of exposure unit in the investment management business have \u2013 those types of products so we can see those swings. And then in wealth management I feel like the transaction revenues have been pretty weak for a while and that\u2019s more of an industry trend but just wanted to figure out are we stabilizing here, meaning are there pressures there somewhat coming to a slowdown?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, a couple of questions. I think on the investment management question the way I would try to think about it is there basically two major components of how we make business in that \u2013 how we make money in that business, one is just our fee revenues from managing money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And obviously that\u2019s going to be a rate \u2013 that\u2019s a rate times volume equation. So if the amount of money we\u2019re managing goes down that will be impacted by the markets that we\u2019re seeing but that outline is pretty stable. The second line as you said is the investment line. When I refer to the investment line I\u2019m talking about the segment reporting we do in our supplement, that number was negative $235 million last quarter we said that was predominately driven by our reversal of carry in our Asia PE fund or funds. This quarter it was $100 million that return to a positive number was driven by all of our \u2013 most of our investing businesses both private equity infrastructure and real estate that was more balanced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We said in the third quarter when we took the reversal of carry that that eliminated the vast majority \u2013 excuse me, the majority of the carry that we have accrued in our Asia PE businesses we obviously have a carry accrued in other businesses. And that\u2019s disclosed in the queue but the exposure at certainly in Asia has been reduced and the fund that was under stress in the third quarter had no material changes, had no material changes this quarter. That was the first part of your question. I think, the second on transactional revenues. Those numbers have been subdued. Clients are cautious, whether that\u2019s a floor or not is hard to tell given the volatility, but we think that those numbers hopefully have stabilized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Michael Carrier</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, thanks for taking my question. First of all, maybe for you, Jon on page 3 of the supplement, you break out the regional revenues, looks like if we don\u2019t adjust for DVA, the revenues are basically flat in the Americas up double-digit in EMEA and up high single-digit in Asia. How are you thinking about those \u2013 that revenue mix heading into 2016 given all your comments about some of the challenges emanating out of China and some of the growth challenges in Europe?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m just turning to page 3. Before getting that page in front of me, I think the results this quarter, we did see Asia was down, but it continues to be a strong and important part of our business. We did see weakness in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter in Europe given the concerns and uncertainty around Brexit and some of the immigration issues, we still think that Europe although showing some signs of growth in certain areas, is going to be a fragile economy and the drivers of our business will be the U.S. and Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of the third \u2013 page 3, again, don\u2019t have in front of me. Just this minute, but that you should also know is managed, the way we look at the business is on a managed basis, and so those revenues don\u2019t necessarily tied back to the tax rate that I talked about earlier regarding the geographic mix of earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thank you, and then a little closer to home, how are you thinking, it seems that you\u2019re assuming that lending both in the corporate side of things, as well as Within Wealth Management is going to continue at what appears to be roughly similar growth rate as you saw this year. But I guess I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about what appears to be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny both in areas like leverage lending, but also in commercial real estate which seem \u2013 which where you\u2019ve grown quite visibly over the last two years to three years as you\u2019ve pushed on your bank growth program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, Matt, I\u2019m not sure, I wouldn\u2019t agree with that statement, I think historically over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen good growth in both the ISG lending product as well as the Wealth Management lending product and those have been the key drivers along with deploying our deposits away from securities into these loans. Those have been the key drivers of the NII growth historically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I think going forward I would tell you that the primary driver of the lending growth is going to be Wealth Management. The growth assumptions in the ISG part of the business are much lower than they had been over the last couple of years as we built those portfolios up. So the key driver is going to be Wealth Management area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. And then just ripping on that theme, James, you mentioned less than 2% of your Wealth Management clients have a mortgage with Morgan Stanley. What\u2019s your target over the next two years to get that ratio to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t have a target here. We could break out sort of mathematically how it separates and get back to, but I don\u2019t have a target off the top of my head. Obviously, it\u2019s very low single-digit, it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not in the \u2013 about 10%. You can see the numbers on the chart which just show mathematically what the total residential lending is $21 billion, up from $16 billion. So I guess that would imply we did about 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Burnell</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, thanks for taking my questions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. When we think about the 3% to 5% revenue growth with ROE target, yes, some items like NII should increase without the backdrop changing and hopefully will be above that. So on the other hand, investment banking has been operating at a high level as you highlighted, a choppy market could impact those businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So just thinking about, what type of investment banking revenues or environment during that 3% to 5% revenue growth, and sounds like you guys are a little more cautious on the near-term there. So is that fair? And then and how do you think about those businesses broadly relative to their cycle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure, I think first I\u2019d highlighted that 2017 over the target I think. As you say the Wealth Management is being really driven by the lending growth and some of the other initiatives we have there. In terms of both equities and investment banking, listen, we think that we can continue to gain some share there. We have good shares in those businesses, but the backdrop is a constructive one, where the revenue pools are up modestly if we\u2019re in a situation where revenue pools for these products decline precipitously, these are \u2013 that\u2019s not just the backdrop that we set these assumptions. So a little bit of share gain and a little bit of revenue or pie growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, great, helpful. And then just within the Wealth Management comp target that improvement to less than 56%, is that and entirely driven by leverage off of higher margin revenues like NII or are there other core comp expense reductions that they can occur within GWN, the GWN that we should be thinking about?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, I think it\u2019s a mix. I mean, clearly more a non-compensable revenues is helpful for that target. But as we\u2019ve said from a \u2013 for the totality of the firm, we are very focused on expenses and comp and there are some other levers that we can use here other than just the growing non-compensable line item.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Devin Ryan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, yes, good morning. You\u2019ve mentioned how much you\u2019ve bought the fixed income RWAs down from $390 million to like $188 million at the end of last year and down to $136 million now. And I know you can\u2019t comment about this year\u2019s CCAR, but I guess, it just strikes me that given the huge progress you\u2019ve made on bringing down the fixed RWAs, it doesn\u2019t seem like the CCAR process got \u2013 was mitigated somehow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And I wonder if you can talk in a general way again not about this year\u2019s submission, but to what extent is \u2013 are the adverse CCAR results driven by the fixed income businesses or is it throughout the business. And in a \u2013 if the CCAR process this year were static with last year, would the reduction in RWAs that we\u2019ve seen this year have a positive impact on CCAR?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well, I can take out and Jon may want to add something. CCAR is a function, there are five different ratios under the normal scenario and then the severely adverse scenario, where we had an issue to the extent we did was on the total leverage ratio which we addressed with the top preferred securities. So I think was \u2013 CCAR was submitted last November, December I think.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">January.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">James Gorman</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The cycle got moved down this year, an extra three months to April. So the world we\u2019re in 15 months ago, our RWAs were significantly higher. They weren\u2019t where we finished the year at. So it\u2019s sort of an apples and oranges back then, we presented the firm as it was then. This April we\u2019ll be presenting a different firm, although there are various cutoff dates when balance sheet are set and so on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So I don\u2019t really want to get into and I know you didn\u2019t ask for a specific prediction on CCAR, but all we can do is put ourselves in a position where it\u2019s clear we have sufficient capital and any incremental changes we make to the business or any incremental earnings that we accrete by definition become excess capital, whether that flows on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Obviously, it\u2019s something to be considered, when we submit our thing in here from our regulators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Chris Kotowski</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Your final question comes from the line of Fiona Swaffield with RBC. Please go ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi. Just had two areas. One was, you talked about funding benefits, I think it\u2019s $0.4 at the beginning, tailwind from now funding cost. I just wondered if you could talk a bit more about how much that was for 2015 and also where we would see it because I didn\u2019t notice the net interest income in IS was very strong in Q4. I didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s related, so if you could talk about that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then the last area was really on Slide 16, on the deposit assumptions. I have thought that there was a big strategy to increase the deposits. I think I had a number in my head of $200 billion. Has that changed or is it that \u2013 just that you\u2019re not putting that or you\u2019re assuming there\u2019s a length within your 2017 kind of roll forward? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. so the \u2013 Fiona, the two parts of the question, I think on the funding question, there\u2019s obviously a lot of components that go into those lines including the size of our balance sheet, secured versus unsecured. What we said, just to give you some \u2013 to try to cuff it we did about $21 billion of new unsecured last year and those came in at rates that were significantly below where the historical debt had been issued, our average maturity or WAM on our unsecured stack now is about six years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So, we were sort of retiring five year debt and putting on slightly longer, but we saw our credit spreads were easily 100 tighter than where they were before. That process went out through \u2013 that process went on throughout the year. We obviously didn\u2019t refinance all of the debt on day one. So, we will continue to get the benefit from those funding savings as we annualize. And so that, I think addresses question number one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And question number two on the deposits, we will continue to grow our deposit base. I think what we would like to try to do this year and 2016, is try to optimize the deposits. We have different deposits that have different liquidity values. We think we can support the lending growth that we\u2019ve highlighted in the strategy \u2013 excuse me, in the strategy deck without growing our deposit base, but clearly that is a goal, and in 2017 that will be requirement to support our future lending growth. We\u2019ve talked about some of the digital strategy and cash management product that are \u2013 we\u2019re growing out, and that will support \u2013 that will hopefully drive the deposit growth in 2017 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks. Can I just go back to the first thing, and what the explanation of net internet income in IS? Is quarter-on-quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019m sorry\u2026</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Institutional Securities?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Jon Pruzan</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Again, I\u2019ll come back to you on that one, Fiona.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Fiona Swaffield</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay. Thanks so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you.
