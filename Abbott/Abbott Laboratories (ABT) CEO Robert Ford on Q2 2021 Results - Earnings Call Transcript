Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"> Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels in 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all four of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals, nutrition and medical devices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob, and I\u2019ll start with nutrition where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in adult nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we\u2019ve seen two factors positively impact adult nutrition demand. New users are entering category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as a global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we\u2019re making in direct consumer promotion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying diagnostic sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as healthcare systems continue to recover from the pandemic, as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in core laboratory and molecular diagnostics grew mid single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia, and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Lastly, I\u2019ll cover medical devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Strong growth in the quarter was led by structural heart, electrophysiology, heart failure and diabetes care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In structural heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll wrap up with diabetes care, where strong growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately one million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So in summary, we\u2019re achieving strong growth across all four of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we\u2019re seeing from several recently launched products and investments we\u2019re making in our key growth platforms, and our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Bob Funck</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding other aspects of the P&amp;L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&amp;D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&amp;A expense was 25.8% of sales. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Turning to the outlook for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. </p> <p id=\"question-answer-session\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. [Operator instructions]</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins </span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you and good morning. I\u2019ll keep my questions quick and high level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">First, for Robert, I\u2019m just curious on your view on the pace of the recovery in surgical procedures generally. Has it kind of continued throughout the quarter and into July? Or are you starting to see signs that the spread of variants could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? Just wanted to get your views on how things are going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean, we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated, I\u2019d say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I don\u2019t think what we\u2019re seeing here relating to like increase in COVID cases. I don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll see the same, at least we\u2019re not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it\u2019s a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case -- global case counts, they\u2019re pretty much in line to where we were October last year. We\u2019ve got therapeutics, we\u2019ve got vaccines, we\u2019ve got testing, so we\u2019re not seeing that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On the device side, listen, our business has done very well overall, as I said in my comments. We\u2019re up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter of 2019, largely driven by EP, heart failure, structural heart, diabetes as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we\u2019re seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures, as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And we\u2019re looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it\u2019s in the U.S. or whether it\u2019s outside the U.S. generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces. But I\u2019d say, overall, we\u2019re seeing that recovery and that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then my second question for Bob, I\u2019d love you to comment on two things, if okay. One, just you had a nice EPS beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys were driving the quarter, but you\u2019re leaving guidance the same. Just wanted to understand that dynamic. Why not boost the EPS a little bit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">And then secondly, if you - just curious if you think consensus estimates as we look forward a little bit are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing your world right now, and obviously I\u2019m specifically talking about next year. So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it and wondering just about the EPS guidance for this year. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Funck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, Bob, I\u2019ll take the first question on the guidance for this year. Clearly, about a third of that beat was due to the higher COVID sales than we had projected. Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging, and so that was about a third of the beat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">About two-thirds really was better performance of the base business versus how the Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June and that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year, as well as kind of underlying base business performance, so we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think, this is how we\u2019re thinking about the second half of the year. Obviously, from a top line perspective, we\u2019re going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we\u2019re looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a gross margin perspective, we\u2019ll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There\u2019s obviously maybe some friction on some input costs - commodities, freight, et cetera. The team works hard to kind of offset those, so we\u2019ll see improve also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand, and we\u2019ll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&amp;D and SG&amp;A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I\u2019d say, kind of more immediate return. So, for example, direct consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium-term, whether it\u2019s R&amp;D programs or whether it\u2019s kind of getting ready for upcoming launches. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">So the real, I\u2019d say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing, and we gave guidance about a month ago, about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After the two quarters, we\u2019re about $3 billion, $3.5 billion, so we\u2019ve got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next six months. And I think that\u2019s really the question here, is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it\u2019s variants, whether it\u2019s vaccination rates, et cetera, so that\u2019s just something that we\u2019re paying attention to. And as Bob said, that\u2019s why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is believed to account for that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Bob Hopkins</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Oh, great. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a good quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Bob, maybe to follow-up on the last question. There is a lot of moving pieces down the P&amp;L right now. You had a really good operating margin in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you\u2019re thinking of reinvestment of COVID testing revenues, how that\u2019s flowing through the P&amp;L? And if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Bob Funck</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&amp;A and R&amp;D combined, we\u2019re up around $700 million versus the prior year, and we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business. So we haven\u2019t, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter. We\u2019re going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year. That\u2019s going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&amp;D and SG&amp;A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We have some - coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets, we have two interesting ones coming at ESC later in August with CardioMEMS and with Amulet. I was just hoping we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential, and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches given the COVID environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. On Amulet, we talked about this, Robbie - we filed with the FDA late last year. Right now, we plan to present the data at ESC, so that\u2019s in the late August time frame. We think it\u2019s, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us. The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S., we have a 50% market share, so we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Regarding timing, it\u2019s one of those, I can\u2019t give you an exact timing. It\u2019s definitely, we think, in this second half, and then it\u2019s just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year - obviously the impact next year is larger, and then it\u2019s going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously if it\u2019s more towards the back end of the year, then we\u2019ll see less of an impact. If it\u2019s sooner, there will be an opportunity here for us to execute on that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">On CardioMEMS, I guess similar - we think this is another great opportunity. Both these products were products--when we began the St. Jude integration, both these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence of these two products, so it\u2019s great to see we\u2019re in a position now to be able to disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, the end of the second quarter, and again we just think it\u2019s a great opportunity also and probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Robbie Marcus</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please check that you\u2019re not on mute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hey guys, apologies. Congrats on the strong print this morning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Robert, maybe one high level question on the base business. I think there was some confusion this morning on the base ex-COVID versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels. I think you did 11% in 2Q and that was maybe perhaps low double digits in Q1, so the question I think people are asking is, if you had sequential improvements, is the 11 versus 10, that seems a little light, but I think that kind of ignores the business mix. Maybe perhaps, can you talk about what\u2019s happening in the device business, what was the sequential acceleration, and what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I think med device kind of grew, again, Q2 versus 2021. That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said in the first question. Obviously the recovery is not uniform across all businesses, so if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in neuromodulation, where I\u2019d characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures, and we\u2019ve seen, I\u2019d say a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say for example, structural heart and EP, or a diabetes business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Similar to diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that\u2019s grown high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that\u2019s an improvement versus where were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our diagnostic business is we\u2019re seeing a slower recovery in blood donations, and that obviously impact our transfusion business, so kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seeing a bit of a slower recovery. But I\u2019d say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 last year, I\u2019d say they\u2019ve largely recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful, and then maybe one on the product side, on CardioMEMS, [indiscernible]. It looks like it\u2019s an interesting trial. It\u2019s a pretty large trial - I think 3,600 patients enrolled, that\u2019s fairly large. I guess assuming in some of these results, if they were to mimic Champion, the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations, I think mortality is an end point here. Should CardioMEMS be a multi-billion dollar product for Abbott, and the reason I\u2019m asking is historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggest some optimism, so I\u2019m curious how you guys are thinking about the longer term opportunity. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I think a lot of these device segments that we see large opportunities, I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to create a strong market development approach here. When we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there was some issues with reimbursement in CMS, certain of the [indiscernible] weren\u2019t reimbursing, etc., and you had positive Champion data - I\u2019m aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there was also plenty of real world evidence showing similar benefits, similar results that you had observed in Champion, so we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of Champion and/or augment the data set. I\u2019m hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay, but I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we\u2019re building our heart failure portfolio, together with our LVAD portfolio, and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it, and I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intention about investing, whether it\u2019s trial, whether it\u2019s clinical and field-based teams to drive it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class 4 presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market, and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BMP, so I think that this is a great opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I guess your comment on mortality, I think that\u2019s important, but I also know in talking to health systems that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you\u2019re just kicking the can down the road, but I think that if you look at and have conversations with the healthcare systems, they\u2019ll see this is an important reduction. Any reduction in hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them, so bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we\u2019re being intention about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption, so that we can get to numbers that you\u2019re referencing or even bigger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Vijay Kumar</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful, thanks guys.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just two for me. I\u2019ll start with Libre.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Robert, just maybe at a high level, your thoughts on the road map for Libre from here, given that you\u2019re closing in on a billion dollars a quarter in sales. More specifically, any update on the launch of Libre 3 in Europe and how delays at FDA might impact the timing of Libre 3 in the U.S.? I have one follow-up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Listen - we had a real strong quarter, as you saw and as you mentioned, approaching that billion-dollar mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base, and this is a different device business. We talk about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let\u2019s say niche versus the size of Libre. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But the user base is super important because when you\u2019ve got this kind of retention level that we\u2019re seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90%-plus globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model, and when you\u2019re in that subscription-like model and you\u2019ve got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. I think that\u2019s a lot of our focus right here as we talk about this mass market, is building the user base, and I think we\u2019ve done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But as we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve got 3.5 million users, I\u2019ve talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million user potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and Type 2s, etc., so I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us and we\u2019re still in the early innings, as I\u2019ve said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">From a road map perspective, we\u2019re not deviating from how we thought about this, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it\u2019s with the product, whether it\u2019s how they get the product, and still a value proposition that makes sense for mass adoption, so that\u2019s all gone very well and that will continue to go very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Libre 3, we launched it, I\u2019d say in Germany the beginning of the year here. A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it, and it\u2019s basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch, so we\u2019ll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3 where we\u2019ve got approval.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Specifically in the U.S., obviously it\u2019s understood that the backlog exists at the FDA regarding diabetes products, and I\u2019m not going to comment on timing here or expectations, but just that we\u2019re very excited to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">That\u2019s helpful, Robert. Just lastly for me, I know I\u2019ve asked about this on a few earnings calls, but I\u2019m just curious how your thoughts on capital allocation are evolving given your strong balance sheet. We know valuations are relatively high. Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? Historically the sweet spot for Abbott has been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range. Is that still the case? Obviously St. Jude was an exception to that, but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on M&amp;A. Thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Well specific to M&amp;A, there\u2019s no change in thoughts there. I think rather than have a number tied to it, it\u2019s more about does it strategically fit, do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it. That mindset hasn\u2019t changed independently of dollar amount there. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re obviously actively looking. We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. What I can say is that we\u2019ve been probably actively monitoring much more than what we were back in 2017, but there are some pretty elevated valuations right now and I\u2019m not going to do anything here that\u2019s going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, etc., and a key driver here is it being strategic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">I actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation, back to how you started the question, was we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity internally, a lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy and support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding manufacturing ramp-up and capacity, whether it\u2019s Libre, whether it\u2019s MitraClip. Seeing an opportunity here with adult nutrition as we\u2019ve seen several years here of strong double-digit growth in nutrition, so I think we\u2019ve got great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Larry Biegelsen</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks Robert.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi guys, thanks for taking the questions. I did want to ask one about COVID testing. We know your guidance for the year here implies lower sales in the last two quarters. I was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you\u2019re seeing in testing, especially outside of the U.S. where we have less visibility, so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you\u2019re baking into the guidance for the rest of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here, and I don\u2019t think over the last 30 days we\u2019ve seen anything materially different. I would say we continue to see some of that lower testing volumes in the U.S., whether it\u2019s PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still, about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side, but we did see higher international sales, and I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably driven by the delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, I\u2019d say, tender-driven, and we\u2019ve got great visibility to where cases are rising, and our positions in those markets as a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing, and what I can say if we\u2019ve definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will. I think we will see some of that. The question will be geographically, where are we going to see it more, and I think geographically we\u2019ll see more internationally than--at least what I think right now, than what we\u2019ll see in the United States from a back half perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Maybe I could just ask one follow-up on recovery in diagnostics versus med tech. I know you called out this issue with blood donations, and I guess excluding that, would you think about the recovery in your core diagnostics business ex-COVID being similar to med tech, should it go in lockstep, or is there going to be a difference there for some reason? Could you flesh out the blood donation headwind, how much is that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, at a high level, I would say we\u2019re seeing kind of that same recovery trend, again within its own segment. Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually as up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019, so we are seeing that recovery on the core lab.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">There are some assays that haven\u2019t recovered as much. What we\u2019ve seen here in the U.S. is that we\u2019re seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays, so when you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019re getting a little bit less of that, but I\u2019d say that\u2019s offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. We\u2019re seeing that kind of high single digit, and as you mentioned, the issue is really low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, of which we\u2019ve got 60%-plus market share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019re hoping to see--you know, we\u2019ve been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here, because obviously there\u2019s inventory of blood but if this rate of donations continues, then it\u2019ll be a challenge for the U.S., so hopefully we\u2019ll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Matt Taylor</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Great, thank you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Good morning and thank you for taking the question. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">It\u2019s really two questions. The first one is a follow-up on what Bob was asking earlier, on is there anything that you can give us on 2022? I\u2019m getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, COVID, double-digit EPS, so anything on a framework basis, that would be helpful. I\u2019d appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. Listen - we\u2019ve talked about this a couple times on a couple calls already. I just think it\u2019s a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast, given there\u2019s so many different moving parts. We\u2019re starting our process right now, but I don\u2019t think the framework changes versus what we\u2019ve talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line, just based on the trends that we\u2019re seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. Our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that\u2019s a factor here. We talked about it last call, it\u2019ll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now, if there is going to be demand for COVID testing, we\u2019ve got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that\u2019s ultimately going to be the factor here. As I said, we\u2019re going to start to lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We\u2019ve obviously had a really strong Q1 also, so that obviously has an impact, and then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn\u2019t detract from our long term, sustainable growth, even past 2022, 2023. We\u2019ve got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity, and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we\u2019ve built upon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks, and then I heard the words pipeline investment a couple of times there. Other than some of the names or products that we\u2019ve already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS, Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you\u2019d like to draw our attention to? Thanks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Yes, sure. Listen - if you look at structural heart, I think there\u2019s two really good opportunities for us over here. TAVR with bringing the product to the U.S. and the launch of our second-generation product in Navitor in Europe - I mean, these are two opportunities that we have. We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we\u2019ll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it will be a great opportunity for us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then the second product on structural heart is our tricuspid repair system. It\u2019s a great opportunity, it\u2019s got a potential billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We\u2019ve done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of the pandemic last year, so I think that\u2019s a great near-term opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then on CRM, we\u2019ve made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber, and then making the investment on a dual chamber. I think that\u2019s another big opportunity that we\u2019ll have to continue our growth recovery in our CRM. We\u2019re targeted to enter this market next year, again with a single chamber, and then build off there. I think we\u2019ve got great opportunity in the device space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Then in the diagnostics, it\u2019s the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We\u2019re obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the placements that we\u2019ve made for ID Now with COVID, to be able to not only drive flu but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunities for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., the next 12, 18 months, and then a larger pipeline after that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Joanne Wuensch</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Scott Leinenweber</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Operator</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you. Our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Jennings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Hi, good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Robert, I just wanted to ask a multi-part question on duopolies in the U.S. market. You\u2019re about to create one with the entrance of Amulet, and then down the line you\u2019ll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor into the edge mitral repair market. I was hoping you could just give us your views on U.S. duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, cannibalizing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue, and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those could play out. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for taking the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"answer\">Robert Ford</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Sure. I think generally speaking, competition will always drive further innovation, further investment, so one could make the analysis here that when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you\u2019ll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. I think on one side, I do believe in that and I think you can see how that\u2019s had an impact definitely when we came into the U.S. with Libre and what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of making all the technologies better, etc. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">The flipside of that is competition is--you know, you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We\u2019ve tried to focus every time we\u2019re entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring, so I think you\u2019ve got these two parts of competition and markets, I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably true for a two-player market or a three-player market. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">But listen, we\u2019re excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We\u2019re obviously a player internationally, and we\u2019re making the investments, so for example we\u2019ve already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our Catalyst trial, which is comparing our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care, and I know that competitors making kind of similar clinical [indiscernible], I think that\u2019s good, I think that\u2019s positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong><span class=\"question\">Josh Jennings</span></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Robert Ford</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Okay, so that being said, I\u2019d say here--if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrate here that we\u2019re showing real strong growth across all of our businesses: devices, diagnostics, our established pharmaceutical business and our nutrition, and as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne\u2019s question, maybe to Bob\u2019s question also, optically you\u2019re going to see a little bit of this, I\u2019d say artificial fog or lapping here, or a comp versus--you know, for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we\u2019ve had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic, but I don\u2019t let that cloud, kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term, and I think our forecast shows here that we\u2019ll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">We\u2019ve got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there is even more on the way here, so we\u2019re very excited about that, and we\u2019re investing across our key growth platforms, so we\u2019re feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we\u2019ve got.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thanks for joining us today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\"><strong>Scott Leinenweber</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible no-summary-bullets\">Thank you Operator, and thank you for all of your questions.
